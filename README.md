# hack'n'lead-2019 Thomson Reuters challenge: The Good Explorers Team 

## 1. Vision / Mission 

*It's all about making better decisions in life.*

Imagine you want to know more about the products you're using or planing to buy.

What if the information you got would make you more aware and informed about modern slavery. 

You could find out what products are built based on the best standards and what ones you should avoid or even fight for better conditions for those involved. 

Visit our website to find out more. 

Yours, The Good Explorers.

## 2. About our approach to the problem we're solving 

a) Based on the data and API's we've got an access to (mainly howgood.com and listofgoods), we first analysed and map the data, mostly products, countries and slavery indexes. 

b) We then developed sentiments over time (child labor, forced labor, prevention efforts)

c) We've implemented the simple and intuitive website where the user can first search for a product and then based on the results scroll in the countries map to further explore and learn about the particular slavery index for that product, country and brand. 

d) In the 2nd phase (depending on our time) we would like to build in more user interaction so that users can enter their suggestions on missing products, countries and brands. That's how we'd like to make users feel more valuable and satisfied.
