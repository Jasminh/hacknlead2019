              <p>Sweeping changes to Ukraine's top law enforcement agency

prosecutors told Reuters. The reorganization, which includes

El Chapo's son</p>
              <p>Mexico's security minister said on Friday that U.S. efforts
to curb the opioid fentanyl were behind the brief arrest of a
son of imprisoned kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman last month

of a group allegedly implicated in a large scheme of smuggling
people into the United States.</p>

make sure that we have the latest information that we need to
have to confront the threat,"" Sales told a briefing.
Spain to host U.N. climate talks in December after Chile
cancels
Spain will host U.N. climate change talks in December after
Chile withdrew, the United Nations said on Friday, a last-minute
switch which raises big logistical challenges and has left
activist Greta Thunberg stranded on the wrong side of the
Atlantic. The U.N. climate change talks, known formally as

              <p>Nov 1 (Reuters) - The largest field of Democratic
presidential candidates in the modern U.S. political era shrank
on Friday when former  congressman Beto O'Rourke of Texas
dropped out after struggling to raise funds for his campaign and
falling behind in opinion polls.</p>
              <p>A top tier of diverse contenders has emerged in a Democratic
field that now numbers 17, including six U.S. senators, a record
five women and black, Hispanic, Asian and openly gay candidates
who would make history if one of them becomes the party's
nominee.</p>
              <p>Here is a graphic https://tmsnrt.rs/2UhJ7WE of the
Republican and Democratic hopefuls to take on President Donald
Trump, the likely Republican nominee, in the November 2020
election.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>DEMOCRATIC TOP TIER</p>
              <p>Top five in Reuters/Ipsos polling:</p>
              <p/>
              <p>JOE BIDEN</p>
              <p>Biden, the early front-runner in opinion polls among
Democratic presidential contenders, waited until late April to
enter the race, launching his bid with a direct swipe at Trump.
Biden, 76, served eight years as President Barack Obama's vice
president and 36 years in the U.S. Senate. He stands at the
center of the Democratic debate over whether the party's
standard-bearer should be a veteran politician or a newcomer,
and whether a liberal or a moderate has a better chance of
defeating Trump. Biden, who frequently notes his ""Middle-Class
Joe"" nickname, touts his working-class roots and ability to work
in a bipartisan fashion. He has been criticized by some fellow
Democrats for his role in passing tough-on-crime legislation in
the 1990s.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>ELIZABETH WARREN</p>
              <p>The 70-year-old U.S. senator from Massachusetts is a leader
of the party's liberals and a fierce critic of Wall Street who
was instrumental in creating the federal Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau (CFPB) after the 2008 financial crisis. Her
campaign has surged in recent weeks, tying or leading Biden in
some polls. She has focused her presidential campaign on a
populist economic message, promising to fight what she calls a
rigged system that favors the wealthy. She has released an array
of policy proposals on everything from breaking up big tech
companies to implementing a ""wealth tax"" on the richest
Americans. Warren has sworn off political fundraising events to
back her campaign.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>BERNIE SANDERS</p>
              <p>The U.S. senator from Vermont lost the Democratic nomination
in 2016 to Hillary Clinton but is trying again. For the 2020
race, Sanders, 78, is fighting to stand out in a field of
progressives running on issues he brought into the Democratic
Party mainstream four years ago.</p>
              <p>Sanders suffered a heart attack while campaigning in Nevada
in October, but there has been little impact so far on his
support.</p>
              <p>His proposals include free tuition at public colleges, a
$15-an-hour minimum wage and universal healthcare. He benefits
from strong name recognition and an unmatched network of
small-dollar donors.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>PETE BUTTIGIEG</p>
              <p>The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, emerged from
virtual anonymity to become one of the party's brightest stars,
building momentum with young voters. A Harvard University
graduate and Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford, he
speaks seven languages conversationally and served in
Afghanistan with the U.S. Navy Reserve. He touts himself as
representing a new generation of leadership needed to combat
Trump. Buttigieg would be the first openly gay presidential
nominee of a major American political party.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>KAMALA HARRIS</p>
              <p>The first-term U.S. senator from California would make
history as the first black woman to gain the nomination. Harris,
55, the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, announced
her candidacy on the holiday honoring slain civil rights leader
Martin Luther King Jr. She supports a middle-class tax credit,
the Green New Deal and marijuana legalization. Her track record
as San Francisco's district attorney and California's attorney
general has drawn scrutiny in a Democratic Party that has grown
more liberal in recent years on criminal justice issues. She saw
a significant bounce in the polls after a high-profile clash
with Biden over race issues during the first Democratic debate
in June but has since seen her numbers drop back down.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>TRYING TO BREAK THROUGH</p>
              <p>The field also includes many Democrats who are looking for a
way to break through. Some hold public office and managed to
generate an early fundraising base, while others are still
trying to raise their profiles.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>ANDREW YANG</p>
              <p>The entrepreneur and former tech executive is focusing his
campaign on an ambitious universal income plan. Yang, 44, wants
to guarantee all Americans between the ages of 18 and 64 a
$1,000 check every month. The son of immigrants from Taiwan,
Yang supports the Medicare for All proposal, which is based on
the existing government-run Medicare program for Americans 65
and older, and has warned that automation is the biggest threat
facing U.S. workers. His campaign has released more than 100
policy ideas, including eclectic proposals like creating an
infrastructure force called the Legion of Builders and
Destroyers. He lives in New York.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>AMY KLOBUCHAR</p>
              <p>The U.S. senator from Minnesota was the first moderate in
the Democratic field vying to challenge Trump. Klobuchar, 59,
gained national attention when she sparred with Brett Kavanaugh
during his Supreme Court nomination hearings last year. On the
campaign trail, the former prosecutor and corporate attorney has
said she would improve on the Affordable Care Act, popularly
known as Obamacare, by adding a public option, and is taking a
hard stance against rising prescription drug prices.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>CORY BOOKER</p>
              <p>Booker, 50, a U.S. senator from New Jersey and former Newark
mayor, gained national prominence in the fight over Kavanaugh's
Supreme Court nomination. Booker, who is black, has made race
relations and racial disparities in the criminal justice system
a focus of his campaign. He embraces progressive positions on
healthcare coverage for every American, the Green New Deal and
other key issues, and touts his style of positivity over
attacks.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>MIRED AT BOTTOM OF OPINION POLLS</p>
              <p>Several candidates are stuck at the bottom according to
numerous polls, with few breakout moments so far.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>TULSI GABBARD</p>
              <p>The Samoan-American congresswoman from Hawaii and Iraq war
veteran is the first Hindu to serve in the U.S. House of
Representatives and has centered her campaign on her anti-war
stance. After working for her father's anti-gay advocacy group
and drafting relevant legislation, she was forced to apologize
for her past views on same-sex marriage. Gabbard's populist,
anti-war approach has won her fans among the far left and the
far right, and she recently engaged in a Twitter war with
Hillary Clinton, whom she called the ""personification of the
rot"" after Clinton suggested Gabbard was being groomed for a
third-party run at the presidency. Gabbard, 38, slammed Trump
for standing by Saudi Arabia after the murder of journalist
Jamal Khashoggi.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>JULIAN CASTRO</p>
              <p>Obama's secretary of housing and urban development would be
the first Hispanic to win a major U.S. party's presidential
nomination. Castro, 45, whose grandmother immigrated to Texas
from Mexico, has used his family's personal story to criticize
Trump's border policies. Castro advocates universal
prekindergarten, supports Medicare for All and cites his
experience to push for affordable housing. He announced his bid
in his hometown of San Antonio, where he once served as mayor
and a city councilman. In the third Democratic debate on Sept.
12, Castro drew jeers from the audience for an attack on Biden
that was perceived as questioning the former vice president's
memory as a way to draw attention to his age.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>TOM STEYER</p>
              <p>The billionaire environmentalist, a force in Democratic
fundraising over the past decade, said in January he was
focusing on his efforts to get Trump impeached and get Democrats
elected to the U.S. Congress. Steyer, 62, reversed course in
July, saying other Democrats had good ideas but ""we won't be
able to get any of those done until we end the hostile corporate
takeover of our democracy.""</p>
              <p/>
              <p>JOHN DELANEY</p>
              <p>The former U.S. representative from Maryland became the
first Democrat to enter the 2020 race, declaring his candidacy
in July 2017. Delaney, 56, says that if elected, he would focus
on advancing only bipartisan bills during the first 100 days of
his presidency. He is also pushing for a universal healthcare
system, raising the federal minimum wage and passing gun safety
legislation. A former business executive, Delaney is
self-funding much of his campaign.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>MICHAEL BENNET</p>
              <p>Bennet, 54, a U.S. senator for Colorado, has based his
political career on improving the American education system. He
previously ran Denver's public schools. Bennet is not well known
nationally but has built a network of political operatives and
donors helping elect other Democrats to the Senate. During the
partial U.S. government shutdown in January, he garnered
national attention criticizing Republicans for stopping the flow
of emergency funds to Colorado.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>STEVE BULLOCK</p>
              <p>Montana's Democratic governor, re-elected in 2016 in a
conservative state that Trump carried by 20 percentage points,
has touted his electability and ability to work across party
lines. Bullock, 53, has made campaign finance reform a
cornerstone of his agenda. He emphasizes his success in forging
compromises with the Republican-led state legislature on bills
to expand the Medicaid healthcare funding program for the poor,
increase campaign finance disclosures, bolster pay equity for
women and protect public lands.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>MARIANNE WILLIAMSON</p>
              <p>The 67-year-old best-selling author, motivational speaker
and Texas native believes her spirituality-focused campaign can
heal the United States. A 1992 interview on Oprah Winfrey's show
led Williamson to make a name for herself as a ""spiritual guide""
for Hollywood and a self-help expert. She is calling for $100
billion in reparations for slavery to be paid over 10 years, gun
control, education reform and equal rights for lesbian and gay
communities.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>WAYNE MESSAM</p>
              <p>Messam, 45, defeated a 16-year incumbent in 2015 to become
the first black mayor of the Miami suburb of Miramar. He was
re-elected in March. The son of Jamaican immigrants, he played
on Florida State University's 1993 national championship
football team and then started a construction business with his
wife. He has pledged to focus on reducing gun violence,
mitigating climate change and reducing student loan debt and the
cost of healthcare. Messam's Twitter profile says he is still
running for president, but federal records show he raised only
$5 during the third quarter of 2019.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>JOE SESTAK</p>
              <p>The retired three-star Navy admiral and former congressman
from Pennsylvania jumped into the race in June. Sestak, 67,
highlighted his 31-year military career and said he was running
to restore U.S. global leadership on challenges like climate
change and China's growing influence. Sestak said he had delayed
his entry in the race to be with his daughter as she
successfully fought a recurrence of brain cancer.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
              <p>Trump is the clear favorite to win the Republican
nomination, and there has been criticism among his opponents
that party leadership has worked to make it impossible for a
challenger. Still, the incumbent will face at least three
rivals.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>DONALD TRUMP</p>
              <p>Serving in his first term, the 73-year-old real estate mogul
shocked the political establishment in 2016 when he secured the
Republican nomination and then won the White House. His raucous
political rallies and prolific use of Twitter were credited with
helping him secure victory. After running as an outsider, Trump
is now focusing his message on the strong economy, while
continuing the anti-immigration rhetoric that characterized his
first campaign as he vies for re-election.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>JOE WALSH</p>
              <p>A former congressman,  Walsh, 57, has become a vocal critic
of Trump, who he argues is not a conservative and is unfit for
public office. Walsh won a House seat from Illinois as a
candidate of the Republican Party's fiscally conservative Tea
Party movement in 2010, but was defeated by Democrat Tammy
Duckworth in his 2012 re-election bid. After leaving Congress,
he became a Chicago-area radio talk-show host.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>BILL WELD</p>
              <p>The 74-year-old former Massachusetts governor ran
unsuccessfully for vice president in 2016 as a Libertarian. He
has been a persistent critic of Trump, saying when he launched
his 2020 campaign that ""the American people are being ignored
and our nation is suffering.""</p>
              <p/>
              <p>MARK SANFORD</p>
              <p>The former South Carolina congressman and longtime Trump
critic lost his seat in the House last year to a Trump supporter
in the Republican nominating primary. Sanford, 59, served two
terms as South Carolina governor from 2003 to 2011 and served in
Congress from 1995 to 2001 and from 2013 to 2019. His term as
governor was marked with scandal when he admitted to traveling
to Argentina to meet his mistress.</p>

dropped out after struggling to raise funds for his campaign and
falling behind in opinion polls.
A top tier of diverse contenders has emerged in a Democratic
field that now numbers 17, including six U.S. senators, a record
five women and black, Hispanic, Asian and openly gay candidates
who would make history if one of them becomes the party's
nominee.
Here is a graphic https://tmsnrt.rs/2UhJ7WE of the
Republican and Democratic hopefuls to take on President Donald
Trump, the likely Republican nominee, in the November 2020
election.

DEMOCRATIC TOP TIER
Top five in Reuters/Ipsos polling:

JOE BIDEN
Biden, the early front-runner in opinion polls among
Democratic presidential contenders, waited until late April to
enter the race, launching his bid with a direct swipe at Trump.
Biden, 76, served eight years as President Barack Obama's vice
president and 36 years in the U.S. Senate. He stands at the
center of the Democratic debate over whether the party's
standard-bearer should be a veteran politician or a newcomer,
and whether a liberal or a moderate has a better chance of
defeating Trump. Biden, who frequently notes his ""Middle-Class
Joe"" nickname, touts his working-class roots and ability to work
in a bipartisan fashion. He has been criticized by some fellow
Democrats for his role in passing tough-on-crime legislation in
the 1990s.

ELIZABETH WARREN
The 70-year-old U.S. senator from Massachusetts is a leader
of the party's liberals and a fierce critic of Wall Street who
was instrumental in creating the federal Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau (CFPB) after the 2008 financial crisis. Her
campaign has surged in recent weeks, tying or leading Biden in
some polls. She has focused her presidential campaign on a
populist economic message, promising to fight what she calls a
rigged system that favors the wealthy. She has released an array
of policy proposals on everything from breaking up big tech
companies to implementing a ""wealth tax"" on the richest
Americans. Warren has sworn off political fundraising events to
back her campaign.

BERNIE SANDERS
The U.S. senator from Vermont lost the Democratic nomination
in 2016 to Hillary Clinton but is trying again. For the 2020
race, Sanders, 78, is fighting to stand out in a field of
progressives running on issues he brought into the Democratic
Party mainstream four years ago.
Sanders suffered a heart attack while campaigning in Nevada
in October, but there has been little impact so far on his
support.
His proposals include free tuition at public colleges, a
$15-an-hour minimum wage and universal healthcare. He benefits
from strong name recognition and an unmatched network of
small-dollar donors.

PETE BUTTIGIEG
The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, emerged from
virtual anonymity to become one of the party's brightest stars,
building momentum with young voters. A Harvard University
graduate and Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford, he
speaks seven languages conversationally and served in
Afghanistan with the U.S. Navy Reserve. He touts himself as
representing a new generation of leadership needed to combat
Trump. Buttigieg would be the first openly gay presidential
nominee of a major American political party.

KAMALA HARRIS
The first-term U.S. senator from California would make
history as the first black woman to gain the nomination. Harris,
55, the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, announced
her candidacy on the holiday honoring slain civil rights leader
Martin Luther King Jr. She supports a middle-class tax credit,
the Green New Deal and marijuana legalization. Her track record
as San Francisco's district attorney and California's attorney
general has drawn scrutiny in a Democratic Party that has grown
more liberal in recent years on criminal justice issues. She saw
a significant bounce in the polls after a high-profile clash
with Biden over race issues during the first Democratic debate
in June but has since seen her numbers drop back down.

TRYING TO BREAK THROUGH
The field also includes many Democrats who are looking for a
way to break through. Some hold public office and managed to
generate an early fundraising base, while others are still
trying to raise their profiles.

ANDREW YANG
The entrepreneur and former tech executive is focusing his
campaign on an ambitious universal income plan. Yang, 44, wants
to guarantee all Americans between the ages of 18 and 64 a
$1,000 check every month. The son of immigrants from Taiwan,
Yang supports the Medicare for All proposal, which is based on
the existing government-run Medicare program for Americans 65
and older, and has warned that automation is the biggest threat
facing U.S. workers. His campaign has released more than 100
policy ideas, including eclectic proposals like creating an
infrastructure force called the Legion of Builders and
Destroyers. He lives in New York.

AMY KLOBUCHAR
The U.S. senator from Minnesota was the first moderate in
the Democratic field vying to challenge Trump. Klobuchar, 59,
gained national attention when she sparred with Brett Kavanaugh
during his Supreme Court nomination hearings last year. On the
campaign trail, the former prosecutor and corporate attorney has
said she would improve on the Affordable Care Act, popularly
known as Obamacare, by adding a public option, and is taking a
hard stance against rising prescription drug prices.

CORY BOOKER
Booker, 50, a U.S. senator from New Jersey and former Newark
mayor, gained national prominence in the fight over Kavanaugh's
Supreme Court nomination. Booker, who is black, has made race
relations and racial disparities in the criminal justice system
a focus of his campaign. He embraces progressive positions on
healthcare coverage for every American, the Green New Deal and
other key issues, and touts his style of positivity over
attacks.

MIRED AT BOTTOM OF OPINION POLLS
Several candidates are stuck at the bottom according to
numerous polls, with few breakout moments so far.

TULSI GABBARD
The Samoan-American congresswoman from Hawaii and Iraq war
veteran is the first Hindu to serve in the U.S. House of
Representatives and has centered her campaign on her anti-war
stance. After working for her father's anti-gay advocacy group
and drafting relevant legislation, she was forced to apologize
for her past views on same-sex marriage. Gabbard's populist,
anti-war approach has won her fans among the far left and the
far right, and she recently engaged in a Twitter war with
Hillary Clinton, whom she called the ""personification of the
rot"" after Clinton suggested Gabbard was being groomed for a
third-party run at the presidency. Gabbard, 38, slammed Trump
for standing by Saudi Arabia after the murder of journalist
Jamal Khashoggi.

JULIAN CASTRO
Obama's secretary of housing and urban development would be
the first Hispanic to win a major U.S. party's presidential
nomination. Castro, 45, whose grandmother immigrated to Texas
from Mexico, has used his family's personal story to criticize
Trump's border policies. Castro advocates universal
prekindergarten, supports Medicare for All and cites his
experience to push for affordable housing. He announced his bid
in his hometown of San Antonio, where he once served as mayor
and a city councilman. In the third Democratic debate on Sept.
12, Castro drew jeers from the audience for an attack on Biden
that was perceived as questioning the former vice president's
memory as a way to draw attention to his age.

TOM STEYER
The billionaire environmentalist, a force in Democratic
fundraising over the past decade, said in January he was
focusing on his efforts to get Trump impeached and get Democrats
elected to the U.S. Congress. Steyer, 62, reversed course in
July, saying other Democrats had good ideas but ""we won't be
able to get any of those done until we end the hostile corporate
takeover of our democracy.""

JOHN DELANEY
The former U.S. representative from Maryland became the
first Democrat to enter the 2020 race, declaring his candidacy
in July 2017. Delaney, 56, says that if elected, he would focus
on advancing only bipartisan bills during the first 100 days of
his presidency. He is also pushing for a universal healthcare
system, raising the federal minimum wage and passing gun safety
legislation. A former business executive, Delaney is
self-funding much of his campaign.

MICHAEL BENNET
Bennet, 54, a U.S. senator for Colorado, has based his
political career on improving the American education system. He
previously ran Denver's public schools. Bennet is not well known
nationally but has built a network of political operatives and
donors helping elect other Democrats to the Senate. During the
partial U.S. government shutdown in January, he garnered
national attention criticizing Republicans for stopping the flow
of emergency funds to Colorado.

STEVE BULLOCK
Montana's Democratic governor, re-elected in 2016 in a
conservative state that Trump carried by 20 percentage points,
has touted his electability and ability to work across party
lines. Bullock, 53, has made campaign finance reform a
cornerstone of his agenda. He emphasizes his success in forging
compromises with the Republican-led state legislature on bills
to expand the Medicaid healthcare funding program for the poor,
increase campaign finance disclosures, bolster pay equity for
women and protect public lands.

MARIANNE WILLIAMSON
The 67-year-old best-selling author, motivational speaker
and Texas native believes her spirituality-focused campaign can
heal the United States. A 1992 interview on Oprah Winfrey's show
led Williamson to make a name for herself as a ""spiritual guide""
for Hollywood and a self-help expert. She is calling for $100
billion in reparations for slavery to be paid over 10 years, gun
control, education reform and equal rights for lesbian and gay
communities.

WAYNE MESSAM
Messam, 45, defeated a 16-year incumbent in 2015 to become
the first black mayor of the Miami suburb of Miramar. He was
re-elected in March. The son of Jamaican immigrants, he played
on Florida State University's 1993 national championship
football team and then started a construction business with his
wife. He has pledged to focus on reducing gun violence,
mitigating climate change and reducing student loan debt and the
cost of healthcare. Messam's Twitter profile says he is still
running for president, but federal records show he raised only
$5 during the third quarter of 2019.

JOE SESTAK
The retired three-star Navy admiral and former congressman
from Pennsylvania jumped into the race in June. Sestak, 67,
highlighted his 31-year military career and said he was running
to restore U.S. global leadership on challenges like climate
change and China's growing influence. Sestak said he had delayed
his entry in the race to be with his daughter as she
successfully fought a recurrence of brain cancer.

THE REPUBLICANS
Trump is the clear favorite to win the Republican
nomination, and there has been criticism among his opponents
that party leadership has worked to make it impossible for a
challenger. Still, the incumbent will face at least three
rivals.

DONALD TRUMP
Serving in his first term, the 73-year-old real estate mogul
shocked the political establishment in 2016 when he secured the
Republican nomination and then won the White House. His raucous
political rallies and prolific use of Twitter were credited with
helping him secure victory. After running as an outsider, Trump
is now focusing his message on the strong economy, while
continuing the anti-immigration rhetoric that characterized his
first campaign as he vies for re-election.

JOE WALSH
A former congressman,  Walsh, 57, has become a vocal critic
of Trump, who he argues is not a conservative and is unfit for
public office. Walsh won a House seat from Illinois as a
candidate of the Republican Party's fiscally conservative Tea
Party movement in 2010, but was defeated by Democrat Tammy
Duckworth in his 2012 re-election bid. After leaving Congress,
he became a Chicago-area radio talk-show host.

BILL WELD
The 74-year-old former Massachusetts governor ran
unsuccessfully for vice president in 2016 as a Libertarian. He
has been a persistent critic of Trump, saying when he launched
his 2020 campaign that ""the American people are being ignored
and our nation is suffering.""

MARK SANFORD
The former South Carolina congressman and longtime Trump
critic lost his seat in the House last year to a Trump supporter
in the Republican nominating primary. Sanford, 59, served two
terms as South Carolina governor from 2003 to 2011 and served in
Congress from 1995 to 2001 and from 2013 to 2019. His term as
governor was marked with scandal when he admitted to traveling
to Argentina to meet his mistress.

BELFAST (Reuters) - A second man was charged with manslaughter over the deaths of 39 people found in the back of a truck near London, British police said on Friday, as they confirmed they now believe all the victims were Vietnamese. 
In Vietnam, police said they had detained two people. 
The discovery of the bodies in a container on an industrial estate has shone a spotlight on the illicit trade that sends the poor of Asia, Africa and the Middle East on perilous journeys to the West.

ARRESTS IN VIETNAM
Vietnamese police said they had arrested two people and summoned others for questioning on Friday after opening a criminal investigation into suspected human trafficking.
British police also appealed on Friday to Ronan Hughes, 40, and his brother Christopher, 34, from Armagh in Northern Ireland, who they said were crucial to their inquiries. They are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking.

BELFAST, Nov 1 (Reuters) - A second man was charged with
manslaughter over the deaths of 39 people found in the back of a
truck near London, British police said on Friday, as they
confirmed they now believe all the victims were Vietnamese.
In Vietnam, police said they had detained two people.
The discovery of the bodies in a container on an industrial

The alleged truck driver has already been charged over the

Northern Ireland, was also accused of 39 counts of manslaughter
as well as human trafficking and immigration offences.

ARRESTS IN VIETNAM
Vietnamese police said they had arrested two people and
summoned others for questioning on Friday after opening a
criminal investigation into suspected human trafficking.
British police also appealed on Friday to Ronan Hughes, 40,
and his brother Christopher, 34, from Armagh in Northern
Ireland, who they said were crucial to their inquiries. They are

              <p>SANTIAGO, Nov 1 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Chile's
decision to quit as host of December's U.N climate talks, to
focus on dealing with violent social protests, has undermined
the Latin American nation’s efforts to craft a green,
progressive image on the world stage, environmentalists said.</p>
              <p>Against a backdrop of civil unrest, which began in
mid-October, the Chilean government announced on Wednesday it
would withdraw as the venue for the U.N. climate conference,
dubbed COP25, with little more than a month to go.</p>
              <p>“This is a sad moment,” Chile’s Environment Minister
Carolina Schmidt told media. “While it was a painful decision to
take, it is also a responsible and necessary one,” she added.</p>
              <p>The conference would have been the first globally
significant environmental gathering to be held in Chile, with
the country set to strengthen its climate change commitments in
line with an already announced plan to phase out coal power.</p>
              <p>The cancellation of the meeting on Chilean soil left a sour
taste for many researchers and climate activists.</p>
              <p>But Schmidt confirmed Chile would at least retain the
presidency of the event, which has been hastily moved to Spain.</p>
              <p>On Friday, the United Nations said the climate talks would
take place in Madrid on the original dates, from Dec. 2-13.</p>
              <p>Schmidt tweeted that Chile would ""continue to reinforce the
work done with the understanding that social and environmental
development go hand in hand"".</p>
              <p>Cristina Dorador, a microbiologist at the University of
Antofagasta and member of a COP25 working group on biodiversity,
said hosting the conference and accompanying events “would have
been an historic opportunity to demand greater environmental
justice and to rethink the effects of climate change on Chile”.</p>
              <p>Chilean scientists agree that the country’s climate is

              <p>Just a week before pulling the plug on a Chilean COP25,

              <p>Since Oct. 19, Chile has been rocked by a wave of nationwide
demonstrations on a scale unseen since the dictatorship of
General Augusto Pinochet, which ended in 1990.</p>
              <p>The unrest started as a student movement opposing a rise in
the rush-hour metro fare in the capital Santiago.</p>
              <p>But protesters have since coalesced around a wide range of
grievances related to socio-economic inequalities in a country
where more than half the population earns 400,000 pesos ($540)

              <p>The Piñera administration responded with a set of reforms
and a cabinet reshuffle that failed to appease the movement.

wage payments to excessive overtime creates a breeding ground
for the worst forms of modern slavery to thrive, the top United

              <p>Businesses are judged only on their efforts to curb extreme

unchecked and likely to lead to even poorer working conditions,
according to U.N. special rapporteur Maria Grazia Giammarinaro.</p>
              <p>Minor labour abuses are so widespread that workers often do
not realise they are being exploited, or are reluctant to speak

              <p>To identify the worst forms of labour abuse in global supply
chains, addressing broader areas of exploitation is essential,
Giammarinaro told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone.</p>

she said, calling for workers to be able to report abuses using

explore further different avenues to make trafficking cases
emerge. I think trafficking should seen by governments not as
criminal issue, primarily, but as a social issue.""</p>
              <p>""But we are not there,"" Giammarinaro added. ""Not at all.""</p>
              <p>Nearly 25 million people worldwide are estimated to be
victims of forced labour, while about 25,000 human trafficking
cases were recorded globally in 2016 - marking a 13-year-high -
according to the latest available data from two U.N. agencies.</p>
              <p>The U.N. expert pointed to laws in Britain and Australia

              <p>The number of informal workers globally is set to swell as
low-skilled labourers lose out to automation and others take

activists who warn of the increased risk of modern slavery.</p>
              <p>Two billion people - more than 60% of the world's workers -
are in informal employment, where they are not covered by formal
arrangements, such as a contract, or lack protections including
sick pay, U.N. International Labour Organization data shows.</p>
              <p>""We have to admit that (exploitation) is embedded in our
economic systems,"" Giammarinaro said. ""This is something that's
changed, the perception about trafficking and forced labour.""</p>

activists who warn of the increased risk of modern slavery.
Two billion people - more than 60% of the world's workers -
are in informal employment, where they are not covered by formal
arrangements, such as a contract, or lack protections including
sick pay, U.N. International Labour Organization data shows.
""We have to admit that (exploitation) is embedded in our
economic systems,"" Giammarinaro said. ""This is something that's
changed, the perception about trafficking and forced labour.""
""They were perceived as marginal ... mostly linked with
criminal activity,"" she added. ""It is actually a sort of
parallel labour market which exists everywhere.""

              <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Apple TV+, the iPhone maker's
entry into the crowded streaming TV market, debuts on Friday as
the first ""all-original"" subscription video service, according
to Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook.</p>
              <p>All of the programming is original because, unlike Netflix
Inc and the forthcoming Disney+ from Walt Disney Co
, Apple does not have rights to a back catalog of TV

              <p>That makes Apple's offering relatively slim compared to
other online video services. It is also cheaper
than competitors at $4.99 per month. And anyone who has
purchased an iPhone, iPad, Apple TV device, iPod touch or Mac
after Sept. 10 can get a free subscription for one year.</p>
              <p>Cook, in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, said he
welcomes the wide range of competition in streaming video
because he believes it will encourage more people to drop cable
television and seek digital entertainment options.</p>

increased prison time for a former army general and more than
fifty others convicted in the country's largest human
trafficking trial.</p>
              <p>The case, which involved 103 defendants, began in 2015 after
a crackdown following the gruesome discovery of dozens of
shallow graves in jungle camps near the Thai-Malaysian border.</p>
              <p>Traffickers had been using the camps to hold mostly Rohingya
Muslim migrants hostage until their relatives were able to pay
for their release, authorities said.</p>
              <p>In 2017, a criminal court sentenced 62 defendants on 13
different charges, including trafficking in persons, smuggling
illegal migrants into the country and organised crime.</p>
              <p>The appeals court late on Thursday dismissed convictions for
two defendants while increasing the jail terms for 55 others
with additional charges of smuggling illegal migrants. Some of
these were also given additional prison time for multiple human
trafficking charges.</p>
              <p>Those receiving longer sentences include former army
Lieutenant General Manas Kongpan, who saw his 27-year prison
term for trafficking and corruption increased to 82 years.</p>
              <p>Banjong Pongphol, an ex-mayor of Padang Besar in Songkhla
province, saw his prison sentence increased to 79 years from 78.</p>
              <p>The court also upheld the harshest sentence of 94 years for
Soe Naing, a Rohingya man who the authorities said is a key
figure behind the trafficking network. He was found guilty of
assault causing death and human trafficking.</p>
              <p>The state prosecutor or the defendants can still lodge an
appeal against the verdict within 30 days. A further appeal
would push the case to the Supreme Court, the final court in the
Thai justice system.</p>
              <p>Myanmar regards Rohingya as illegal migrants from the Indian
subcontinent and has confined tens of thousands to sprawling
camps in Rakhine state since violence swept the area in 2012.</p>
              <p>The unrest prompted tens of thousands of Rohingya to flee
Myanmar by sea. This exodus by boat peaked in 2015, when an
estimated 25,000 people crossed the Andaman Sea for Thailand,
Malaysia and Indonesia, many drowning as unsafe and overloaded
boats capsized.</p>
              <p>When violence broke out again in Rakhine state in 2017, more
than 700,000 Rohingya crossed into Bangladesh fleeing an army
crackdown, according to U.N. agencies.

increased prison time for a former army general and more than
fifty others convicted in the country's largest human
trafficking trial.
The case, which involved 103 defendants, began in 2015 after
a crackdown following the gruesome discovery of dozens of
shallow graves in jungle camps near the Thai-Malaysian border.
Traffickers had been using the camps to hold mostly Rohingya
Muslim migrants hostage until their relatives were able to pay
for their release, authorities said.
In 2017, a criminal court sentenced 62 defendants on 13
different charges, including trafficking in persons, smuggling
illegal migrants into the country and organised crime.
The appeals court late on Thursday dismissed convictions for
two defendants while increasing the jail terms for 55 others
with additional charges of smuggling illegal migrants. Some of
these were also given additional prison time for multiple human
trafficking charges.
Those receiving longer sentences include former army
Lieutenant General Manas Kongpan, who saw his 27-year prison
term for trafficking and corruption increased to 82 years.
Banjong Pongphol, an ex-mayor of Padang Besar in Songkhla
province, saw his prison sentence increased to 79 years from 78.
The court also upheld the harshest sentence of 94 years for
Soe Naing, a Rohingya man who the authorities said is a key
figure behind the trafficking network. He was found guilty of
assault causing death and human trafficking.
The state prosecutor or the defendants can still lodge an
appeal against the verdict within 30 days. A further appeal
would push the case to the Supreme Court, the final court in the
Thai justice system.
Myanmar regards Rohingya as illegal migrants from the Indian
subcontinent and has confined tens of thousands to sprawling
camps in Rakhine state since violence swept the area in 2012.
The unrest prompted tens of thousands of Rohingya to flee
Myanmar by sea. This exodus by boat peaked in 2015, when an
estimated 25,000 people crossed the Andaman Sea for Thailand,
Malaysia and Indonesia, many drowning as unsafe and overloaded
boats capsized.
When violence broke out again in Rakhine state in 2017, more
than 700,000 Rohingya crossed into Bangladesh fleeing an army
crackdown, according to U.N. agencies.

              <p>KAIROUAN, Tunisia, Nov 1 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - If
pushed to sacrifice showering, cooking, drinking or raising his
chickens, Tunisian farmer Saeed Barhoumi said he would first
forgo showering. It is a decision that he and his family
frequently face.</p>
              <p>The closest source of clean water is a collective tap that
is a 4-km (2.5-mile) walk away from their isolated home on an
arid plain in the northern region of Kairouan.</p>
              <p>No pipes or roads run to their house and they are not
serviced by the volunteer-run collectives, known as Agricultural
Development Groups (GDA), who are tasked with bringing water
from wells to more than half the region's inhabitants.</p>
              <p>""We used to grow much more wheat, we used to plant tomatoes,
but we don't have (enough) water,"" said Barhoumi, overlooking
the dusty hills stretching out in front of his doorstep.</p>
              <p>Poor planning, sparse water resources and the worsening
impacts of climate change have combined to create a crippling
water crisis in Tunisia, say civil society groups.</p>
              <p>In 2018 more than 94% of Tunisians had access to water,
either through the national supplier or the GDA, according to
official figures.</p>
              <p>But Alaa Marzougui, coordinator at the non-governmental
organisation Nomad08 for socio-economic and cultural rights,
estimates the real number is significantly lower.</p>
              <p>Due to random cuts to water supplies, debt and management
issues with the GDAs and the poor quality of water that runs
from the taps, Marzougui said about three-quarters of the
population have problems accessing clean water.</p>
              <p>Data from the ministry of agriculture shows the total amount
of water available in the country can provide 420 cubic metres
per person per year, making it a ""very water scarce country"", by
U.N. Water standards.</p>
              <p>The country's irregular rainfall patterns are accentuated by
climate change, with periods of droughts and record high
temperatures oscillating between torrential rain and floods,
according to the agriculture ministry.</p>
              <p>The latest government figures also reveal that poor
infrastructure means in some regions about half of water is lost
before it even reaches the tap.</p>
              <p>""We monopolise more than 90% of our water - what we have we
are already using,"" said Imen Louati, research officer at the
non-governmental Tunisian Economic Observatory (OTE).</p>
              <p>ARID LIVING</p>
              <p>In Kairouan, water drains a quarter of the Barhoumi family's
monthly budget. Eleven plastic cylinders of varying heights sit
in their courtyard, storing water for use by 11 people, as well
as a small wheat crop and some chickens.</p>
              <p>It is mostly women who carry the burden of fetching water,
said Minyara Mejbri, regional coordinator of the Tunisian Forum
for Economic and Social Rights in Kairouan.</p>
              <p>""They might spend the whole day working in the field, then
prepare dinner, then take the container to the communal tap,
where they often have to queue for one hour,"" she said.</p>
              <p>In 2015, Barhoumi's nine-year-old daughter Ahlem killed
herself, a tragedy that the family puts down to the remoteness
of their home and the lack of resources, including water.</p>
              <p>""She dreamt of another life, to live near her school,"" said
her grandmother, Massouda, who had walked with Ahlem to collect
20 litres of rainwater that day.</p>
              <p>""Here, she has no shower, no friends, all her dreams are
elsewhere.""</p>
              <p>CUTS AND LEAKS</p>
              <p>Even for houses on the grid, water is not guaranteed.
Nomad08 recorded 3,000 cuts between 2016 and 2018 across the
country, lasting up to 60 days at a time.</p>
              <p>During the Eid al-Adha holiday in August, as families
gathered in the scorching heat to feast and celebrate, many
regions experienced cuts to their water supply for three days,
sparking protests and road blockages.</p>
              <p>""It is annoying, but we're used to it now,"" said Lamia
Smaine Dhib, a housewife on a farm in Kelibia, one of the towns
affected.</p>
              <p>""We need a lot of water during Eid - for cooking, showering,
for washing the intestines of the sheep,"" she said, referring to
the traditional method for preparing meat during the holiday.</p>
              <p>""The infrastructure is bad, we lose water in the
distribution network. The summer months are peak tourist season,
so there is a lot of water consumption,"" said Louati of the OTE.</p>
              <p>""And because of climate change, the availability of water
varies more than before.""</p>
              <p>IN SEARCH OF SOLUTIONS</p>
              <p>In 2017, the minister of agriculture created a committee
dedicated to prioritising climate change in the management of
agriculture and water.</p>
              <p>""We are in front of a fait accompli - we need to do with
what we have and it is only going to become less (water),"" said
Rafik Aini, coordinator of the committee and senior negotiator

KAIROUAN, Tunisia, Nov 1 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - If
pushed to sacrifice showering, cooking, drinking or raising his
chickens, Tunisian farmer Saeed Barhoumi said he would first
forgo showering. It is a decision that he and his family
frequently face.
The closest source of clean water is a collective tap that
is a 4-km (2.5-mile) walk away from their isolated home on an
arid plain in the northern region of Kairouan.
No pipes or roads run to their house and they are not
serviced by the volunteer-run collectives, known as Agricultural
Development Groups (GDA), who are tasked with bringing water
from wells to more than half the region's inhabitants.
""We used to grow much more wheat, we used to plant tomatoes,
but we don't have (enough) water,"" said Barhoumi, overlooking
the dusty hills stretching out in front of his doorstep.
Poor planning, sparse water resources and the worsening
impacts of climate change have combined to create a crippling
water crisis in Tunisia, say civil society groups.
In 2018 more than 94% of Tunisians had access to water,
either through the national supplier or the GDA, according to
official figures.
But Alaa Marzougui, coordinator at the non-governmental
organisation Nomad08 for socio-economic and cultural rights,
estimates the real number is significantly lower.
Due to random cuts to water supplies, debt and management
issues with the GDAs and the poor quality of water that runs
from the taps, Marzougui said about three-quarters of the
population have problems accessing clean water.
Data from the ministry of agriculture shows the total amount
of water available in the country can provide 420 cubic metres
per person per year, making it a ""very water scarce country"", by
U.N. Water standards.
The country's irregular rainfall patterns are accentuated by
climate change, with periods of droughts and record high
temperatures oscillating between torrential rain and floods,
according to the agriculture ministry.
The latest government figures also reveal that poor
infrastructure means in some regions about half of water is lost
before it even reaches the tap.
""We monopolise more than 90% of our water - what we have we
are already using,"" said Imen Louati, research officer at the
non-governmental Tunisian Economic Observatory (OTE).
ARID LIVING
In Kairouan, water drains a quarter of the Barhoumi family's
monthly budget. Eleven plastic cylinders of varying heights sit
in their courtyard, storing water for use by 11 people, as well
as a small wheat crop and some chickens.
It is mostly women who carry the burden of fetching water,
said Minyara Mejbri, regional coordinator of the Tunisian Forum
for Economic and Social Rights in Kairouan.
""They might spend the whole day working in the field, then
prepare dinner, then take the container to the communal tap,
where they often have to queue for one hour,"" she said.
In 2015, Barhoumi's nine-year-old daughter Ahlem killed
herself, a tragedy that the family puts down to the remoteness
of their home and the lack of resources, including water.
""She dreamt of another life, to live near her school,"" said
her grandmother, Massouda, who had walked with Ahlem to collect
20 litres of rainwater that day.
""Here, she has no shower, no friends, all her dreams are
elsewhere.""
CUTS AND LEAKS
Even for houses on the grid, water is not guaranteed.
Nomad08 recorded 3,000 cuts between 2016 and 2018 across the
country, lasting up to 60 days at a time.
During the Eid al-Adha holiday in August, as families
gathered in the scorching heat to feast and celebrate, many
regions experienced cuts to their water supply for three days,
sparking protests and road blockages.
""It is annoying, but we're used to it now,"" said Lamia
Smaine Dhib, a housewife on a farm in Kelibia, one of the towns
affected.
""We need a lot of water during Eid - for cooking, showering,
for washing the intestines of the sheep,"" she said, referring to
the traditional method for preparing meat during the holiday.
""The infrastructure is bad, we lose water in the
distribution network. The summer months are peak tourist season,
so there is a lot of water consumption,"" said Louati of the OTE.
""And because of climate change, the availability of water
varies more than before.""
IN SEARCH OF SOLUTIONS
In 2017, the minister of agriculture created a committee
dedicated to prioritising climate change in the management of
agriculture and water.
""We are in front of a fait accompli - we need to do with
what we have and it is only going to become less (water),"" said
Rafik Aini, coordinator of the committee and senior negotiator
in climate change at the agriculture ministry.
Tunisia's new Water Code, which was approved by ministers in
September and is waiting to be debated by parliament, includes
climate change as a factor to be considered in water policy
decisions, unlike the original 1975 code.
In addition to repairing the water network, Aini told the
Thomson Reuters Foundation that the government's 2050 strategy
for water will involve desalination projects powered by
renewable energy.
But desalination, which removes salt from both sea-water and
groundwater, ""does not solve the problem"", said Tunisian water
expert Raoudha Gafrej.
""It costs a lot of money and there is still (more) water
lost through the network (than desalination stations are
projected to produce).""
There is also an environmental cost. In January, a study by
the U.N. University Institute for Water, Environment and Health
(UNU-INWEH) warned that the global levels of surplus salty brine
produced by this method were 50% higher than previous estimates.
Desalination would also have ""profound impacts"" on the sea
ecosystem, where this waste is mostly dumped, the report found.
In tackling Tunisia's water crisis, the ""politics of
agriculture needs to change,"" said Gafrej. ""With precious and
rare water, we do not have the right to produce certain cultures
like watermelons.""
Currently, about 80% of Tunisia's natural water resources
are used for agriculture, according to last year's government
figures. Thirsty crops like oranges, watermelons and tomatoes
are grown for export abroad, mostly to Europe.
In intensive farming regions, like Kairouan, groundwater is

up to 400% in certain regions.
Aini agreed that decisions about what crops should be grown
are important but ""this is for the new government (elected on

              <p>DAKAR, Oct 31 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Speaking calmly
through tears, in a hearing streamed live on YouTube, former
beauty queen Fatou Jallow told how Gambia's ex-president Yahya
Jammeh locked her in a room and raped her.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old's testimony on Thursday concluded three
weeks of public hearings dedicated to sexual and gender-based
violence under Jammeh's presidency, part of a broader probe by
the current administration into abuses during his tenure.</p>
              <p>""Yahya Jammeh did not want sex with me or pleasure with me.
What he wanted to do was hurt me,"" said Jallow, explaining that
he violently assaulted her after she refused his advances.</p>
              <p>The Thomson Reuters Foundation was unable to verify Jallow's
account or that of another woman who testified to being raped by
two security officers in jail and a third who said she was raped
by Jammeh's interior minister.</p>
              <p>Jammeh fled into exile in Equatorial Guinea in 2017 after
losing an election that ended his 22-year-rule over the tiny
West African country - a period marked by killings, torture and
forced disappearances.</p>
              <p>The Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission
(TRRC), an initiative of current President Adama Barrow, opened
in January with an aim to investigate suspected atrocities under
Jammeh and consider reparations for victims.</p>
              <p>But the many harrowing tales of rape and sexual abuse also
seek to break down the silence around a problem which continues,
if not at such high levels, human rights campaigners said.</p>
              <p>""I know it makes people uncomfortable. But it's okay to be
uncomfortable as a society before we shift things around,""
Jallow said in her hearing.</p>
              <p>One in five women in The Gambia have experienced physical or
sexual violence at the hands of an intimate partner, according
to the United Nations, with rape often not reported because
women fear reprisals or stigma.</p>
              <p>""Hopefully this will start a conversation in Gambia about
sexual violence and about the abuse of women and girls,"" said
Reed Brody, a lawyer working with Jallow and other victims.</p>
              <p>The 11-member TRRC, which is expected to sit for two years,
can make criminal referrals and many victims want to see Jammeh
return to Gambia to face trial for the abuses it investigates.</p>
              <p>But that seems unlikely given the warm welcome he has
received from Equatorial Guinea's President Teodoro Obiang.</p>
              <p>Three women have accused Jammeh personally of sexual assault
or rape, including one who chose to submit a private statement
to the commission instead of going public, according to Brody.</p>
              <p>When asked why they testified, several women said it was to
raise awareness about sexual assault and embolden other victims
to come forward.</p>
              <p>""Those men didn't think that a day like this would come,""
said a woman who was one of Jammeh's ""protocol girls"", young
women hired to work in the Protocol Department in the
presidential palace.</p>
              <p>The woman, who testified anonymously, said that Jammeh
treated the protocol girls ""like his own property"" and that she
was fired after refusing his advances.</p>
              <p>""I know certain people that are still working - they are
still in the system, they are still in government. Maybe hearing
this they will be a little more careful about what they do,"" she
said.</p>
              <p>One challenge has been to involve women in rural areas who
may be less educated, said Didier Gbery, head of programme for
the International Center for Transitional Justice's (ICTJ) in
The Gambia.</p>
              <p>The U.S.-headquartered advocacy group is working with
women's groups throughout The Gambia to collect more testimonies
for the TRRC, he said.</p>
              <p>""This is an opportunity to scrutinise our society and to try
to make this change,"" Gbery said.</p>

The Thomson Reuters Foundation was unable to verify Jallow's
account or that of another woman who testified to being raped by
two security officers in jail and a third who said she was raped
by Jammeh's interior minister.
Jammeh fled into exile in Equatorial Guinea in 2017 after
losing an election that ended his 22-year-rule over the tiny
West African country - a period marked by killings, torture and
forced disappearances.
The Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission
(TRRC), an initiative of current President Adama Barrow, opened
in January with an aim to investigate suspected atrocities under
Jammeh and consider reparations for victims.
But the many harrowing tales of rape and sexual abuse also
seek to break down the silence around a problem which continues,
if not at such high levels, human rights campaigners said.
""I know it makes people uncomfortable. But it's okay to be
uncomfortable as a society before we shift things around,""
Jallow said in her hearing.
One in five women in The Gambia have experienced physical or
sexual violence at the hands of an intimate partner, according
to the United Nations, with rape often not reported because
women fear reprisals or stigma.
""Hopefully this will start a conversation in Gambia about
sexual violence and about the abuse of women and girls,"" said
Reed Brody, a lawyer working with Jallow and other victims.
The 11-member TRRC, which is expected to sit for two years,
can make criminal referrals and many victims want to see Jammeh
return to Gambia to face trial for the abuses it investigates.
But that seems unlikely given the warm welcome he has
received from Equatorial Guinea's President Teodoro Obiang.
Three women have accused Jammeh personally of sexual assault
or rape, including one who chose to submit a private statement
to the commission instead of going public, according to Brody.
When asked why they testified, several women said it was to
raise awareness about sexual assault and embolden other victims
to come forward.
""Those men didn't think that a day like this would come,""
said a woman who was one of Jammeh's ""protocol girls"", young
women hired to work in the Protocol Department in the
presidential palace.
The woman, who testified anonymously, said that Jammeh
treated the protocol girls ""like his own property"" and that she
was fired after refusing his advances.
""I know certain people that are still working - they are
still in the system, they are still in government. Maybe hearing
this they will be a little more careful about what they do,"" she
said.
One challenge has been to involve women in rural areas who
may be less educated, said Didier Gbery, head of programme for
the International Center for Transitional Justice's (ICTJ) in
The Gambia.
The U.S.-headquartered advocacy group is working with
women's groups throughout The Gambia to collect more testimonies
for the TRRC, he said.
""This is an opportunity to scrutinise our society and to try
to make this change,"" Gbery said.

Climate Action Network International, which represents
hundreds of environmental campaign groups, warned Chile's move
""must not detract from the political urgency to address the
climate crisis"" through emissions reductions and stronger
efforts to adapt to wilder weather and rising seas.
""These are essential ingredients for climate justice. The
postponing of the COP must not be used as an excuse to delay
this,"" the network said in a statement.
Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, head of climate and energy work for
conservation group WWF and president of the 2014 talks in Lima,
called for a fast U.N. response in announcing updated plans for
the conference.
“We encourage world leaders to continue to support the
process and show it by stepping up their own country pledges, to
ensure an extremely ambitious 2020,” he added.
Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, governments have committed
to regularly strengthen targets in their national plans to lower
planet-warming emissions, in order to meet global goals to curb
rising temperatures.
They are due to submit their first revised plans by the end
of 2020.
Ahead of that, the COP25 meeting is tasked with finishing
work on the Paris pact rules, including those that will govern
carbon markets.
A U.N. climate secretariat (UNFCCC) spokesman said the
conference could be held at a U.N. building or in another
country if a government offers. Preferably the meeting would
happen in December as planned, he said.
But the logistics and cost of hosting a COP are daunting,
and Costa Rica - where a preparatory meeting for the Chile
gathering took place recently - said on Wednesday it could not
take on the challenge.
The conference could be hosted in Germany, as the UNFCCC
office is located in Bonn and interim sessions are held there
each year, but that would require an invitation from the German
government, the spokesman said.

KEEP TALKING
Human rights and green groups also expressed concern about
what the cancellation of the event in Chile might mean for
ongoing protests there, which have resulted in close to 20
deaths, 7,000 arrests and business losses of about $1.4 billion.
They urged Chilean leaders to consider environmental issues
as part of reforms to meet the demands of protesters, who want
the government to address social inequalities.
Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said on Wednesday he had
taken the ""painful"" decision to cancel COP25, as well as an
Asia-Pacific economic summit next month, to focus on restoring
law and order and pushing through a new social plan.
The United Nations has said it will send a team to
investigate allegations of human rights abuses by Chile's
security forces during the unrest.
""The same flawed economic policies that have sparked
protests on the streets of Chile are fuelling the global climate
crisis and the global inequality crisis,"" said Asier Hernando,
deputy director of Oxfam in Latin America and the Caribbean.
""Urgent action is needed by governments to build economies
that put people and the environment before economic growth and
corporate profits,” he added.
Some climate change experts and diplomats said they
understood the decision not to host the U.N. climate talks in
Chile given security concerns and the need to focus on domestic
problems.
Others, however, warned the decision should not shut down
debate on environmental and social injustices in the troubled
Latin American nation and beyond.
“Postponing a meeting doesn't postpone climate change and
its impacts,"" said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of
Greenpeace International.
""All over the world, people are clamouring for change. The
channels for dialogue have to be kept open,"" she added.

At least 150 million people, about 2% of the global

As the U.N. marks World Cities Day on Thursday, here are
eight dwelling types which highlight how cities are coping with

CAGE HOMES
Hong Kong's property prices have rocketed over 200% in the
past decade driven by limited housing supply and large capital
flows from mainland Chinese buyers, forcing some of the city's
poorest to live in often squalid conditions.
Tens of thousands are crammed into rooftop shanties,
so-called cage homes with plywood bunk beds, or into tiny
partitioned flats averaging just 62 sq ft (6 sq m).

SLEEPING PODS
As rising prices push city workers to live further from the
centre and endure long commutes, sleep pods which allow for a
power nap near the office have popped up from Madrid and London
to New York.
In the British capital, start-up Pop & Rest offers busy
travellers, flagging party-goers and restless new parents a bed
in a tiny dark room scented with lavender and outfitted with ear
plugs and eye masks for less than 20 pounds ($26) an hour.

GARDEN HOMES
As part of a project to help refugees find homes in France,
local non-profit Quatorze has installed tiny wooden houses
insulated with cardboard in some Paris backyards.
The first was set up in a family's garden in the eastern
suburb of Montreuil in 2017, with an Afghan refugee as its
tenant. A second was installed at the back of an art gallery in
the same district earlier this year.

GRANNY FLATS
A growing number of homeowners in the U.S. capital of
Washington - among the country's most expensive cities - have
turned townhouse basements or garages into small living units
to rent out, often to help cover mortgage costs.
Known as granny flats, mother-in-law suites or English
basements, these conversions are gaining in popularity across
the U.S. as a way to boost affordable housing, according to
property experts.

LIVE-IN GUARDIANS
Up to 7,000 people are serving as guardians in empty
properties across Britain, mainly in London, according to a 2018
report by the London Assembly, an elected body that scrutinizes
the activities of the mayor.
Guardians pay low rents in exchange for securing buildings
from squatters and vandals, but sometimes live in poorly
maintained mouldy homes with few legal protections, the report

SHIPPING CONTAINERS
Thousands of homeless children in Britain are being forced
to sleep in often overcrowded converted shipping containers that
are ""blisteringly hot"" in summer and ""freezing"" in winter, a
report by Children's Commissioner for England said in August.

EGG HOUSE
A Chinese man named Dai Haifei made international headlines
in 2010 when, unable to afford Beijing's high rental prices, he
lived for a few months in an homemade egg-shaped mobile house
near his office in the city.
The house was made of bamboo strips, steel bars, heat
prevention and waterproof materials, sacks filled with fermented
wood chips and grass seeds, as well as one solar panel, local

restaurant serving edible insects.</p>
              <p>His latest recipe consists of almond cream pear tart served

worms lying on top, you wouldn't realise that the icecream
itself is made of powdered silk worms.</p>

              <p>""I don't think I'll ever get bored (with cooking insects),

              <p>Nutritionists and scientists have been touting insects as

cattle or pigs and require significantly less land and water
than cattle, according to the United Nations' Food and

              <p>While eating insects is already part of a normal diet for
Thai people in rural areas, 35-year-old Buttama says it is often

              <p>""Thais associate eating insects with poor people, which is a

is part of an elaborate courtship ritual requiring consent from
both parents, but is now widely abused to justify early
marriages.</p>

children and chickens roam the streets. ""We rode off on a

according to campaign group Girls Not Brides. They face greater
risks of exploitation, sexual violence, domestic abuse and death
in childbirth.</p>

poverty and tradition lead to one in nine girls being married
before age 18, according to official statistics.</p>

ranks among Indonesia's top 10 for child marriage.</p>
              <p>Lombok's bride kidnapping ritual dates back generations
among the Sasak, an ethnic Muslim group of about 3 million who
mostly live on the island east of the resort destination Bali.</p>
              <p>At one time, negotiations were held between families after a
Sasak man set his sights on a woman, in contrast to bride
kidnappings plaguing countries like Kyrgyzstan, Mali and
Ethiopia.</p>
              <p>The man would then take the woman to an agreed location to

              <p>In Lombok, which sends one of the highest numbers of

marry. It also alleviates a financial burden.</p>
              <p>""It is done in the name of tradition, so people just accept
it blindly regardless if it is right or wrong,"" said Faozan, of
the local non-profit Village Children Protection Group.</p>
              <p>Faozan, who like many Indonesians uses one name, said
rampant underage marriage on Lombok has been linked to social
ills ranging from divorce to unplanned pregnancies, maternal
deaths and stunting among children.</p>
              <p>In addition, Islamic ceremonies are common. Islamic law
permits such unions but because they are not formally registered
women are often denied their rights and maintenance payments in
the case of divorce.</p>
              <p>Yani, who was married under Islamic law and divorced by her
husband a month before she gave birth, is struggling to get her
baby a birth certificate as her marriage was never formally
registered.</p>
              <p>Indonesia's Women Empowerment and Child Protection Ministry
said in a recent statement that it planned to raise awareness
through education among children, parents and religious leaders

              <p>The change came after Indonesia's top court last year ruled
in favour of a petition by women's rights groups who argued the
rule discriminated against girls, who could marry at 16 while

""What better way for Gareth to show how much HIV has changed
than by showing his muscles on the front of Men's Health?,"" said
Debbie Laycock, the head of policy at leading British HIV/AIDS
charity the Terrence Higgins Trust.
""Gareth has already done so much to change people's
perceptions of what an HIV diagnosis means and it's brilliant to
see him be the first person openly living with HIV on the front
cover of the magazine all about being fit and active.""

Bangladeshi women who return home after being tortured and
abused working in the Middle East rarely get justice because
brokers intimidate them and they cannot afford legal aid, a
rights group said on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>In interviews with 110 returnees, 86% did not receive their
full salaries, 61% were physically abused, 24% were deprived of
food and 14% were sexually abused, local migrant rights group
Ovibashi Karmi Unnayan Program (OKUP) found.</p>
              <p>Nuri Begum went to court in August seeking compensation from
her broker, or dalal, after she was tortured and worked unpaid
as a maid for a family in Saudi Arabia for two months, and then
spent two months in jail before flying home to Bangladesh.</p>
              <p>""My dalal beat me up and broke my leg when I filed a case
against him,"" Begum told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""I was

              <p>LONDON, Oct 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - She's been
called the female Banksy, but acclaimed street artist Bambi is
sick of how the media portrays women, saying it builds them up
only to knock them down.</p>
              <p>""We're in a man's world, I feel, everything is judged
against what a man would do,"" said the graffiti artist, as she
unveiled her newest work in London.</p>
              <p>""Women are always on the back foot.""</p>
              <p>Like Banksy, Bambi insists on going incognito so the focus
stays on her work, though her graffiti is yet to fetch the sort
of record prices notched up by her fellow artist.</p>
              <p>His latest work, depicting primates sitting in Britain’s
parliament, sold for more than $12 million this month: a record
Banksy price, according to Sotheby's auction house.</p>
              <p>On Wednesday, Bambi sprayed a lifesize picture of a female
graffiti artist on a north London wall, mocking celebrity
culture's depiction of women. As she painted, her identity was
shrouded by a tent and she spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
              <p>The artwork showed 22 sprayed Hollywood-style stars, each
emblazoned with the name of an artistic ""hero"" - from
suffragette Emily Davison to singer Nina Simone - and all
purportedly sprayed by the sassy, central figure.</p>
              <p>The tagline read: 'weapon of voice'.</p>
              <p>Bambi said women in the public eye were ""dehumanised"" and
silenced, be it British lawmaker Jo Cox, murdered a week before
the 2016 Brexit referendum, or Meghan Markle, wife of Prince
Harry and subject of heavy tabloid speculation.</p>
              <p>""It's difficult because you know we want to look at women in
'Hello' magazine...so they're almost public property, but the
whole paparazzi harassment is terrible,"" she said in an
exclusive interview staged alongside her freshly sprayed work.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>MALE BAMBI</p>
              <p>Bambi, whose art is owned by reality TV star Kim Kardashian,

LONDON, Oct 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - She's been
called the female Banksy, but acclaimed street artist Bambi is
sick of how the media portrays women, saying it builds them up
only to knock them down.
""We're in a man's world, I feel, everything is judged
against what a man would do,"" said the graffiti artist, as she
unveiled her newest work in London.
""Women are always on the back foot.""
Like Banksy, Bambi insists on going incognito so the focus
stays on her work, though her graffiti is yet to fetch the sort
of record prices notched up by her fellow artist.
His latest work, depicting primates sitting in Britain’s
parliament, sold for more than $12 million this month: a record
Banksy price, according to Sotheby's auction house.
On Wednesday, Bambi sprayed a lifesize picture of a female
graffiti artist on a north London wall, mocking celebrity
culture's depiction of women. As she painted, her identity was
shrouded by a tent and she spoke on condition of anonymity.
The artwork showed 22 sprayed Hollywood-style stars, each
emblazoned with the name of an artistic ""hero"" - from
suffragette Emily Davison to singer Nina Simone - and all
purportedly sprayed by the sassy, central figure.
The tagline read: 'weapon of voice'.
Bambi said women in the public eye were ""dehumanised"" and
silenced, be it British lawmaker Jo Cox, murdered a week before
the 2016 Brexit referendum, or Meghan Markle, wife of Prince
Harry and subject of heavy tabloid speculation.
""It's difficult because you know we want to look at women in
'Hello' magazine...so they're almost public property, but the
whole paparazzi harassment is terrible,"" she said in an
exclusive interview staged alongside her freshly sprayed work.

MALE BAMBI
Bambi, whose art is owned by reality TV star Kim Kardashian,
singer Adele and actor Brad Pitt, came to fame in 2009 and says
she finds comparisons with Banksy ""irritating and flattering"".
""Actually, he's the male Bambi,"" she said.
The cafe wall picture is part of a new series where women
will dominate, Bambi said, with the original canvas to be sold
at auction to benefit the Eve Appeal charity, which supports
women with gynaecological cancer.
Bambi said that art should entertain but also make a social
comment, especially in the aftermath of #MeToo two years ago.
The movement erupted after multiple women accused film
producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, fuelling a rash
of similar disclosures under the #MeToo hashtag.

DANGERS
Bambi risks arrest, passersby taking photographs and lorries
blocking her walls to produce outdoor art but said she prefers
the ""democratising"" nature of the street to formal galleries.
""It's not pretentious at all, it's accessible...it's an
equaliser.""
Her most famous piece was defaced at a nearby spot; it had
shown U.S. President Donald Trump dancing with former British
Prime Minister Theresa May with the tagline 'Lie Lie Land' in a
pastiche of the blockbuster film 'La La Land.'
""If they don't last, they don't last - that's all part of
it,"" she said.
Her biggest hope is to make art that gives women a ""home""
and provokes debate about gender imbalances, she said.
""It's a big responsibility, being an artist - a female
artist,"" she said.  "" it's incredible.""

              <p>UNITED NATIONS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The fight for justice for
victims of Islamic State militants does not end with the death
of leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Nobel laureate Nadia Murad said

              <p>Murad, who won the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to
end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, is an Iraqi
Yazidi woman who was enslaved and raped by Islamic State
(ISIS)fighters in Mosul, Iraq, in 2014. Several of her brothers
were killed by Islamic State and their wives also held captive.</p>
              <p>Since 2010, Baghdadi led the jihadist group. U.S. President
Donald Trump announced on Sunday that Baghdadi killed himself by
detonating a suicide vest after fleeing into a dead-end tunnel

              <p>""At first I talked to my sisters-in-law,"" Murad told
reporters at the United Nations. ""Everyone was saying: 'OK, but
this is just Baghdadi, how about all these ISIS?'""</p>
              <p>""How about those that raped us? They sold us, they still

said.</p>
              <p>U.N. experts warned in June 2016 that Islamic State was
committing genocide against the Yazidis in Syria and Iraq to
destroy the minority religious community through killings,
sexual slavery and other crimes.</p>
              <p>Islamic State militants consider the Yazidis to be
devil-worshippers. The Yazidi faith has elements of
Christianity, Zoroastrianism and Islam.</p>
              <p>""There is thousands of ISIS, they joined al Baghdadi and
they continue to do what he did,"" Murad said. ""So it wasn't only
Baghdadi, we have to know there is thousands of ISIS like

              <p>""We want to see them in justice,"" she said.</p>
              <p>A U.N. investigative team, created by the U.N. Security

              <p>* Germany approaching 30th anniversary of Berlin Wall's fall</p>
              <p>By Tanja Daube and Michelle Martin</p>
              <p>BERLIN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - When Hans Schulze was imprisoned
in Communist East Germany back in the 1980s, he never thought
he'd ever return once he got out. But now he regularly unlocks
his old cell door to show tourists what life was like in a jail
run by the Stasi secret police.</p>
              <p>A West German responsible for his chemical company's
business in the East, Schulze was on his way to a trade fair in
the East German city of Leipzig in 1986 when he stopped at a
motorway service station and met a woman by chance.</p>
              <p>Schulze, now 66, was fascinated by the well-dressed woman
and they began a relationship. The East-West dimension of their
liaison gave Schulze a thrill, but to this day he does not know
for sure whether she loved him or was just using him.</p>
              <p>""I didn't know that she was an unofficial Stasi informant,""
said Schulze, who gives tours of Hohenschoenhausen prison, where
he spent some of his 13 months behind bars three decades ago, in
eastern Berlin.</p>
              <p>""It was only later, when the accusation of spying was
raised, that everything appeared in a different light.""</p>
              <p>Such themes of temptation, duplicity and betrayal that
marked Cold War-era espionage have come back into focus in the
run-up to the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall on
Nov. 9 that brought about German reunification.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>""ROMEO SPIES""</p>
              <p>Schulze found out some time after he became romantically
involved with the woman that her husband - from whom she was
separated - worked for the Stasi, but he did not grasp the full
extent until the media reported on her Stasi files in 2009.</p>
              <p>Under its foreign intelligence chief Markus Wolf, the Stasi
perfected the use of ""Romeo spies"" - agents who used their
personal charms as well as their wiles to ensnare Western
sources of valuable intelligence.</p>
              <p>Unbeknown to Schulze, his lover had been tasked by the Stasi
with picking up solo travellers and business people from the
West. She told him she wanted to flee to the West and Schulze
still isn't sure whether that was her personal desire or whether
the Stasi wanted her to continue working for them in the West.</p>
              <p>Three years before the fall of the Wall, Schulze was
arrested at the border as he tried to leave the East. A letter
the woman had written about her husband's work was found in his
car, as was some money she wanted Schulze to take to the West.</p>
              <p>Schulze was accused of spying and a day later his lover was
arrested, though he is not sure what the charge against her was.</p>
              <p>East German authorities ultimately withdrew accusations of
spying, subversive human trafficking and betraying state secrets
- which would have triggered a long prison term - and he was
ultimately sentenced to 2-1/2 years in prison for currency
crimes and helping prepare an illegal border crossing.</p>
              <p>""I can tell you it really hits you hard. You have to absorb
it first,"" he said of the emotional manipulation. ""And I know
now that they did it on purpose - that's what I accuse them of.""</p>
              <p>Schulze thinks his status as a West German meant he was
probably treated better than others at Hohenschoenhausen, where
physical violence was widely used in the 1950s before
psychological interrogation methods took over.</p>
              <p>He was transferred to another prison before his release in
October 1987. His lover, who had spent her imprisonment working
in the kitchen at Hohenschoenhausen, was freed a month later.</p>
              <p>They saw each other in prison but Schulze said their
relationship ended around the time they were released, and after
reunification in 1990 she became a car saleswoman and hotel
director in the West.</p>
              <p>It was initially hard for Schulze to return to the prison

* Germany approaching 30th anniversary of Berlin Wall's fall
By Tanja Daube and Michelle Martin
BERLIN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - When Hans Schulze was imprisoned
in Communist East Germany back in the 1980s, he never thought
he'd ever return once he got out. But now he regularly unlocks
his old cell door to show tourists what life was like in a jail
run by the Stasi secret police.
A West German responsible for his chemical company's
business in the East, Schulze was on his way to a trade fair in
the East German city of Leipzig in 1986 when he stopped at a
motorway service station and met a woman by chance.
Schulze, now 66, was fascinated by the well-dressed woman
and they began a relationship. The East-West dimension of their
liaison gave Schulze a thrill, but to this day he does not know
for sure whether she loved him or was just using him.
""I didn't know that she was an unofficial Stasi informant,""
said Schulze, who gives tours of Hohenschoenhausen prison, where
he spent some of his 13 months behind bars three decades ago, in
eastern Berlin.
""It was only later, when the accusation of spying was
raised, that everything appeared in a different light.""
Such themes of temptation, duplicity and betrayal that
marked Cold War-era espionage have come back into focus in the
run-up to the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall on
Nov. 9 that brought about German reunification.

""ROMEO SPIES""
Schulze found out some time after he became romantically
involved with the woman that her husband - from whom she was
separated - worked for the Stasi, but he did not grasp the full
extent until the media reported on her Stasi files in 2009.
Under its foreign intelligence chief Markus Wolf, the Stasi
perfected the use of ""Romeo spies"" - agents who used their
personal charms as well as their wiles to ensnare Western
sources of valuable intelligence.
Unbeknown to Schulze, his lover had been tasked by the Stasi
with picking up solo travellers and business people from the
West. She told him she wanted to flee to the West and Schulze
still isn't sure whether that was her personal desire or whether
the Stasi wanted her to continue working for them in the West.
Three years before the fall of the Wall, Schulze was
arrested at the border as he tried to leave the East. A letter
the woman had written about her husband's work was found in his
car, as was some money she wanted Schulze to take to the West.
Schulze was accused of spying and a day later his lover was
arrested, though he is not sure what the charge against her was.
East German authorities ultimately withdrew accusations of
spying, subversive human trafficking and betraying state secrets
- which would have triggered a long prison term - and he was
ultimately sentenced to 2-1/2 years in prison for currency
crimes and helping prepare an illegal border crossing.
""I can tell you it really hits you hard. You have to absorb
it first,"" he said of the emotional manipulation. ""And I know
now that they did it on purpose - that's what I accuse them of.""
Schulze thinks his status as a West German meant he was
probably treated better than others at Hohenschoenhausen, where
physical violence was widely used in the 1950s before
psychological interrogation methods took over.
He was transferred to another prison before his release in
October 1987. His lover, who had spent her imprisonment working
in the kitchen at Hohenschoenhausen, was freed a month later.
They saw each other in prison but Schulze said their
relationship ended around the time they were released, and after
reunification in 1990 she became a car saleswoman and hotel
director in the West.
It was initially hard for Schulze to return to the prison
followingr reunification but he wants to make sure that others -
including children born long after East Germany collapsed - know
what happened behind the prison's walls.
He now tells his story to some of the more than 455,000
people who visit Hohenschoenhausen every year. Thousands of
political prisoners were incarcerated in the prison, which has
since been turned into a museum and memorial.
""That period of time still affects me to this day and that's
why I give tours here now, to pass on the message,"" Schulze
said.

              <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A young
wrestler dubbed ""Little Miss Sumo"" is fighting sexism in the
ancient Japanese sport, hoping to inspire other women to step
into the ring and elevate sumo to Olympic status.</p>
              <p>Hiyori Kon is the focus of a new Netflix documentary ""Little
Miss Sumo"", which tracked her attempts to take on sporting
inequality in a society that lags on all manner of women's
rights.</p>
              <p>Popularly regarded as Japan's national sport, sumo pits two
giant wrestlers, clad only in loinclothes, in a test of brawn

KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A young
wrestler dubbed ""Little Miss Sumo"" is fighting sexism in the
ancient Japanese sport, hoping to inspire other women to step
into the ring and elevate sumo to Olympic status.
Hiyori Kon is the focus of a new Netflix documentary ""Little
Miss Sumo"", which tracked her attempts to take on sporting
inequality in a society that lags on all manner of women's
rights.
Popularly regarded as Japan's national sport, sumo pits two
giant wrestlers, clad only in loinclothes, in a test of brawn
and skill waged - with crouches and charges - inside a ring
floored with clay and edged with straw bales.
But tradition in a sport that began more than 1,500 years
ago forbids women from entering the ring as the space is sacred
and any female presence is considered a pollutant.
""Even if you are faced with someone who is big and strong -
it's not something to run away from, but engage with - like in
the sumo way,"" said 22-year-old Kon when asked how other wannabe
but wary women wrestlers should take up the sport.
""There are so many possibilities and things that sumo opens
up for you. It is just a wonderful sport,"" Kon, a sumo prodigy
and student at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, told the Thomson
Reuters Foundation by phone on Wednesday.
Conservative Japan lags far behind other big powers when it
comes to gender equality, ranking 110th of 149 countries in the
World Economic Forum's 2018 Global Gender Gap report.
Long work hours favour men, politics is male dominated,
incomes are unequal and tradition favours a wife working for
home and husband as her top job.
Be it intimate groping on packed trains, sexual violence in
manga or the glorification of geisha, women are subjected to
widespread sexual stereotyping.
Sport is no more immune - and none more so than sumo.
Last year the Japan Sumo Association, which does not let
women compete professionally, had to apologise when female
medics were asked to leave a sumo ring where they were treating
a local official who had collapsed.
The action of the referee reignited a debate about sumo's
ingrained sexism and drew sharp media criticism.
The rule that bars ""unclean"" women from the ring has also
prevented female politicians from handing out awards there.

SUMO-MAD
Most female wrestlers quit after elementary school, said
Kon, who was born in the sumo-mad prefecture of Aomori.
""I began practicing sumo when I was six,"" she said. ""All my
brothers and sisters took part and that's how I took an
interest.""
Kon rarely lost a match as a child new to the sport -
against boys and girls alike - and at university she became the
third woman to join the sumo club.
The trio was spotted by a filmmaker who was so intrigued by
their passion, he decided to document Kon's story.
""Of those three, maybe I looked the most sumo-like,"" said a
smiling Kon, who graduates in March.
""When I first saw them film, it surprised me how cool sumo
looks ... it (showed) the charm of sumo and it can become even
more popular. It really is my life ambition to make it an

Released globally on Netflix on Monday, ""Little Miss Sumo""
shows growing momentum in Japan for women's rights.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has promoted policies to raise the
status of women in a society that values traditional femininity.
Kon was one of two Japanese women listed this month as one
of the BBC's 100 most inspiring and influential women for 2019.
The other was Yumi Ishikawa, an actor and writer who won the

              <p>LONDON, Oct 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The deaths of
39 migrants found in a refrigerated truck in Britain has
reignited calls for efforts to tackle slavery in the nail bar
sector, a common destination for trafficked Vietnamese.</p>
              <p>Most of the people discovered in the truck are believed to
be from Vietnam, one of the top source countries for victims of
modern slavery in Britain - accounting for about 10% of 7,000
suspected slaves referred to the government for support in 2018.</p>
              <p>Police are still investigating the case and it is not yet
clear why the victims were travelling to Britain.</p>
              <p>But it is well documented that some Vietnamese - lured to
Europe by promises of lucrative jobs - end up exploited in
illegal cannabis farms and cheap nail bars which have
proliferated across the country.</p>
              <p>""It's an extreme tragedy and I think hopefully it will be a
catalyst for some sort of change,"" said Philippa Southwell, a
lawyer with Birds Solicitors who specialises in trafficking.</p>
              <p>""(We need) tighter regulation in various sectors such as
cash-in-hand nail bars and car washes where it is easy for
exploitation to take place,"" she said, adding that nail salons
were often used to launder proceeds from criminal activity.</p>
              <p>Although many nail bars set up by Britain's Vietnamese
community are legitimate, experts say traffickers have
piggy-backed off their success.</p>
              <p>Anti-slavery charity Unseen said labour exploitation at
beauty salons was the second biggest concern after carwashes for
callers to its hotline last year, with 477 potential victims.</p>
              <p>Britain's anti-slavery chief said on Tuesday that most
recommendations made by her office in 2017 on tackling the issue
- including regulation of nail bars - had not been implemented.</p>
              <p>Trafficking experts said the deaths, which were discovered
on Oct. 23, should be a ""clarion call"" for stronger action to
protect trafficking victims and called for tighter controls
including more labour inspections.</p>
              <p>Northern Irish truck driver Maurice Robinson appeared in
court on Monday accused of manslaughter, money laundering,
conspiracy to traffic people and conspiracy to assist unlawful
immigration.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>LOCKED UP</p>
              <p>In 2017, Britain's former anti-slavery commissioner Kevin
Hyland called for tighter regulation of nail bars in a report on
combating trafficking involving Vietnamese nationals.</p>
              <p>One victim quoted in his report worked seven days a week for
30 pounds ($40). Another had to give all his money to his
enslavers who locked him up between shifts.</p>
              <p>Hyland said Britain should look at New York which had
introduced controls on nail bars.</p>
              <p>His successor Sara Thornton said the majority of the
report's 35 recommendations had not been implemented.</p>
              <p>""Although we don't yet know the full details of this case,
it appears to bear the hallmarks of human trafficking,"" she told
the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p>""My office will be looking at what more can be done to
improve our response to this heinous crime and reviewing the
outstanding recommendations of this report will be an important
part of this.""</p>

              <p>The British Association of Beauty Therapy and Cosmetology

              <p>She said criminalisation prevented trafficking victims

              <p>Tell-tale indicators of exploitation in nail bars include
unfeasibly low prices, workers who appear very young or are

              <p>SHARYA CAMP, Iraq (Reuters) - Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's death will mean nothing to 19-year-old rape victim Jamila unless the Islamic State militants who enslaved her are brought to justice.</p>
              <p>Jamila, who asked not to be identified by her last name, is one of thousands of women from the Yazidi minority religion who were kidnapped and raped by IS after it mounted an assault on the Yazidi homeland in northern Iraq in August 2014.</p>
              <p>""Even if Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead, it doesn't mean Islamic State is dead,"" Jamila told Reuters outside the tent that is now her temporary home in the Sharya camp for displaced Yazidis in Iraq's Kurdistan Region. </p>
              <p>""This doesn't feel like justice yet,"" she said. ""I want the men who took me, who raped me, to stand trial. And I want to have my voice heard in court. I want to face them in court ... Without proper trials, his death has no meaning.""</p>
              <p>Baghdadi, who had led IS since 2010, detonated a suicide vest after being cornered in a raid by U.S. special forces in northwest Syria, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Inspired by his edicts to enslave and slaughter Yazidis, whom IS regard as infidels, his followers shot, beheaded and kidnapped thousands in a rampage which the United Nations called a genocidal campaign against them.</p>
              <p>Along with thousands of other women and children, Jamila said she was enslaved by the militants and kept in captivity for five months in the city of Mosul along with her sister. </p>
              <p>She was just 14 when she was seized. But her problems did not end after she and her sister managed to escape when, she said, their guards were high on drugs.</p>

SHARYA CAMP, Iraq (Reuters) - Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's death will mean nothing to 19-year-old rape victim Jamila unless the Islamic State militants who enslaved her are brought to justice.
Jamila, who asked not to be identified by her last name, is one of thousands of women from the Yazidi minority religion who were kidnapped and raped by IS after it mounted an assault on the Yazidi homeland in northern Iraq in August 2014.
""Even if Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead, it doesn't mean Islamic State is dead,"" Jamila told Reuters outside the tent that is now her temporary home in the Sharya camp for displaced Yazidis in Iraq's Kurdistan Region. 
""This doesn't feel like justice yet,"" she said. ""I want the men who took me, who raped me, to stand trial. And I want to have my voice heard in court. I want to face them in court ... Without proper trials, his death has no meaning.""
Baghdadi, who had led IS since 2010, detonated a suicide vest after being cornered in a raid by U.S. special forces in northwest Syria, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Sunday.
Inspired by his edicts to enslave and slaughter Yazidis, whom IS regard as infidels, his followers shot, beheaded and kidnapped thousands in a rampage which the United Nations called a genocidal campaign against them.
Along with thousands of other women and children, Jamila said she was enslaved by the militants and kept in captivity for five months in the city of Mosul along with her sister. 
She was just 14 when she was seized. But her problems did not end after she and her sister managed to escape when, she said, their guards were high on drugs.
""When I first came back, I had a nervous breakdown and psychological problems for two years, so I couldn't go to school,"" she said.
Now instead of working or catching up on her years of lost schooling, she looks after her mother, with whom she shares her cramped tent at the camp. 
""My mother can't walk and has health problems so I have to stay and take care of her because my older siblings are in Germany,"" she said.

NO PLANS TO GO HOME
The prospect of going home to Sinjar in northern Iraq is not an option for Jamila, and many others. The city still lies in ruin four years after the IS onslaught, and suspicion runs deep in the ethnically mixed area.
""Sinjar is completely destroyed. Even if we could go back, I wouldn't want to because we'd be surrounded by the same Arab neighbors who all joined IS in the first place, and helped them kill us (Yazidis),"" she said. 
Thousands of men are being tried in Iraqi courts for their ties to IS. Iraq has so far not allowed victims to testify in court, something community leaders and human rights groups say would go a long way in the healing process.
""It is deplorable that not a single victim of Islamic State's horrific abuses including sexual slavery has gotten their day in court,"" said Belkis Wille, Iraq Researcher for Human Rights Watch. ""Iraq's justice system is designed to allow the state to exact mass revenge against suspects, not provide real accountability for victims.""
For some of the nearly 17,000 Yazidis at the Sharya camp, Baghdadi's death was a first step in that direction though they fear the IS fighters who are still alive.
Mayan Sinu, 25, can dream of a new life after the camp as she and her three children have been granted asylum by Australia. But she also wants the men who shot her husband in the legs and dragged him off to be brought to justice. He has been missing since the incident five years ago.

              <p>BOBIYA, India, Oct 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When
half a dozen trucks loaded with construction material screeched
to a halt on their farms, Baryam Singh and fellow residents in
the Indian village of Bobiya sensed they were soon going to lose
more land to the military.</p>
              <p>The farmers chased away the contractors and labourers with
protests and threats of deflated tyres, knowing it was only a
temporary reprieve.</p>
              <p>""The military infrastructure has been growing in our village
and our farmlands are shrinking,"" Singh told the Thomson Reuters
Foundation, as other farmers sitting around him nodded.</p>
              <p>""More than 50% of our agricultural land is under military
lockdown,"" he said of the village on the border with Pakistan.</p>
              <p>Over the past 15 years, the Indian army and the country's
Border Security Force (BSF) have been acquiring land to fortify
defences in the border districts of Jammu and Kashmir, according
to the Border Welfare Committee, a local organisation
campaigning for the rights of border residents.</p>
              <p>Both India and Pakistan administer the disputed state of
Kashmir in part while claiming it in full.</p>
              <p>The fertile land where Jammu and Kashmir meets Pakistan has
become dotted with barbed wire and landmines, leaving hundreds
of farmers cut off from their farms, often with no warning or
compensation, said Bobiya villagers.</p>
              <p>""This is adding to the economic distress of farmers who
don't have alternative sources of livelihood,"" said Singh.</p>
              <p>After India revoked the autonomy of its portion of Kashmir
in August, farmers in border areas now fear losing even more of
their land to the military, according to ID Khajuria, an
activist who heads up the Jammu and Kashmir Forum for Peace and
Territorial Integrity.</p>
              <p>With India bringing Jammu and Kashmir deeper into its fold,
the central government will have greater power to seize
territory in the border regions in the name of national
security, he warned.</p>
              <p>""The local elected political representatives will now have a
very limited say in the functioning of the (Jammu and Kashmir)
government,"" Khajuria said.</p>
              <p>Jammu divisional commissioner Sanjeev Verma said that all
farmers in Jammu province would eventually be paid for their
land.</p>
              <p>""Whatever new agricultural land is being acquired, the
farmers will get financial compensation,"" he said in a phone
interview.</p>
              <p>Some have already been compensated, he added, though he
declined to specify how many.</p>
              <p>'I AM LANDLESS NOW'</p>
              <p>The defence system includes a fence of about 900 km (560
miles) in length that sits several kilometres into India from
the border, slicing through villages and leaving vast tracts of
farmland on the other side of the fence towards Pakistan.</p>
              <p>India's government is also working on a ""Wall of Defence""
along the border between India and Pakistan, according to the
Border Security Force.</p>
              <p>The project consists of a 10-metre-high (32-foot) mud
embankment to protect residents of India's border villages from
frequent ceasefire violations that both sides blame on each
other.</p>
              <p>There are also plans to install high-tech surveillance
systems to plug gaps where physical surveillance is not
possible, India's ministry of home affairs announced last year.</p>
              <p>Members of the Border Welfare Committee - which is based in
the city of K    athua - said that thousands of hectares of
Indian farmland now sit untouched on the other side of the
fence.</p>
              <p>Technically, farmers can still get to their land, but the
checkpoints in the fence are opened only during specific times
of day and farmers have to walk for hours to reach their fields,
explained Bharat Bhushan Sharma, the committee's vice president.</p>
              <p>Even if they do manage to successfully cultivate their
crops, ""there is always a threat of cross-border fire"", said
Sharma, who is also head of Bobiya village.</p>
              <p>""And then (they) can't protect their crops from wild
animals.""</p>
              <p>Committee president Nanak Chand, 87, said he lost almost
eight hectares of land to the fence when it was first built in
2004.</p>
              <p>""Three months ago, the military acquired the remaining two
hectares of farmland as well,"" he said. ""I am landless now.""</p>
              <p>Chand was given 3 million rupees ($42,000) as compensation,
which he says is not enough to buy himself an equivalent piece
of land in a peaceful part of the country.</p>
              <p>Khajuria agreed, saying that ""with developers and
businessmen from other states rushing to Jammu and Kashmir, land
prices are likely to soar and it would make it difficult for
poor border residents to buy land in peaceful areas.""</p>
              <p>In December 2018, Chand filed a petition with the Jammu and
Kashmir High Court on behalf of farmers living in the border
areas of the affected districts.</p>
              <p>The petition called for the government to pay rent for
farmland on the Pakistan side of the fence and provide farmers
with compensation for each crop season during which their land
remains uncultivated.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Home Affairs, the BSF and the local
administration have not yet filed their responses, according to
lawyers representing the farmers.</p>
              <p>Jugal Kishore Sharma, a member of the ruling Bharatiya
Janata Party who represents the Jammu-Poonch parliamentary
constituency, could not specify how much of the land along the
border currently being used by the military is farmland.</p>
              <p>But he said officials in the border districts are in the
process of measuring that amount.</p>
              <p>""Thereafter, the government will start paying rent to
farmers,"" he said in a phone interview.</p>
              <p>WAITING FOR PEACE</p>
              <p>Often times, when the border fence cuts through a farm, it
also isolates the village in which the farm is located, said
Mohammad Arif Khan, 67, head of Behrooti village in Poonch
district.</p>
              <p>As a result, ""the villages (are) deprived of even the basic
facilities and infrastructure,"" he explained.</p>
              <p>The huge razor-wire fence has turned Behrooti into what
locals have described as an open prison.</p>
              <p>""Our village doesn't have roads and healthcare facilities.

Mohammad Nisar Khan, 30, another resident.</p>
              <p>""A zoo is visited by people every day, but here the
outsiders are not allowed. Socially, we are completely
isolated.""</p>
              <p>The knowledge that the military plans to add high-tech

who like many Indians living on the border is holding out hope
that the fence will one day be moved onto the border itself.</p>
              <p>""We'll become permanent prisoners if the fence gets upgraded
at its current location,"" he said.</p>
              <p>While the residents of Behrooti feel trapped in their

their homes for good.</p>
              <p>""There's little chance that our next generation will be in a

              <p>LONDON, Oct 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - American
singer-songwriter John Legend has revamped the 75-year-old
classic ""Baby It's Cold Outside"" for the #MeToo era, after it
was banned last year as critics said it encouraged date rape.</p>
              <p>The new rendition of the catchy song about a man coaxing a
woman to stay with him includes the lyrics ""It's your body, and
your choice"", said Legend, who recorded the duet with ""American
Idol"" singer Kelly Clarkson for his latest Christmas album.</p>
              <p>An Ohio radio station took the original - sung by such big
names as Dean Martin and Dolly Parton - out of its list of
holiday music in 2018 due to its controversial lyrics, amid
rising awareness about sexual coercion and abuse.</p>
              <p>Lines in the 1944 version, such as the woman asking ""Say,
what's in this drink?"" and the man saying ""Baby don't hold out"",
have led to it being dubbed a date rape anthem.</p>
              <p>In the new recording, Clarkson sings, ""What will my friends
think..."", with Legend responding, ""I think they should rejoice""
/ ""...if I have one more drink?"" / ""It's your body and your
choice"", Legend told Vanity Fair magazine.</p>
              <p>The latest rendition by Legend and Clarkson, co-hosts on the
popular TV show ""The Voice"", features on the deluxe edition of
Legend's previously released album, ""A Legendary Christmas"",
which is due out for the holiday season.</p>
              <p>Legend is a well-known social justice campaigner, along with
his model wife Chrissy Teigen, who have both come under fire
from U.S. President Donald Trump for speaking out in favour of
criminal justice reform.</p>
              <p>This month marks two years since the #MeToo movement
exploded on social media after accusations of sexual abuse were
made public against Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein. He
denies any non-consensual sex.</p>
              <p>More victims of sexual assault have since come forward to
speak out against dozens of powerful men, ending the careers of
celebrities like opera singer Placido Domingo and comedian Bill

              <p>In the cover story interview, Legend also discussed his role
in ""Surviving R. Kelly"", a documentary which includes
allegations from multiple women who accuse the Grammy

              <p>By Raya Jalabi</p>
              <p>SHARYA CAMP, Iraq, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Islamic State leader
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's death will mean nothing to 19-year-old
rape victim Jamila unless the Islamic State militants who
enslaved her are brought to justice.</p>
              <p>Jamila, who asked not to be identified by her last name, is
one of thousands of women from the Yazidi minority religion who
were kidnapped and raped by IS after it mounted an assault on
the Yazidi homeland in northern Iraq in August 2014.</p>
              <p>""Even if Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead, it doesn't mean
Islamic State is dead,"" Jamila told Reuters outside the tent
that is now her temporary home in the Sharya camp for displaced
Yazidis in Iraq's Kurdistan Region.</p>
              <p>""This doesn't feel like justice yet,"" she said. ""I want the
men who took me, who raped me, to stand trial. And I want to
have my voice heard in court. I want to face them in court ...
Without proper trials, his death has no meaning.""</p>
              <p>Baghdadi, who had led IS since 2010, detonated a suicide
vest after being cornered in a raid by U.S. special forces in
northwest Syria, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on
Sunday.</p>
              <p>Inspired by his edicts to enslave and slaughter Yazidis,
whom IS regard as infidels, his followers shot, beheaded and
kidnapped thousands in a rampage which the United Nations called
a genocidal campaign against them.</p>
              <p>Along with thousands of other women and children, Jamila
said she was enslaved by the militants and kept in captivity for
five months in the city of Mosul along with her sister.</p>
              <p>She was just 14 when she was seized. But her problems did
not end after she and her sister managed to escape when, she
said, their guards were high on drugs.</p>
              <p>""When I first came back, I had a nervous breakdown and
psychological problems for two years, so I couldn't go to
school,"" she said.</p>
              <p>Now instead of working or catching up on her years of lost
schooling, she looks after her mother, with whom she shares her
cramped tent at the camp.</p>
              <p>""My mother can't walk and has health problems so I have to
stay and take care of her because my older siblings are in
Germany,"" she said.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>NO PLANS TO GO HOME</p>
              <p>The prospect of going home to Sinjar in northern Iraq is not
an option for Jamila, and many others. The city still lies in
ruin four years after the IS onslaught, and suspicion runs deep
in the ethnically mixed area.</p>
              <p>""Sinjar is completely destroyed. Even if we could go back, I
wouldn't want to because we'd be surrounded by the same Arab
neighbours who all joined IS in the first place, and helped them
kill us (Yazidis),"" she said.</p>
              <p>Thousands of men are being tried in Iraqi courts for their
ties to IS. Iraq has so far not allowed victims to testify in
court, something community leaders and human rights groups say
would go a long way in the healing process.</p>
              <p>""It is deplorable that not a single victim of Islamic
State's horrific abuses including sexual slavery has gotten
their day in court,"" said Belkis Wille, Iraq Researcher for
Human Rights Watch. ""Iraq's justice system is designed to allow

By Raya Jalabi
SHARYA CAMP, Iraq, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Islamic State leader
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's death will mean nothing to 19-year-old
rape victim Jamila unless the Islamic State militants who
enslaved her are brought to justice.
Jamila, who asked not to be identified by her last name, is
one of thousands of women from the Yazidi minority religion who
were kidnapped and raped by IS after it mounted an assault on
the Yazidi homeland in northern Iraq in August 2014.
""Even if Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead, it doesn't mean
Islamic State is dead,"" Jamila told Reuters outside the tent
that is now her temporary home in the Sharya camp for displaced
Yazidis in Iraq's Kurdistan Region.
""This doesn't feel like justice yet,"" she said. ""I want the
men who took me, who raped me, to stand trial. And I want to
have my voice heard in court. I want to face them in court ...
Without proper trials, his death has no meaning.""
Baghdadi, who had led IS since 2010, detonated a suicide
vest after being cornered in a raid by U.S. special forces in
northwest Syria, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on
Sunday.
Inspired by his edicts to enslave and slaughter Yazidis,
whom IS regard as infidels, his followers shot, beheaded and
kidnapped thousands in a rampage which the United Nations called
a genocidal campaign against them.
Along with thousands of other women and children, Jamila
said she was enslaved by the militants and kept in captivity for
five months in the city of Mosul along with her sister.
She was just 14 when she was seized. But her problems did
not end after she and her sister managed to escape when, she
said, their guards were high on drugs.
""When I first came back, I had a nervous breakdown and
psychological problems for two years, so I couldn't go to
school,"" she said.
Now instead of working or catching up on her years of lost
schooling, she looks after her mother, with whom she shares her
cramped tent at the camp.
""My mother can't walk and has health problems so I have to
stay and take care of her because my older siblings are in
Germany,"" she said.

NO PLANS TO GO HOME
The prospect of going home to Sinjar in northern Iraq is not
an option for Jamila, and many others. The city still lies in
ruin four years after the IS onslaught, and suspicion runs deep
in the ethnically mixed area.
""Sinjar is completely destroyed. Even if we could go back, I
wouldn't want to because we'd be surrounded by the same Arab
neighbours who all joined IS in the first place, and helped them
kill us (Yazidis),"" she said.
Thousands of men are being tried in Iraqi courts for their
ties to IS. Iraq has so far not allowed victims to testify in
court, something community leaders and human rights groups say
would go a long way in the healing process.
""It is deplorable that not a single victim of Islamic
State's horrific abuses including sexual slavery has gotten
their day in court,"" said Belkis Wille, Iraq Researcher for
Human Rights Watch. ""Iraq's justice system is designed to allow
the state to exact mass revenge against suspects, not provide
real accountability for victims.""
For some of the nearly 17,000 Yazidis at the Sharya camp,
Baghdadi's death was a first step in that direction though they
fear the IS fighters who are still alive.
Mayan Sinu, 25, can dream of a new life after the camp as
she and her three children have been granted asylum by
Australia. But she also wants the men who shot her husband in
the legs and dragged him off to be brought to justice. He has
been missing since the incident five years ago.
""I hope Baghdadi is suffering more than we ever did, and my
God we suffered,"" said Sinu. ""I wish he (Baghdadi) hadn't blown
himself up so I could have slaughtered him myself with my bare
hands.""

LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - British police were hunting on
Tuesday for two brothers from Northern Ireland whom they
described as ""crucial"" to an investigation into the deaths of 39
people found in the back of a truck near London last week.
The discovery of the bodies in a refrigerated truck on an
industrial estate near London has shone a spotlight on the
illicit trade that sends the poor of Asia, Africa and the Middle

The 39 victims - 31 men and eight women - have yet to be
identified but Vietnam said it was trying to accelerate the
process. It fears many of the dead were its citizens.
The bodies were found in the early hours of Oct. 23 after
the container arrived in Britain from Zeebrugge in Belgium. The
container was picked up at Purfleet dock, to the east of London,
by a truck allegedly driven by Maurice Robinson, who is from
Northern Ireland.
On Monday, Robinson, 25, appeared in court accused of
manslaughter, money laundering, conspiracy to traffic people and
conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration.
For the two latter alleged offences, the charge sheet stated
he had conspired with Ronan Hughes and others, prosecutors said.
Police leading the investigation said Hughes, 40, and his
brother Christopher, 34, from Armagh, were also wanted on
suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking.
""Finding and speaking to the Hughes brothers is crucial to

LONDON, Oct 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The discovery
of 39 bodies in a truck in London last week cast a spotlight on
the global trade in human beings and sparked debate about
Britain's approach to tackling smugglers and traffickers.
A British court heard on Monday that a global crime ring had
been involved in smuggling the dead - many of whom appear to
have come from Vietnam - as the driver of the truck faced
charges of manslaughter and human trafficking.
Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on Saturday told
authorities to establish whether Vietnamese citizens were among
the dead, and to probe allegations of trafficking.
Unlike trafficking, which is control over a person for the
purpose of exploitation, smuggling is merely illegal entry into
another country - although the latter can turn into the former.
About 10% of the suspected 7,000 slavery victims found in
Britain last year were Vietnamese. Most are trafficked for
labour such as cannabis cultivation and work in nail salons.
Globally, more than 40 million people are estimated by the
United Nations to be trapped in modern slavery as poverty,
conflict and climate change fuel the $150-billion-a-year trade.
The Thomson Reuters Foundation asked six anti-slavery
experts about how to prevent such deaths from happening again.

MIDDLETOWN, Va., Oct 29 (Reuters) - Sporting a Confederate
flag shirt near a field clouded by cannon smoke, where blue- and
gray-clad soldiers reenacted a Civil War battle from 155 years
ago, Larry Caldwell Piercy, Jr. said he sees a new war looming
in the United States - and a role for himself in any fighting.
""It would be all guerrilla warfare, not this open
field-style kind of thing,"" he said, gesturing at the
reenactment of the 1864 Battle of Cedar Creek in Middletown,
Virginia, earlier this month. ""I would probably be an officer in
that effort.""
Piercy, 62, is one of the motorcycle riders known as the
""mechanized cavalry"" of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, which
has an estimated 30,000 members and describes itself as a
""non-political heritage organization"" that preserves the history
and legacy of soldiers in the pro-slavery Confederacy in the
1861-1865 Civil War.
He is also a fierce supporter of President Donald Trump.
As Democrats push to impeach Trump and controversy rages
over whether to remove monuments to Confederate generals like
Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, Piercy warned a new civil
war is brewing.
""You look into rural areas, and we're not seen, but there's
a lot of us that'll come out of these hills if it keeps getting
worse. Probably every Sons of Confederate Veterans member out

The Sons of Confederate Veterans, which limits membership to
men with Civil War veteran ancestors, is not seeking to secede
from the nation or to revive slavery, both Southern causes in
the 1861-1865 Civil War. But they say they are trying to
preserve the honor of the Confederacy by celebrating its flag,
monuments, and other symbols that are widely criticized as
tributes to institutional racism.
""#CivilWar2"" trended on Twitter in September after Trump
quoted a pastor in a Twitter post saying it would ""cause a Civil
War like fracture"" in the United States if he were removed from
office.
The next day, the right-wing Oath Keepers militia affirmed
Trump's tweet in its own Twitter post: ""This is the truth. This

POLITICAL VIOLENCE
While there is no evidence that radical groups on the right
or left are organizing a military campaign to plunge the country
into civil war, a number of attacks in recent years have raised
concerns about a surge in political violence.
A woman was killed when a white nationalist plowed his car
into a crowd of counter-protesters at a rally of right-wing
extremists in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.
In August, a suspected white nationalist shot dead 22 people
at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, shortly after posting an
anti-Hispanic manifesto online.
Violent rhetoric about an impending civil war is on the

VINH, Vietnam, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Vietnam is trying to speed
up the identification of its citizens who are suspected to have
been among the people found dead in the back of a truck near
London last week, Deputy Foreign Minister Nguyen Quoc Cuong told
Reuters on Tuesday.
A UK court heard on Monday that a global ring had been
involved in smuggling the group. The truck's driver is facing
charges of manslaughter and people trafficking.
""The nationality of the victims hasn't been officially
confirmed yet,"" Cuong said on the sidelines of a conference in
the northern-central town of Vinh.
Vietnam and Britain ""are trying to speed up identification
of the bodies, but no deadline has been set,"" he said.
On Monday, Vietnam's government said British police had sent
documents regarding four of the victims to Hanoi for further
verification.
The discovery of the bodies last week on an industrial
estate near London has shone a spotlight on the illicit trade
that sends the poor of Asia, Africa and the Middle East on
perilous journeys to the West
In Vietnam, poor job prospects, encouragement by
authorities, smuggling gangs, environmental disasters and
government pressure on Catholics are all local factors behind
the wave of migrants.
The desire to go overseas has created a thriving underground
market in the Southeast Asian country for people smugglers, many
of whom promise safe and even ""VIP"" packages for secret travel
to Europe, anti-trafficking experts, migrants and their family
members have told Reuters.
News of the tragedy has plunged the rural provinces of Nghe
An and Ha Tinh in northern-central Vietnam into despair, with
many families fearing loved ones may be among the dead.
Authorities in Nghe An have launched an appeal for concerned
family members to submit copies of photos and identification of
the missing to their local People's Committee for verification,
according to a copy of the appeal seen by Reuters.
Vietnam's foreign ministry has so far received information
from 14 concerned families seeking missing family members in the
UK, the ministry said in a statement late on Monday.
Communist-ruled Vietnam is extremely sensitive to events
which could lead to social unrest or public gatherings.
A candlelit ceremony outside a Catholic cathedral in Hanoi
in memory of the 39 victims was broken up by police on Sunday,
organisers said.
The propaganda department of Vietnam's ruling Communist
Party has instructed local media chiefs not to report or
speculate on the nationality or identity of the victims without
confirmation from Hanoi's foreign ministry, according to a copy
of the instruction seen by Reuters.
""Please be considerate and cautious,"" the instruction said.

Tuesday rejected a media report that the two governments were

              <p>Kyodo news reported on Monday that South Korea and Japan

funds in line with its position that claims over forced labour
were settled in a 1965 treaty.</p>

President Moon Jae-in given to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe last week.</p>
              <p>South Korea and Japan's bilateral relations have recently
deteriorated to some of its worst in decades over a bitter
history that includes the 1910-45 Japanese colonisation of the
Korean peninsula, the forced mobilisation of labour at Japanese
companies and the use of ""comfort women"" - Japan's euphemism for
girls and women, many of them Korean - forced to work in
military brothels.</p>

Tuesday rejected a media report that the two governments were
studying plans for a joint economic programme that aims to ease
strains over the issue of forced Korean labour in World War Two.
Kyodo news reported on Monday that South Korea and Japan
were considering a programme involving companies from both
countries, but that the Japanese government would not provide
funds in line with its position that claims over forced labour
were settled in a 1965 treaty.
Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said that the
report was not true. South Korea's foreign ministry also said in
a statement it was ""not true"".
""While respecting judicial judgment, the (South Korean)
government is open to finding reasonable ways that can be
accepted by victims and the people of both countries, and
continues to communicate with the Japanese diplomatic
authorities,"" the South Korean statement said.
Suga declined comment on whether such an idea for a
programme might have been in a letter from South Korean
President Moon Jae-in given to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe last week.
South Korea and Japan's bilateral relations have recently
deteriorated to some of its worst in decades over a bitter
history that includes the 1910-45 Japanese colonisation of the
Korean peninsula, the forced mobilisation of labour at Japanese
companies and the use of ""comfort women"" - Japan's euphemism for
girls and women, many of them Korean - forced to work in
military brothels.

CHELMSFORD, England (Reuters) - A court heard on Monday that a global ring had been involved in smuggling the 39 people whose bodies were found in a truck near London, as the driver faced charges of manslaughter and people-trafficking.
The discovery of the bodies last week in a refrigerated truck on an industrial estate near London has shone a spotlight on the illicit trade that sends the poor of Asia, Africa and the Middle East on perilous journeys to the West.
The truck's driver, Maurice Robinson, appeared in Chelmsford Magistrates' Court via video link. The 25-year-old, wearing a gray sweatshirt, spoke only to confirm his name, address and British nationality. 
Robinson faces 43 charges in all - 39 counts of manslaughter as well as accusations of conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration, and money laundering.
""This involves a global ring facilitating the movement of a large number of immigrants into the UK,"" prosecution lawyer Ogheneruona Mercy Iguyovwe told the court. She said other suspects were still being sought. 
Robinson did not apply for bail. He was remanded in custody until Nov. 25, when the case will continue at the Old Bailey, London's Central Criminal Court, and he will enter a plea.
He was arrested shortly after the bodies were found near the English port of Purfleet. The shipping container they were in had traveled from Zeebrugge in Belgium.

'HOPING FOR A BETTER LIFE'
""The whole nation and indeed the world has been shocked by this tragedy, and the cruelty of the fate that has been suffered by innocent people who were hoping for a better life in this country,"" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wrote in a book of condolences.
Interior minister Priti Patel told parliament the investigation would unravel ""criminality that could stretch half way across the world"".  
Many of the dead appear to have come from Vietnam's northern rice-growing areas of Nghe An and Ha Tinh, two of its poorest provinces.
""If I could travel back in time, I wouldn't have let him go this way,"" said Hoang Thi Ai, mother of Hoang Van Tiep, 18, who is feared to be among the dead. ""I clean his room every day with the hope that he wasn't in that deadly truck.""
Police have said few of the victims were carrying official identification, and that they are resorting to fingerprints, dental records, DNA and photographs from friends and relatives.
Vietnam said Britain had sent dossiers seeking help in identifying four of the bodies.
Deputy Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son said Vietnam was still unable to confirm the nationality of any of the victims.

'MY CHILD WAS SCAMMED'
Bui Thi Nhung, 19, is believed by her family to be one of the dead.
They said she had left Nghe An in August, making her way from China to Germany, then Belgium, where they believe she entered the container.
About 70 percent of Vietnamese trafficking cases in Britain between 2009 and 2016 were for labor exploitation, including cannabis production and work in nail salons, Britain said last year.

CHELMSFORD, England (Reuters) - A court heard on Monday that a global ring had been involved in smuggling the 39 people whose bodies were found in a truck near London, as the driver faced charges of manslaughter and people-trafficking.
The discovery of the bodies last week in a refrigerated truck on an industrial estate near London has shone a spotlight on the illicit trade that sends the poor of Asia, Africa and the Middle East on perilous journeys to the West.
The truck's driver, Maurice Robinson, appeared in Chelmsford Magistrates' Court via video link. The 25-year-old, wearing a grey sweatshirt, spoke only to confirm his name, address and British nationality. 
Robinson faces 43 charges in all - 39 counts of manslaughter as well as accusations of conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration, and money laundering.
""This involves a global ring facilitating the movement of a large number of immigrants into the UK,"" prosecution lawyer Ogheneruona Mercy Iguyovwe told the court. She said other suspects were still being sought. 
Robinson did not apply for bail. He was remanded in custody until Nov. 25, when the case will continue at the Old Bailey, London's Central Criminal Court, and he will enter a plea.
He was arrested shortly after the bodies were found near the English port of Purfleet. The shipping container they were in had travelled from Zeebrugge in Belgium.

'HOPING FOR A BETTER LIFE'
""The whole nation and indeed the world has been shocked by this tragedy, and the cruelty of the fate that has been suffered by innocent people who were hoping for a better life in this country,"" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wrote in a book of condolences.
Interior minister Priti Patel told parliament the investigation would unravel ""criminality that could stretch half way across the world"".  
Many of the dead appear to have come from Vietnam's northern rice-growing areas of Nghe An and Ha Tinh, two of its poorest provinces.
""If I could travel back in time, I wouldn't have let him go this way,"" said Hoang Thi Ai, mother of Hoang Van Tiep, 18, who is feared to be among the dead. ""I clean his room every day with the hope that he wasn't in that deadly truck.""
Police have said few of the victims were carrying official identification, and that they are resorting to fingerprints, dental records, DNA and photographs from friends and relatives.
Vietnam said Britain had sent dossiers seeking help in identifying four of the bodies.
Deputy Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son said Vietnam was still unable to confirm the nationality of any of the victims.

'MY CHILD WAS SCAMMED'
Bui Thi Nhung, 19, is believed by her family to be one of the dead.
They said she had left Nghe An in August, making her way from China to Germany, then Belgium, where they believe she entered the container.
About 70 percent of Vietnamese trafficking cases in Britain between 2009 and 2016 were for labour exploitation, including cannabis production and work in nail salons, Britain said last year.
A report last March by the Pacific Links Foundation, a U.S.-based anti-trafficking organisation, identified Nghe An as home to many victims of human trafficking who end up in Europe.
The other province, Ha Tinh, was ravaged in 2016 by one of Vietnam's worst environmental disasters when a steel mill owned by Taiwan's Formosa Plastics contaminated coastal waters, devastating fishing and tourism.
Tiep's mother said she believed her son had been tricked into travelling to Britain, since he had made it to France when he was 16 and settled down.    
""One day he hastily asked us to raise 100 million dong ($4,300) for his trip,"" Ai said, sitting with family members in their house in Dien Chau district of Nghe An province.

              <p>LAMU, Kenya, Oct 28 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Fishing
communities on Kenya's north coast will be the first to benefit
from ""smart"" identity cards aimed at distinguishing genuine
fishermen and loggers from poachers who raid waters and cut down
mangroves vital to ease climate change threats.</p>
              <p>Each government-issued Mvuvi card - the word means ""fisher""
in Swahili - features a photo and fingerprint taken from its

              <p>Authorities will be able to read the cards using smartphones
loaded with communications software that allows short-range
wireless data transfers.</p>
              <p>Officials hope the cards, being used first in Lamu County,
home to what the government says are about 60% of Kenya's
protected mangrove forests, will boost security and curb illegal
fishing and logging.</p>
              <p>""There are people who pretend to be fishermen going out to
sea but they are doing illegal logging of the mangroves,"" Samson

              <p>""Over-harvesting of mangroves will affect (impacts from)
climate change and ecosystems all along the shores of the coast

              <p>Environmental scientists have long stressed the important
role mangrove forests play in reducing global warming threats.</p>
              <p>Mangroves are far more effective at absorbing and storing
carbon dioxide - one of the major drivers of climate change -
than trees on land, they say.</p>
              <p>The trees' roots also trap and hold sediment, providing a
coastal buffer against storms and protection from floods, as
well as creating an important fish breeding ground.</p>
              <p>More than 35% of the world's mangroves are already gone and
they are disappearing three to five times faster than other
forests, according to international conservation group WWF.</p>
              <p>Figures published by Kenya's Ministry of Environment and
Forestry show that the country lost about 20% of its mangroves
between 1985 and 2009.</p>
              <p>Of the mangroves that remain, an estimated 40% are degraded.</p>
              <p>""In the mangroves, we have witnessed 'die-back', which is
mangroves just drying up,"" said John Bett, who works on
sustainable forestry for WWF-Kenya.</p>
              <p>Bett said he has seen the effects of climate change in Lamu

fall from trees onto the mud, has ""slowed down dramatically"".</p>

SALTIER LAND, EMPTIER SEAS
Coastal communities in Kenya are already struggling with the
effects of climate change.
Globally, scientists have warned that water temperatures are
increasing far faster than expected due to carbon emissions.
As oceans warm, they expand, driving rising sea levels
which, along with more erratic weather, make farmland
increasingly vulnerable to flooding and failed harvests.
Hotter seas also fuel more powerful cyclones and other
storms, which can drive saltwater onto land.
With fewer mangrove forests to buffer coastal land, soil is
becoming salty - which kills crops - and or is being washed away
by heavy rains, scientists say.
Warming oceans also threaten fish, especially in areas such
as Kenya that have experienced coral bleaching.
""Fishermen report that some of the species are disappearing

              <p>DUBAI, Oct 28 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Fenced off by a
wall of trees, about 20 km from the high rises towering over
Dubai's city centre, there lies a small solar-powered settlement
aiming to become a green oasis in the desert.</p>
              <p>Renowned for its glitzy skyscrapers,
air-conditioning-blasting shopping malls and indoor skiing
facilities, the emirate of Dubai has long been the antithesis of
sustainability to environmentalists.</p>
              <p>But the United Arab Emirates (UAE) plans to change that
reputation, with a range of projects aimed at having more than
40% of the country's energy come from renewable sources and
cutting consumption by the same margin by 2050.</p>
              <p>Opened to the first residents in 2016 and to be fully
completed next year, the initiative dubbed Sustainable City is a
private settlement on the outskirts of Dubai designed to use as
little energy and water as possible.</p>
              <p>Comprising 500 low-lying villas that are home to nearly
3,000 people, as well as commercial spaces and a mosque, the
city aims to be a ""net-zero"" settlement, producing all the
energy it needs from renewable sources on site.</p>
              <p>""The Sustainable City is a living laboratory for testing
future technologies and solutions,"" said Karim El-Jisr, head of
SEE Institute, the research arm of the city's developer, Diamond
Developers.</p>
              <p>When the project started six years ago, building a
zero-energy development ""seemed a bit like a dream"", he told the
Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p>""Today it is not difficult anymore, tomorrow everybody will
have to do it,"" he added.</p>
              <p>From neighbouring Masdar City to the Qatari capital Doha, it
is one of several developments launched across the region in
recent years that aim to serve as a model for environmentally-
friendly living in the Middle East.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>GREEN DESERT</p>
              <p>Houses, offices and other buildings are responsible for
about 40% of planet-warming emissions globally, according to the
think tank World Resources Institute (WRI).</p>
              <p>The issue is particularly relevant in the UAE, said Emma
Stewart, who leads WRI's urban efficiency and climate programme,
with World Bank data showing that the country has one of the
highest per capita carbon footprints in the world.</p>
              <p>About 75% of all electricity produced in the UAE is sucked
up by buildings, mainly to fuel air-conditioners that keep
locals fresh during the scorching summer months, Stewart said.</p>
              <p>""They have an immense need for cooling to keep the
population within their comfort range,"" she said in a phone
interview.</p>
              <p>In the Sustainable City, residents zig zag through the
streets on bicycles or aboard small electric carts, under the
shade of the palm trees flanking the strips of square, white
houses. Cars are banned from most of the area.</p>
              <p>All buildings and parking spaces are topped by solar panels
which feed the energy they produce into the grid, allowing
residents to pay only the difference between what they produce
and consume, according to the developer.</p>
              <p>Residential units designed to avoid direct exposure to the
sun and covered in paint that reflects sunlight to keep the heat
out, while wastewater is recycled to irrigate green areas,
El-Jisr said during a visit to the site.</p>
              <p>Resident Belinda Boisson said she paid more rent than the
Dubai average but, besides sustainability, the development
offered a family-friendly environment and sense of community
that was rare to find among Dubai's high rises.</p>
              <p>""(Children) can play outside without me worrying about my
daughter being hit by a car,"" said Boisson, a 46-year-old expat
from South Africa.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>ZERO-CARBON WAVE</p>
              <p>The Dubai settlement is the first in the region - which is
particularly vulnerable to extreme heat, droughts and rising sea
levels, according to the World Bank - to become fully
operational, says its developer.</p>
              <p>In neighbouring Abu Dhabi, the state-sponsored Masdar City
was touted as the world's first emissions-free city and designed
to house up to 50,000 people. After breaking ground in 2008 the
settlement remains behind schedule and sparsely populated.</p>
              <p>In Qatar, the Msheireb area of Doha is also undergoing a
carbon-cutting makeover.</p>
              <p>Developers of the 76-acre regeneration zone, which aims to
become ""one of the largest sustainable cities in the world"", are
outfitting it with green features, from rainwater harvesting to
shady overhangs that make walking outside cooler.</p>
              <p>A similar city extension based on the Msheireb project is
being planned in Muscat, Oman, while Diamond Developers is
building another ""sustainable city"" in the emirate of Sharjah
which will be about twice the size of the one in Dubai.</p>
              <p>This second green city hopes to improve on the first, where
not everything has worked according to plan, El-Jisr said.</p>
              <p>A grey-water system set up to use water from showers and
washing machines to feed the city's artificial lake was
decommissioned when developers realised the phosphates from the
soap were fuelling unsightly blooms of algae, he said.</p>
              <p>The water is now used for irrigation, but the city still
relies heavily on water from Dubai's energy-intensive
desalination plants, El-Jisr added.</p>
              <p>And the settlement still consumes more energy than it
produces, he explained.</p>
              <p>In a bid to reduce consumption, new motion-activated
lighting is being installed and the developers are looking for
new ideas to improve efficiency, said El-Jisr.</p>
              <p>""It is not enough to design, build and then walk away,"" he
added. ""You always have to make adjustments.""</p>
              <p/>
              <p>TESTING GROUND</p>
              <p>Low-carbon projects like Dubai's Sustainable City are useful
testing grounds for cities looking to go green, said Abdulla Al
Basti, the head of Dubai's executive council.</p>
              <p>But they are no magic bullet against global warming, said
Alessandro Melis, an architecture professor at Britain's
University of Portsmouth.</p>
              <p>""They are good experiments that can tell us many things, but
at this moment in time it would be more important to focus on
how we can transform the urban fabric that we already have,""
Melis said in a phone interview.</p>
              <p>Stewart of the WRI agreed, saying that building new
developments, however sustainable, can be less efficient than
retrofitting existing ones.</p>
              <p>Construction works account for on average about 10% of all
emissions generated by a building's lifecycle, she noted.</p>
              <p>However, by showing what is possible, new builds could
inspire policymakers to take bolder action, she said.</p>
              <p>In September, the UAE pledged that by 2030 all new buildings
will produce no more emissions than they can absorb, and all
existing buildings will meet that goal by 2050 - a promise Melis
said was ambitious but technically feasible.</p>
              <p>And if a group of desert emirates can find a way to go
green, it could prove a powerful example to other cities, said
Stewart.</p>
              <p>""If this can be done in a desert environment that is
difficult for humans to inhabit... it can be done everywhere,""
she said.

DUBAI, Oct 28 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Fenced off by a
wall of trees, about 20 km from the high rises towering over
Dubai's city centre, there lies a small solar-powered settlement
aiming to become a green oasis in the desert.
Renowned for its glitzy skyscrapers,
air-conditioning-blasting shopping malls and indoor skiing
facilities, the emirate of Dubai has long been the antithesis of
sustainability to environmentalists.
But the United Arab Emirates (UAE) plans to change that
reputation, with a range of projects aimed at having more than
40% of the country's energy come from renewable sources and
cutting consumption by the same margin by 2050.
Opened to the first residents in 2016 and to be fully
completed next year, the initiative dubbed Sustainable City is a
private settlement on the outskirts of Dubai designed to use as
little energy and water as possible.
Comprising 500 low-lying villas that are home to nearly
3,000 people, as well as commercial spaces and a mosque, the
city aims to be a ""net-zero"" settlement, producing all the
energy it needs from renewable sources on site.
""The Sustainable City is a living laboratory for testing
future technologies and solutions,"" said Karim El-Jisr, head of
SEE Institute, the research arm of the city's developer, Diamond
Developers.
When the project started six years ago, building a
zero-energy development ""seemed a bit like a dream"", he told the
Thomson Reuters Foundation.
""Today it is not difficult anymore, tomorrow everybody will
have to do it,"" he added.
From neighbouring Masdar City to the Qatari capital Doha, it
is one of several developments launched across the region in
recent years that aim to serve as a model for environmentally-
friendly living in the Middle East.

GREEN DESERT
Houses, offices and other buildings are responsible for
about 40% of planet-warming emissions globally, according to the
think tank World Resources Institute (WRI).
The issue is particularly relevant in the UAE, said Emma
Stewart, who leads WRI's urban efficiency and climate programme,
with World Bank data showing that the country has one of the
highest per capita carbon footprints in the world.
About 75% of all electricity produced in the UAE is sucked
up by buildings, mainly to fuel air-conditioners that keep
locals fresh during the scorching summer months, Stewart said.
""They have an immense need for cooling to keep the
population within their comfort range,"" she said in a phone
interview.
In the Sustainable City, residents zig zag through the
streets on bicycles or aboard small electric carts, under the
shade of the palm trees flanking the strips of square, white
houses. Cars are banned from most of the area.
All buildings and parking spaces are topped by solar panels
which feed the energy they produce into the grid, allowing
residents to pay only the difference between what they produce
and consume, according to the developer.
Residential units designed to avoid direct exposure to the
sun and covered in paint that reflects sunlight to keep the heat
out, while wastewater is recycled to irrigate green areas,
El-Jisr said during a visit to the site.
Resident Belinda Boisson said she paid more rent than the
Dubai average but, besides sustainability, the development
offered a family-friendly environment and sense of community
that was rare to find among Dubai's high rises.
""(Children) can play outside without me worrying about my
daughter being hit by a car,"" said Boisson, a 46-year-old expat
from South Africa.

ZERO-CARBON WAVE
The Dubai settlement is the first in the region - which is
particularly vulnerable to extreme heat, droughts and rising sea
levels, according to the World Bank - to become fully
operational, says its developer.
In neighbouring Abu Dhabi, the state-sponsored Masdar City
was touted as the world's first emissions-free city and designed
to house up to 50,000 people. After breaking ground in 2008 the
settlement remains behind schedule and sparsely populated.
In Qatar, the Msheireb area of Doha is also undergoing a
carbon-cutting makeover.
Developers of the 76-acre regeneration zone, which aims to
become ""one of the largest sustainable cities in the world"", are
outfitting it with green features, from rainwater harvesting to
shady overhangs that make walking outside cooler.
A similar city extension based on the Msheireb project is
being planned in Muscat, Oman, while Diamond Developers is
building another ""sustainable city"" in the emirate of Sharjah
which will be about twice the size of the one in Dubai.
This second green city hopes to improve on the first, where
not everything has worked according to plan, El-Jisr said.
A grey-water system set up to use water from showers and
washing machines to feed the city's artificial lake was
decommissioned when developers realised the phosphates from the
soap were fuelling unsightly blooms of algae, he said.
The water is now used for irrigation, but the city still
relies heavily on water from Dubai's energy-intensive
desalination plants, El-Jisr added.
And the settlement still consumes more energy than it
produces, he explained.
In a bid to reduce consumption, new motion-activated
lighting is being installed and the developers are looking for
new ideas to improve efficiency, said El-Jisr.
""It is not enough to design, build and then walk away,"" he
added. ""You always have to make adjustments.""

TESTING GROUND
Low-carbon projects like Dubai's Sustainable City are useful
testing grounds for cities looking to go green, said Abdulla Al
Basti, the head of Dubai's executive council.
But they are no magic bullet against global warming, said
Alessandro Melis, an architecture professor at Britain's
University of Portsmouth.
""They are good experiments that can tell us many things, but
at this moment in time it would be more important to focus on
how we can transform the urban fabric that we already have,""
Melis said in a phone interview.
Stewart of the WRI agreed, saying that building new
developments, however sustainable, can be less efficient than
retrofitting existing ones.
Construction works account for on average about 10% of all
emissions generated by a building's lifecycle, she noted.
However, by showing what is possible, new builds could
inspire policymakers to take bolder action, she said.
In September, the UAE pledged that by 2030 all new buildings
will produce no more emissions than they can absorb, and all
existing buildings will meet that goal by 2050 - a promise Melis
said was ambitious but technically feasible.
And if a group of desert emirates can find a way to go
green, it could prove a powerful example to other cities, said
Stewart.
""If this can be done in a desert environment that is
difficult for humans to inhabit... it can be done everywhere,""
she said.

              <p>BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Iraqi jihadist who rose from obscurity to declare himself ""caliph"" of all Muslims as the leader of Islamic State, has died in a raid by U.S. special forces in northwest Syria.</p>
              <p>U.S. President Donald Trump said in a televised address from the White House that Baghdadi killed himself during the raid by igniting a suicide vest. Test results from the aftermath of the raid had positively identified Baghdadi, he said.</p>
              <p>Baghdadi had long been a target for U.S. and regional security forces trying to eliminate Islamic State, even as they reclaimed most of the territory the group once held.</p>
              <p>The Islamic State or caliphate that Baghdadi declared in July 2014 over a quarter of Iraq and Syria was notable for atrocities against religious minorities and attacks on five continents in the name of a version of an ultra-fanatic Islam that horrified mainstream Muslims.</p>
              <p>The genocide of Yazidis, adherents of one of the Middle East's oldest religions, illustrated the brutality of his rule. Thousands of men were slaughtered on their ancestral Sinjar mountain in northwestern Iraq and women were killed or taken as sex slaves. Some other religious groups suffered sexual slavery, slaughter and floggings.</p>
              <p>The group also caused global revulsion with beheadings of hostages from countries including the United States, Britain and Japan.</p>
              <p>The United States put up a $25 million reward for his capture, the same amount as it had offered for al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and his successor Ayman al-Zawahri. </p>
              <p>U.S. air strikes had already killed most of Baghdadi's top lieutenants, including Abu Omar al-Shishani, Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, Abu Ali al-Anbari, Abu Sayyaf and the group's spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani. Thousands of his fighters were also killed or captured.</p>
              <p>Baghdadi was born Ibrahim Awad al-Samarrai in 1971 in Tobchi, a poor area near the town of Samarra, north of the Iraqi capital Baghdad, whose name he took. </p>
              <p>His family included preachers from the ultra-conservative Salafi school of Sunni Islam, which sees many other branches of the faith as heretical and other religions as anathema.</p>
              <p>He joined the Salafi jihadist insurgency in 2003, the year of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, and was captured by the Americans. They released him about a year later, thinking he was a civilian agitator rather than a military threat.</p>
              <p>It was not until July 4, 2014, that he seized the world's attention, climbing the pulpit of Mosul's medieval al-Nuri mosque in black clerical garb during Friday prayers to announce the restoration of the caliphate. </p>
              <p>""God ordered us to fight his enemies,"" he said in a video of the occasion, which presented him as ""Caliph Ibrahim, commander of the faithful"". </p>
              <p>Thousands of volunteers flocked into Iraq and Syria from around the world to become ""Jund al-Khilafa"" - soldiers of the caliphate and join him in his fight against the Shi'ite-led  Iraqi government and its U.S. and Western allies. </p>
              <p/>
              <p>'MAKE THEIR BLOOD FLOW AS RIVERS'</p>
              <p>At the height of its power in 2016, Islamic State ruled over millions of people in territory running from northern Syria through towns and villages along the Tigris and Euphrates river valleys to the outskirts of Baghdad.</p>
              <p>The group claimed responsibility for or inspired attacks in dozens of cities including Paris, Nice, Orlando, Manchester, London and Berlin, and in nearby Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.</p>
              <p>In Iraq, it staged dozens of attacks on predominantly Shi'ite Muslim areas. A truck bomb in July 2016 killed more than 324 people in a crowded area of Baghdad, the deadliest attack since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.</p>
              <p>The group also carried out many bombings in northeast Syria, which has been under the control of U.S.-backed Kurdish forces.</p>
              <p>Most of Baghdadi's speeches were distributed as audio recordings, a medium better suited to the secretive, careful character that for a long time helped him evade the surveillance and air strikes that killed more than 40 of his top commanders.</p>
              <p>That caution was matched by ruthlessness as he eliminated opponents and former allies, even within Salafi jihadist ranks. He waged war on al Qaeda's Syrian wing, the Nusra Front, breaking with the movement's global leader, al-Zawahri, in 2013.</p>
              <p>But by the time of his death in the raid this weekend, his fortunes - and those of Islamic State - were in rapid decline. </p>
              <p>With the defeat of Islamic State in its stronghold Mosul, which he declared as the capital of his caliphate, in 2017 the movement lost all the territory it once controlled in Iraq.</p>
              <p>In Syria, Islamic State lost Raqqa, its second capital and center of operations, and eventually earlier this year its final chunk of territory there when U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces took back Baghouz.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>STILL A THREAT</p>
              <p>While the destruction of the quasi-state that Baghdadi built has denied the group its recruiting tool and logistical base from which it could train fighters and plan coordinated attacks overseas, most security experts believe Islamic State remains a threat through clandestine operations or attacks.</p>
              <p>Islamic State is believed to have sleeper cells around the world, and some fighters operate from the shadows in Syria's desert and Iraq's cities, still launching hit-and-run attacks.</p>
              <p>In his most recent audio message, in September, Baghdadi put on a brave face, saying operations were taking place daily and urging followers to secure freedom for women jailed in Iraq and Syria over their alleged links to the group.</p>
              <p>""As for the worst and most important matter, the prisons, the prisons, oh soldiers of the caliphate. Your brothers and sisters; do your utmost to free them and tear down the walls restricting them,"" Baghdadi said.</p>
              <p>But the loss of territory in Iraq and Syria stripped him of the trappings of caliph and made him a fugitive in the desert border area between the two countries.</p>
              <p>He was forced to travel incognito in ordinary cars or farm pick-up trucks between hideouts on both sides of the border, escorted only by his driver and two bodyguards. </p>
              <p>The region was familiar territory to his men. It was the hotbed of the Sunni insurgency against first the U.S. forces in Iraq and then the Shi'ite-led governments that took over the country.</p>
              <p>Fearing assassination or betrayal, he was not able to use phones and trusted only a handful of couriers to communicate with his two main Iraqi aides, Iyad al-Obaidi, his defense minister, and Ayad al-Jumaili, his security chief.</p>
              <p>The two had been believed to be among the likely candidates to succeed Baghdadi, but Jumaili was killed in April 2017 and Obaidi's whereabouts are unknown. </p>
              <p>In any case, their military background and lack of religious credentials mean that any of Baghdadi's deputies would struggle to inherit his claims to be caliph. </p>

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Iraqi jihadist who rose from obscurity to declare himself ""caliph"" of all Muslims as the leader of Islamic State, has died in a raid by U.S. special forces in northwest Syria.
U.S. President Donald Trump said in a televised address from the White House that Baghdadi killed himself during the raid by igniting a suicide vest. Test results from the aftermath of the raid had positively identified Baghdadi, he said.
Baghdadi had long been a target for U.S. and regional security forces trying to eliminate Islamic State, even as they reclaimed most of the territory the group once held.
The Islamic State or caliphate that Baghdadi declared in July 2014 over a quarter of Iraq and Syria was notable for atrocities against religious minorities and attacks on five continents in the name of a version of an ultra-fanatic Islam that horrified mainstream Muslims.
The genocide of Yazidis, adherents of one of the Middle East's oldest religions, illustrated the brutality of his rule. Thousands of men were slaughtered on their ancestral Sinjar mountain in northwestern Iraq and women were killed or taken as sex slaves. Some other religious groups suffered sexual slavery, slaughter and floggings.
The group also caused global revulsion with beheadings of hostages from countries including the United States, Britain and Japan.
The United States put up a $25 million reward for his capture, the same amount as it had offered for al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and his successor Ayman al-Zawahri. 
U.S. air strikes had already killed most of Baghdadi's top lieutenants, including Abu Omar al-Shishani, Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, Abu Ali al-Anbari, Abu Sayyaf and the group's spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani. Thousands of his fighters were also killed or captured.
Baghdadi was born Ibrahim Awad al-Samarrai in 1971 in Tobchi, a poor area near the town of Samarra, north of the Iraqi capital Baghdad, whose name he took. 
His family included preachers from the ultra-conservative Salafi school of Sunni Islam, which sees many other branches of the faith as heretical and other religions as anathema.
He joined the Salafi jihadist insurgency in 2003, the year of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, and was captured by the Americans. They released him about a year later, thinking he was a civilian agitator rather than a military threat.
It was not until July 4, 2014, that he seized the world's attention, climbing the pulpit of Mosul's medieval al-Nuri mosque in black clerical garb during Friday prayers to announce the restoration of the caliphate. 
""God ordered us to fight his enemies,"" he said in a video of the occasion, which presented him as ""Caliph Ibrahim, commander of the faithful"". 
Thousands of volunteers flocked into Iraq and Syria from around the world to become ""Jund al-Khilafa"" - soldiers of the caliphate and join him in his fight against the Shi'ite-led  Iraqi government and its U.S. and Western allies. 

'MAKE THEIR BLOOD FLOW AS RIVERS'
At the height of its power in 2016, Islamic State ruled over millions of people in territory running from northern Syria through towns and villages along the Tigris and Euphrates river valleys to the outskirts of Baghdad.
The group claimed responsibility for or inspired attacks in dozens of cities including Paris, Nice, Orlando, Manchester, London and Berlin, and in nearby Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
In Iraq, it staged dozens of attacks on predominantly Shi'ite Muslim areas. A truck bomb in July 2016 killed more than 324 people in a crowded area of Baghdad, the deadliest attack since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.
The group also carried out many bombings in northeast Syria, which has been under the control of U.S.-backed Kurdish forces.
Most of Baghdadi's speeches were distributed as audio recordings, a medium better suited to the secretive, careful character that for a long time helped him evade the surveillance and air strikes that killed more than 40 of his top commanders.
That caution was matched by ruthlessness as he eliminated opponents and former allies, even within Salafi jihadist ranks. He waged war on al Qaeda's Syrian wing, the Nusra Front, breaking with the movement's global leader, al-Zawahri, in 2013.
But by the time of his death in the raid this weekend, his fortunes - and those of Islamic State - were in rapid decline. 
With the defeat of Islamic State in its stronghold Mosul, which he declared as the capital of his caliphate, in 2017 the movement lost all the territory it once controlled in Iraq.
In Syria, Islamic State lost Raqqa, its second capital and center of operations, and eventually earlier this year its final chunk of territory there when U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces took back Baghouz.

STILL A THREAT
While the destruction of the quasi-state that Baghdadi built has denied the group its recruiting tool and logistical base from which it could train fighters and plan coordinated attacks overseas, most security experts believe Islamic State remains a threat through clandestine operations or attacks.
Islamic State is believed to have sleeper cells around the world, and some fighters operate from the shadows in Syria's desert and Iraq's cities, still launching hit-and-run attacks.
In his most recent audio message, in September, Baghdadi put on a brave face, saying operations were taking place daily and urging followers to secure freedom for women jailed in Iraq and Syria over their alleged links to the group.
""As for the worst and most important matter, the prisons, the prisons, oh soldiers of the caliphate. Your brothers and sisters; do your utmost to free them and tear down the walls restricting them,"" Baghdadi said.
But the loss of territory in Iraq and Syria stripped him of the trappings of caliph and made him a fugitive in the desert border area between the two countries.
He was forced to travel incognito in ordinary cars or farm pick-up trucks between hideouts on both sides of the border, escorted only by his driver and two bodyguards. 
The region was familiar territory to his men. It was the hotbed of the Sunni insurgency against first the U.S. forces in Iraq and then the Shi'ite-led governments that took over the country.
Fearing assassination or betrayal, he was not able to use phones and trusted only a handful of couriers to communicate with his two main Iraqi aides, Iyad al-Obaidi, his defense minister, and Ayad al-Jumaili, his security chief.
The two had been believed to be among the likely candidates to succeed Baghdadi, but Jumaili was killed in April 2017 and Obaidi's whereabouts are unknown. 
In any case, their military background and lack of religious credentials mean that any of Baghdadi's deputies would struggle to inherit his claims to be caliph.

              <p>BAGHDAD, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Iraqi
jihadist who rose from obscurity to declare himself ""caliph"" of
all Muslims as the leader of Islamic State, has been targeted in
a U.S. military operation in Syria.</p>
              <p>Sources in Syria, Iraq and Iran said on Sunday they believed
he had been killed. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told Reuters that Baghdadi was targeted in the
overnight raid but was unable to say whether the operation was
successful. U.S. President Donald Trump was due to make a
""major statement"" at the White House later on
Sunday.</p>
              <p>Baghdadi has long been a target for U.S. and regional
security forces trying to eliminate Islamic State, even as they
reclaimed most of the territory the group once held.</p>
              <p>The Islamic State or caliphate that Baghdadi declared in
July 2014 over a quarter of Iraq and Syria was notable for
atrocities against religious minorities and attacks on five
continents in the name of a version of an ultra-fanatic Islam
that horrified mainstream Muslims.</p>
              <p>The genocide of Yazidis, adherents of one of the Middle
East's oldest religions, illustrated the brutality of his rule.
Thousands of men were slaughtered on their ancestral Sinjar
mountain in northwestern Iraq and women were killed or taken as
sex slaves. Some other religious groups suffered sexual slavery,
slaughter and floggings.</p>
              <p>The group also caused global revulsion with beheadings of
hostages from countries including the United States, Britain and
Japan.</p>
              <p>The United States put up a $25 million reward for his
capture, the same amount as it had offered for al Qaeda leader
Osama bin Laden and his successor Ayman al-Zawahri.</p>
              <p>U.S. air strikes have killed most of Baghdadi's top
lieutenants, including Abu Omar al-Shishani, Abu Muslim
al-Turkmani, Abu Ali al-Anbari, Abu Sayyaf and the group's
spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani. Thousands of his fighters were
also killed or captured.</p>
              <p>Baghdadi was born Ibrahim Awad al-Samarrai in 1971 in
Tobchi, a poor area near the town of Samarra, north of the Iraqi
capital Baghdad, whose name he took.</p>
              <p>His family includes preachers from the ultra-conservative
Salafi school of Sunni Islam, which sees many other branches of
the faith as heretical and other religions as anathema.</p>
              <p>He joined the Salafi jihadist insurgency in 2003, the year
of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, and was captured by the
Americans. They released him about a year later, thinking he was
a civilian agitator rather than a military threat.</p>
              <p>It was not until July 4, 2014, that he seized the world's
attention, climbing the pulpit of Mosul's medieval al-Nuri
mosque in black clerical garb during Friday prayers to announce
the restoration of the caliphate.</p>
              <p>""God ordered us to fight his enemies,"" he said in a video of
the occasion, which presented him as ""Caliph Ibrahim, commander
of the faithful"".</p>
              <p>Thousands of volunteers flocked into Iraq and Syria from
around the world to become ""Jund al-Khilafa"" -- soldiers of the
caliphate and join him in his fight against the Shi'ite-led
Iraqi government and its U.S. and Western allies.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>'MAKE THEIR BLOOD FLOW AS RIVERS'</p>
              <p>At the height of its power in 2016, Islamic State ruled over
millions of people in territory running from northern Syria
through towns and villages along the Tigris and Euphrates river
valleys to the outskirts of Baghdad.</p>
              <p>The group claimed responsibility for or inspired attacks in
dozens of cities including Paris, Nice, Orlando, Manchester,
London and Berlin, and in nearby Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia and
Egypt.</p>
              <p>In Iraq, it staged dozens of attacks on predominantly
Shi'ite Muslim areas. A truck bomb in July 2016 killed more than
324 people in a crowded area of Baghdad, the deadliest attack
since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.</p>
              <p>The group also carried out many bombings in northeast Syria,
which has been under the control of U.S.-backed Kurdish forces.</p>
              <p>Most of Baghdadi's speeches were distributed as audio
recordings, a medium better suited to the secretive, careful
character that for a long time helped him evade the surveillance
and air strikes that killed more than 40 of his top commanders.</p>
              <p>That caution was matched by ruthlessness as he eliminated
opponents and former allies, even within Salafi jihadist ranks.
He waged war on al Qaeda's Syrian wing, the Nusra Front,
breaking with the movement's global leader, al-Zawahri, in 2013.</p>
              <p>But by the time of the raid against him this weekend, his
fortunes - and those of Islamic State - were in rapid decline.</p>
              <p>With the defeat of Islamic State in its stronghold Mosul,
which he declared as the capital of his caliphate, in 2017 the
movement lost all the territory it once controlled in Iraq.</p>
              <p>In Syria, Islamic State lost Raqqa, its second capital and
centre of operations, and eventually earlier this year its final
chunk of territory there when U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces
took back Baghouz.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>STILL A THREAT</p>
              <p>While the destruction of the quasi-state that Baghdadi built
has denied the group its recruiting tool and logistical base
from which it could train fighters and plan coordinated attacks
overseas, most security experts believe Islamic State remains a
threat through clandestine operations or attacks.
Islamic State is believed to have sleeper cells around the
world, and some fighters operate from the shadows in Syria's
desert and Iraq's cities, still launching hit-and-run attacks.</p>
              <p>In his most recent audio message, in September, Baghdadi put
on a brave face, saying operations were taking place daily and
urging followers to secure freedom for women jailed in Iraq and
Syria over their alleged links to the group.</p>
              <p>""As for the worst and most important matter, the prisons,
the prisons, oh soldiers of the caliphate. Your brothers and
sisters; do your utmost to free them and tear down the walls
restricting them,"" Baghdadi said.</p>
              <p>But the loss of territory in Iraq and Syria stripped him of
the trappings of caliph and made him a fugitive in the desert
border area between the two countries.</p>
              <p>He was forced to travel incognito in ordinary cars or farm
pick-up trucks between hideouts on both sides of the border,
escorted only by his driver and two bodyguards.</p>
              <p>The region is familiar territory to his men. It was the
hotbed of the Sunni insurgency against first the U.S. forces in
Iraq and then the Shi'ite-led governments that took over the
country.</p>
              <p>Fearing assassination or betrayal, he has not been able to
use phones and trusted only a handful of couriers to communicate
with his two main Iraqi aides, Iyad al-Obaidi, his defence
minister, and Ayad al-Jumaili, his security chief.</p>
              <p>The two have been believed to be among the likely candidates
for his succession, but Jumaili was killed in April 2017 and
Obaidi's whereabouts are unknown.</p>
              <p>In any case, their military background and lack of religious
credentials mean that any of Baghdadi's deputies would struggle
to inherit his claims to be caliph if he has been killed.</p>

Baghdadi has long been a target for U.S. and regional
security forces trying to eliminate Islamic State, even as they
reclaimed most of the territory the group once held.
The Islamic State or caliphate that Baghdadi declared in
July 2014 over a quarter of Iraq and Syria was notable for
atrocities against religious minorities and attacks on five
continents in the name of a version of an ultra-fanatic Islam
that horrified mainstream Muslims.
The genocide of Yazidis, adherents of one of the Middle
East's oldest religions, illustrated the brutality of his rule.
Thousands of men were slaughtered on their ancestral Sinjar
mountain in northwestern Iraq and women were killed or taken as
sex slaves. Some other religious groups suffered sexual slavery,
slaughter and floggings.
The group also caused global revulsion with beheadings of
hostages from countries including the United States, Britain and
Japan.
The United States put up a $25 million reward for his
capture, the same amount as it had offered for al Qaeda leader
Osama bin Laden and his successor Ayman al-Zawahri.
U.S. air strikes have killed most of Baghdadi's top
lieutenants, including Abu Omar al-Shishani, Abu Muslim
al-Turkmani, Abu Ali al-Anbari, Abu Sayyaf and the group's
spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani. Thousands of his fighters were
also killed or captured.
Baghdadi was born Ibrahim Awad al-Samarrai in 1971 in
Tobchi, a poor area near the town of Samarra, north of the Iraqi
capital Baghdad, whose name he took.
His family includes preachers from the ultra-conservative
Salafi school of Sunni Islam, which sees many other branches of
the faith as heretical and other religions as anathema.
He joined the Salafi jihadist insurgency in 2003, the year
of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, and was captured by the
Americans. They released him about a year later, thinking he was
a civilian agitator rather than a military threat.
It was not until July 4, 2014, that he seized the world's
attention, climbing the pulpit of Mosul's medieval al-Nuri
mosque in black clerical garb during Friday prayers to announce
the restoration of the caliphate.
""God ordered us to fight his enemies,"" he said in a video of
the occasion, which presented him as ""Caliph Ibrahim, commander
of the faithful"".
Thousands of volunteers flocked into Iraq and Syria from
around the world to become ""Jund al-Khilafa"" -- soldiers of the
caliphate and join him in his fight against the Shi'ite-led
Iraqi government and its U.S. and Western allies.

'MAKE THEIR BLOOD FLOW AS RIVERS'
At the height of its power in 2016, Islamic State ruled over
millions of people in territory running from northern Syria
through towns and villages along the Tigris and Euphrates river
valleys to the outskirts of Baghdad.
The group claimed responsibility for or inspired attacks in
dozens of cities including Paris, Nice, Orlando, Manchester,
London and Berlin, and in nearby Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia and
Egypt.
In Iraq, it staged dozens of attacks on predominantly
Shi'ite Muslim areas. A truck bomb in July 2016 killed more than
324 people in a crowded area of Baghdad, the deadliest attack
since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.
The group also carried out many bombings in northeast Syria,
which has been under the control of U.S.-backed Kurdish forces.
Most of Baghdadi's speeches were distributed as audio
recordings, a medium better suited to the secretive, careful
character that for a long time helped him evade the surveillance
and air strikes that killed more than 40 of his top commanders.
That caution was matched by ruthlessness as he eliminated
opponents and former allies, even within Salafi jihadist ranks.
He waged war on al Qaeda's Syrian wing, the Nusra Front,
breaking with the movement's global leader, al-Zawahri, in 2013.
But by the time of the raid against him this weekend, his
fortunes - and those of Islamic State - were in rapid decline.
With the defeat of Islamic State in its stronghold Mosul,
which he declared as the capital of his caliphate, in 2017 the
movement lost all the territory it once controlled in Iraq.
In Syria, Islamic State lost Raqqa, its second capital and
centre of operations, and eventually earlier this year its final
chunk of territory there when U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces
took back Baghouz.

STILL A THREAT
While the destruction of the quasi-state that Baghdadi built
has denied the group its recruiting tool and logistical base
from which it could train fighters and plan coordinated attacks
overseas, most security experts believe Islamic State remains a
threat through clandestine operations or attacks.
Islamic State is believed to have sleeper cells around the
world, and some fighters operate from the shadows in Syria's
desert and Iraq's cities, still launching hit-and-run attacks.
In his most recent audio message, in September, Baghdadi put
on a brave face, saying operations were taking place daily and
urging followers to secure freedom for women jailed in Iraq and
Syria over their alleged links to the group.
""As for the worst and most important matter, the prisons,
the prisons, oh soldiers of the caliphate. Your brothers and
sisters; do your utmost to free them and tear down the walls
restricting them,"" Baghdadi said.
But the loss of territory in Iraq and Syria stripped him of
the trappings of caliph and made him a fugitive in the desert
border area between the two countries.
He was forced to travel incognito in ordinary cars or farm
pick-up trucks between hideouts on both sides of the border,
escorted only by his driver and two bodyguards.
The region is familiar territory to his men. It was the
hotbed of the Sunni insurgency against first the U.S. forces in
Iraq and then the Shi'ite-led governments that took over the
country.
Fearing assassination or betrayal, he has not been able to
use phones and trusted only a handful of couriers to communicate
with his two main Iraqi aides, Iyad al-Obaidi, his defence
minister, and Ayad al-Jumaili, his security chief.
The two have been believed to be among the likely candidates
for his succession, but Jumaili was killed in April 2017 and
Obaidi's whereabouts are unknown.
In any case, their military background and lack of religious
credentials mean that any of Baghdadi's deputies would struggle
to inherit his claims to be caliph if he has been killed.

              <p>The bodies were discovered on Wednesday after emergency services were alerted to people in a truck container on an industrial site in Grays, about 32 km (20 miles) east of central London.</p>
              <p>British police said on Saturday that they had charged one man, 25-year-old Maurice Robinson of Craigavon in Northern Ireland, with 39 counts of manslaughter and other offences including conspiracy to traffic people.</p>
              <p>Police initially believed the dead were Chinese, but Beijing said the nationalities had not been confirmed and on Saturday a senior British police officer in charge of identification asked for help from Britain's Vietnamese community.</p>
              <p>Chinese and Vietnamese officials are now both working closely with British police, the two countries' embassies have said. Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc ordered government officials to help establish the identities of the victims and look into cases of Vietnamese citizens sent abroad illegally.</p>
              <p>Father Anthony Dang Huu Nam, a Catholic priest in the remote town of Yen Thanh in northern-central Vietnam's Nghe An province, 300 km (180 miles) south of Hanoi, said he believed most of the dead were likely from Vietnam. He told Reuters he was liaising with family members.</p>
              <p>""The whole district is covered in sorrow,"" Nam said, as prayers for the dead rang out over loudspeakers throughout the misty, rain-soaked town on Saturday. ""This is a catastrophe for our community.""</p>
              <p>On Saturday evening, Nam led around 500 worshippers in prayers for the dead as they held lit candles in the modest, white-walled church in Yen Thanh.</p>
              <p>""We are here to pray for justice and peace, and for the victims of society. We pray for the 39 people who lost their lives on the way to the UK. They are people coming from central Vietnam, our land,"" Nam said.</p>
              <p>Nam said families had told him they knew relatives were traveling to Britain at the time the container truck was traveling, and had been unable to contact their loved ones.</p>
              <p>The British police officer in charge of identifying the victims, Detective Chief Inspector Martin Pasmore, said very few were carrying official identification and that he hoped to identify the dead through fingerprints, dental records and DNA, as well as photos from friends and relatives.</p>
              <p>Police have found more than 500 items within the truck including bags, clothing and mobile phones that need to be assessed. Once a preliminary identification has been made, liaison officers will be deployed to support families.</p>
              <p>Apart from the man charged, who will appear in court on Monday for an initial hearing, three other people are under arrest in Britain on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking. A fourth person is under arrest in Dublin.</p>

              <p>""She said she was in France and on the way to the UK, where she has friends and relatives,"" said Nhung's cousin, Hoang Thi Linh.</p>
              <p>""We are waiting and hoping it's not her among the victims, but it's very likely. We pray for her every day. There were two people from my village traveling in that group"".</p>
              <p>In comments under a photo uploaded to Nhung's Facebook account on Monday, two days before the doomed truck was discovered, one friend asked how her journey was going.</p>
              <p>""Not good,"" Nhung replied. ""Almost spring,"" she said, using a term in Vietnamese meaning she had almost reached her destination.</p>

              <p>""Such a beautiful day,"" Nhung posted.</p>

              <p>A few months ago, he asked his wife Hoang Thi Thuong to help him raise 11,000 pounds ($14,000) to cover the cost of an illicit trip from Germany to the United Kingdom.</p>

The bodies were discovered on Wednesday after emergency services were alerted to people in a truck container on an industrial site in Grays, about 32 km (20 miles) east of central London.
British police said on Saturday that they had charged one man, 25-year-old Maurice Robinson of Craigavon in Northern Ireland, with 39 counts of manslaughter and other offences including conspiracy to traffic people.
Police initially believed the dead were Chinese, but Beijing said the nationalities had not been confirmed and on Saturday a senior British police officer in charge of identification asked for help from Britain's Vietnamese community.
Chinese and Vietnamese officials are now both working closely with British police, the two countries' embassies have said. Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc ordered government officials to help establish the identities of the victims and look into cases of Vietnamese citizens sent abroad illegally.
Father Anthony Dang Huu Nam, a Catholic priest in the remote town of Yen Thanh in northern-central Vietnam's Nghe An province, 300 km (180 miles) south of Hanoi, said he believed most of the dead were likely from Vietnam. He told Reuters he was liaising with family members.
""The whole district is covered in sorrow,"" Nam said, as prayers for the dead rang out over loudspeakers throughout the misty, rain-soaked town on Saturday. ""This is a catastrophe for our community.""
On Saturday evening, Nam led around 500 worshippers in prayers for the dead as they held lit candles in the modest, white-walled church in Yen Thanh.
""We are here to pray for justice and peace, and for the victims of society. We pray for the 39 people who lost their lives on the way to the UK. They are people coming from central Vietnam, our land,"" Nam said.
Nam said families had told him they knew relatives were travelling to Britain at the time the container truck was travelling, and had been unable to contact their loved ones.
The British police officer in charge of identifying the victims, Detective Chief Inspector Martin Pasmore, said very few were carrying official identification and that he hoped to identify the dead through fingerprints, dental records and DNA, as well as photos from friends and relatives.
Police have found more than 500 items within the truck including bags, clothing and mobile phones that need to be assessed. Once a preliminary identification has been made, liaison officers will be deployed to support families.
Apart from the man charged, who will appear in court on Monday for an initial hearing, three other people are under arrest in Britain on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking. A fourth person is under arrest in Dublin.

'BEAUTIFUL DAY'
In Yen Thanh, Nghe An province, dozens of worried relatives of 19-year-old Bui Thi Nhung gathered in the family's small courtyard home where her distraught mother has been unable to rise from her bed.
""She said she was in France and on the way to the UK, where she has friends and relatives,"" said Nhung's cousin, Hoang Thi Linh.
""We are waiting and hoping it's not her among the victims, but it's very likely. We pray for her every day. There were two people from my village travelling in that group"".
In comments under a photo uploaded to Nhung's Facebook account on Monday, two days before the doomed truck was discovered, one friend asked how her journey was going.
""Not good,"" Nhung replied. ""Almost spring,"" she said, using a term in Vietnamese meaning she had almost reached her destination.
Other photos on her account show her sightseeing in Brussels on Oct. 18.
""Such a beautiful day,"" Nhung posted.
Another person who may have died is Nguyen Dinh Tu, who had been working illegally in Romania, and Germany, where he lost his job. 
A few months ago, he asked his wife Hoang Thi Thuong to help him raise 11,000 pounds to cover the cost of an illicit trip from Germany to the United Kingdom.

""They were supposed to pick him up at the drop-off point but  they called and said Tu was in that truck,"" Tu's father, Nguyen Dinh Sat, told Reuters.
""I haven't heard anything from my son"".

PARENTS 'CAN'T BREATHE'
How the victims came to be in the truck is not yet known.
Some 70% of Vietnamese trafficking cases in the United Kingdom between 2009-2016 were for labour exploitation, including cannabis production and work in nail bars, according to a British government report last year.
""Women and girls from rural areas are also considered more susceptible to trafficking,"" the report said.

prayers for the dead rang out over loudspeakers throughout the
misty, rain-soaked town on Saturday. ""This is a catastrophe for
our community.""
On Saturday evening, Nam led around 500 worshippers in
prayers for the dead as they held lit candles in the modest,
white-walled church in Yen Thanh.
""We are here to pray for justice and peace, and for the
victims of society. We pray for the 39 people who lost their
lives on the way to the UK. They are people coming from central
Vietnam, our land,"" Nam said.
Nam said families had told him they knew relatives were
travelling to Britain at the time the container truck was
travelling, and had been unable to contact their loved ones.
The British police officer in charge of identifying the
victims, Detective Chief Inspector Martin Pasmore, said very few
were carrying official identification and that he hoped to
identify the dead through fingerprints, dental records and DNA,
as well as photos from friends and relatives.
Police have found more than 500 items within the truck
including bags, clothing and mobile phones that need to be
assessed. Once a preliminary identification has been made,
liaison officers will be deployed to support families.
Apart from the man charged, who will appear in court on
Monday for an initial hearing, three other people are under
arrest in Britain on suspicion of manslaughter and human
trafficking. A fourth person is under arrest in Dublin.

'BEAUTIFUL DAY'
In Yen Thanh, Nghe An province, dozens of worried relatives
of 19-year-old Bui Thi Nhung gathered in the family's small
courtyard home where her distraught mother has been unable to
rise from her bed.
""She said she was in France and on the way to the UK, where
she has friends and relatives,"" said Nhung's cousin, Hoang Thi
Linh.
""We are waiting and hoping it's not her among the victims,
but it's very likely. We pray for her every day. There were two
people from my village travelling in that group"".
In comments under a photo uploaded to Nhung's Facebook
account on Monday, two days before the doomed truck was
discovered, one friend asked how her journey was going.
""Not good,"" Nhung replied. ""Almost spring,"" she said, using
a term in Vietnamese meaning she had almost reached her
destination.
Other photos on her account show her sightseeing in Brussels
on Oct. 18.
""Such a beautiful day,"" Nhung posted.
Another person who may have died is Nguyen Dinh Tu, who had
been working illegally in Romania, and Germany, where he lost
his job.
A few months ago, he asked his wife Hoang Thi Thuong to help
him raise 11,000 pounds ($14,000) to cover the cost of an
illicit trip from Germany to the United Kingdom.
""I lost contact with him on October 21,"" Thuong told
Reuters. ""I have a big debt to pay, no hope, and no energy to do
anything"".
Tu's father said relatives in the United Kingdom had told
him that Tu was inside the truck, and had been planning to pick
him up.
""They were supposed to pick him up at the drop-off point but
they called and said Tu was in that truck,"" Tu's father, Nguyen
Dinh Sat, told Reuters.
""I haven't heard anything from my son"".

PARENTS 'CAN'T BREATHE'
How the victims came to be in the truck is not yet known.
Some 70% of Vietnamese trafficking cases in the United
Kingdom between 2009-2016 were for labour exploitation,
including cannabis production and work in nail bars, according
to a British government report last year.
""Women and girls from rural areas are also considered more
susceptible to trafficking,"" the report said.
British police sought to reassure anyone living in Britain
illegally that they would not be investigated if they came
forward to help with the identification.
""If you come to us, we will do all we can to put our arm
around you and take you through this process, and establish as
quickly as possible whether or not we have your loved involved
in this tragic incident, and try and reunite you,"" Pasmore said.
Nghe An is one of Vietnam's poorest provinces, and home to
many victims of human trafficking who end up in Europe,
according to a March report by the Pacific Links Foundation, a
U.S.-based anti-trafficking organisation.
Other victims are believed to come from the neighbouring
province of Ha Tinh, Father Nam said. In the first eight months
of this year, 41,790 people left Ha Tinh looking for work
elsewhere, including overseas, according to state media.
The province was ravaged by one of Vietnam's worst
environmental disasters in 2016 when a steel mill owned by
Taiwan's Formosa Plastics contaminated coastal waters,
devastating local fishing and tourism industries.
Another suspected victim from Ha Tinh, 26-year-old Pham Thi
Tra My, had sent a text message to her mother saying she could
not breathe at about the time the truck container was en route
from Belgium to Britain.
""That girl who said in her message that she couldn't breathe
in the truck? Her parents can't breathe here at home,"" Nam said.

GRAYS, England, Oct 26 (Reuters) - British police want help
from the Vietnamese community in Britain and abroad to identify
the 39 people found dead in the back of a refrigerated truck on
Wednesday, a senior officer said on Saturday.
Detective Chief Inspector Martin Pasmore said his officers
had found ""very, very few ID papers"" among the bodies and hoped
to identify the dead through fingerprints, dental records and
DNA, as well as photos from friends and relatives.
Police initially said they thought the victims might be
Chinese, but have since said they do not want to speculate on
the victims' nationality before they have been formally
identified.
""We don't know exactly the nationality of our individuals.
But at the moment I am going to focus and engage as much as I
possibly can within the Vietnamese community,"" Pasmore said.
People from a rural region in central Vietnam have said they
fear friends and relatives seeking to move to Britain make up a
large number of the dead, who were found in an industrial park
around 20 miles east of London.
The truck driver, a 25-year-old man from Northern Ireland,
has been arrested on suspicion of murder, and three others are
being held on suspicion of human trafficking and manslaughter.
Irish police on Saturday said they had arrested a fifth
person in connection with the investigation.
Pasmore, who is in charge of identifying the bodies but not
running the criminal investigation, said his colleagues were
keeping an open mind about whether the dead were victims of a
wider human trafficking conspiracy.
""Criminals and murderers are taking more and more chances
with these vulnerable people,"" he said.
Pasmore said he had spoken with Vietnam's ambassador to
Britain to seek assistance with fingerprint records.
Pasmore said he had also contacted the operator of a
Vietnamese community website and hoped Vietnamese people in
Britain would ""take a leap of faith"" and help police identify
friends and relatives, even if they were in Britain illegally.

              <p>U.S. imposes sanctions on Zimbabwe's state security minister</p>
              <p>The United States has imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe's state
security minister, Owen Ncube, over what it says is credible
information of his involvement in ""gross violations of human
rights,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday.
Pompeo said in a statement that Washington was troubled by the
""Zimbabwean government's use of state-sanctioned violence
against"" protesters, opposition leaders and labor leaders.</p>

              <p>The U.S. government said on Friday it would bar U.S.
airlines from flying to all destinations in Cuba besides Havana
starting on Dec. 10 as the Trump administration boosts pressure
on the Cuban government.  The U.S. Transportation Department
said in a notice it was taking the action at the request of
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to ""further the administration's
policy of strengthening the economic consequences to the Cuban
regime for its ongoing repression of the Cuban people and its
support for Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela.""</p>
              <p>More Russian military police arrive in Syria under peace
deal with Turkey</p>
              <p>Russia sent about 300 more military police and more than 20
armored vehicles to Syria on Friday under an accord between
Ankara and Moscow that has halted Turkey's military incursion
into northeast Syria. The deal, sealed on Tuesday by Presidents
Tayyip Erdogan and Vladimir Putin, requires that Russian
military police and Syrian border guards remove all Kurdish YPG
militia from within 30 km (19 miles) of the Turkish border by
next Tuesday.</p>

attempted murder</p>
              <p>A Somali immigrant who ran down a Canadian police officer
with a truck and then stabbed him repeatedly was found guilty on
Friday of attempted murder, the Crown prosecutor's office said.
Abdulahi Hasan Sharif, 32, had denied the charges in connection
with the incident in Edmonton, Alberta, on Sept. 30, 2017, when
authorities say he attacked the officer then struck four
pedestrians while trying to flee in a U-Haul truck.</p>
              <p>At least 40 killed as fresh protests engulf Iraq</p>
              <p>At least 40 protesters were killed in Iraq on Friday when
security forces used tear gas and an Iranian-backed militia
opened fire to try to quell renewed demonstrations against
corruption and economic hardship, security sources said.  A
government intelligence officer and a member of the powerful
Asaib Ahl al-Haq militia were killed in a clash with protesters
in the southern city of Amara, police sources said.</p>

infamous drug kingpin, who himself slipped away from authorities
on multiple occasions before being sentenced to life

              <p>British police were questioning the driver of a truck in
which 39 people, believed to be Chinese nationals, were found
dead this week as post-mortem examinations of some of the
victims began on Friday. The 25-year-old driver from Northern
Ireland was arrested on suspicion of murder after the grim
discovery of the bodies in the back of his refrigerated truck on
an industrial estate near London in the early hours of Wednesday
morning.</p>

              <p>British police said they had arrested two more people over
the deaths of 39 people found in a truck, believed to be Chinese
nationals, on suspicion of human trafficking and manslaughter. A
man and a woman, both aged 38, were arrested in Warrington,
northern England, Essex police said. The driver of the truck, a
25-year-old man from Northern Ireland, remains in police custody
having been arrested on suspicion of murder.</p>

              <p>Twenty-seven of 31 suspected cartel members arrested this
week in a Mexico City raid were freed by a judge, President
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday, marking his
government's second high-profile failure to keep suspected
criminals locked up in as many weeks. The suspects were nabbed
by security forces in a central district of the capital on
Tuesday after authorities seized two laboratories used to

precursors, more than two tons of marijuana and 20 kg of

              <p>As forensic experts began the process of identifying the victims, the Vietnamese embassy in London said families from the southeast Asian country had got in touch about missing relatives. There were growing concerns at least 10 of the victims could have been from Vietnam.</p>
              <p>Hoa Nghiem from Human Rights Space, a civic network based in Vietnam, said that Pham Thi Tra My, 26, had sent a text message to her mother saying she could not breathe at about the time the truck container was en route from Belgium to Britain.</p>

              <p>The victims - 31 men and eight women - are being moved to a hospital mortuary from a secure location at docks near the industrial estate in Grays about 20 miles (30 km) east of London where the bodies were found.</p>

GRAYS, England (Reuters) - Police investigating the deaths of 39 people in a truck near London said they had arrested three more suspects on Friday on suspicion of human trafficking amid signs that some of the dead may be Vietnamese.
As forensic experts began the process of identifying the victims, the Vietnamese embassy in London said families from the southeast Asian country had got in touch about missing relatives. There were growing concerns at least 10 of the victims could have been from Vietnam.
Hoa Nghiem from Human Rights Space, a civic network based in Vietnam, said that Pham Thi Tra My, 26, had sent a text message to her mother saying she could not breathe at about the time the truck container was en route from Belgium to Britain.
""I’m sorry, mum and dad. My path abroad was not a success. I love you both so much. I can’t breathe. I'm from Nghen Town, Can Loc District, Ha Tinh, Vietnam ... I am sorry, Mom,"" the message said, according to Hoa who told Reuters it had come from Tra My's family.
She said Tra My had gone to China and was planning to reach England via France and that the organization was getting more alerts about possible Vietnamese victims in the refrigerated trunk, which was found in the early hours of Wednesday.
Police have said they believe the dead were Chinese but Beijing said the nationalities had not yet been confirmed. Chinese and Vietnamese officials are now both working closely with British police, their respective embassies said.
""We owe it to those who have died to get this investigation right and speculation is not helpful,"" Essex Police's Deputy Chief Constable Pippa Mills told reporters. ""It may in fact hinder our investigation and its progress.""
She said they would not give any more details about the identities or nationalities of the victims until the formal identification process was complete.
Her officers were still questioning the 25-year-old truck driver on suspicion of murder following the discovery of the bodies in the back of his truck.
He has not been formally identified but a source familiar with the investigation named him as Mo Robinson from the Portadown area of Northern Ireland. 
On Friday, police also arrested a man and woman, both aged 38, in Warrington, northwest England, and a 48-year-old man from Northern Ireland at London's Stansted Airport. They are suspected of conspiracy to traffic people and manslaughter.
The victims - 31 men and eight women - are being moved to a hospital mortuary from a secure location at docks near the industrial estate in Grays about 20 miles (30 km) east of London where the bodies were found.
Post-mortem examinations were beginning to determine how exactly they died while the lengthy process of identifying the deceased was underway.
VietHome, an organization for the Vietnamese community in Britain, said it had received news from 10 families that their relatives were missing.
For years, illegal immigrants have attempted to reach Britain stowed away in trucks, often from the European mainland. In 2000, 58 Chinese were found dead in a tomato truck at the port of Dover.

BRITAIN 'HAS NOT FULFILLED RESPONSIBILITY'
""We hope that the British side can as soon as possible confirm and verify the identities of the victims, ascertain what happened and severely punish criminals involved in the case,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily news briefing.
China's Global Times, which is published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, said in a Friday editorial that Britain should bear some responsibility for the deaths.
""It is clear that Britain and relevant European countries have not fulfilled their responsibility to protect these people from such a death,"" the widely read tabloid said. 
It added that Britain appeared not to have learned its lesson from the Dover incident two decades ago.
The police investigation is focused on the movement of the trailer prior to its arrival at Purfleet docks near Grays little more than an hour before the bodies were found, and on who was behind the suspected human trafficking.
Irish company Global Trailer Rentals said it owned the trailer and had rented it out on Oct. 15. The firm said it was unaware of what it was to be used for.
The refrigeration unit had traveled to Britain from Zeebrugge in Belgium and the town's chairman, Dirk de Fauw, said he believed the victims died in the trailer before it arrived in the Belgian port.
The Times newspaper reported that GPS data showed the container had arrived at the Belgian port at 2.49 p.m. local time on Tuesday before later making the 10-hour sea crossing to Britain.
Police said the cab unit of the truck was driven over from Dublin on Sunday, crossing the Irish Sea by ship and entering Britain in North Wales. It picked up the trailer in Purfleet shortly after midnight on Wednesday.

By Peter Nicholls
GRAYS, England, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Police investigating the
deaths of 39 people in a truck near London said they had
arrested three more suspects on Friday on suspicion of human
trafficking amid signs that some of the dead may be Vietnamese.
As forensic experts began the process of identifying the
victims, the Vietnamese embassy in London said families from the
southeast Asian country had got in touch about missing
relatives. There were growing concerns at least 10 of the
victims could have been from Vietnam.
Hoa Nghiem from Human Rights Space, a civic network based in
Vietnam, said that Pham Thi Tra My, 26, had sent a text message
to her mother saying she could not breathe at about the time the
truck container was en route from Belgium to Britain.
""I’m sorry, mum and dad. My path abroad was not a success. I
love you both so much. I can’t breathe. I'm from Nghen Town, Can
Loc District, Ha Tinh, Vietnam ... I am sorry, Mom,"" the message
said, according to Hoa who told Reuters it had come from Tra
My's family.
She said Tra My had gone to China and was planning to reach
England via France and that the organisation was getting more
alerts about possible Vietnamese victims in the refrigerated
trunk, which was found in the early hours of Wednesday.
Police have said they believe the dead were Chinese but
Beijing said the nationalities had not yet been confirmed.
Chinese and Vietnamese officials are now both working closely
with British police, their respective embassies said.
""We owe it to those who have died to get this investigation
right and speculation is not helpful,"" Essex Police's Deputy
Chief Constable Pippa Mills told reporters. ""It may in fact
hinder our investigation and its progress.""
She said they would not give any more details about the
identities or nationalities of the victims until the formal
identification process was complete.
Her officers were still questioning the 25-year-old truck
driver on suspicion of murder following the discovery of the
bodies in the back of his truck.
He has not been formally identified but a source familiar
with the investigation named him as Mo Robinson from the
Portadown area of Northern Ireland.
On Friday, police also arrested a man and woman, both aged
38, in Warrington, northwest England, and a 48-year-old man from
Northern Ireland at London's Stansted Airport. They are
suspected of conspiracy to traffic people and manslaughter.
The victims - 31 men and eight women - are being moved to a
hospital mortuary from a secure location at docks near the
industrial estate in Grays about 20 miles (30 km) east of London
where the bodies were found.
Post-mortem examinations were beginning to determine how
exactly they died while the lengthy process of identifying the
deceased was underway.
VietHome, an organisation for the Vietnamese community in
Britain, said it had received news from 10 families that their
relatives were missing.
For years, illegal immigrants have attempted to reach
Britain stowed away in trucks, often from the European mainland.
In 2000, 58 Chinese were found dead in a tomato truck at the
port of Dover.

BRITAIN 'HAS NOT FULFILLED RESPONSIBILITY'
""We hope that the British side can as soon as possible
confirm and verify the identities of the victims, ascertain what
happened and severely punish criminals involved in the case,""
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily
news briefing.
China's Global Times, which is published by the ruling
Communist Party's official People's Daily, said in a Friday
editorial that Britain should bear some responsibility for the
deaths.
""It is clear that Britain and relevant European countries
have not fulfilled their responsibility to protect these people
from such a death,"" the widely read tabloid said.
It added that Britain appeared not to have learned its
lesson from the Dover incident two decades ago.
The police investigation is focused on the movement of the
trailer prior to its arrival at Purfleet docks near Grays little
more than an hour before the bodies were found, and on who was
behind the suspected human trafficking.
Irish company Global Trailer Rentals said it owned the
trailer and had rented it out on Oct. 15. The firm said it was
unaware of what it was to be used for.
The refrigeration unit had travelled to Britain from
Zeebrugge in Belgium and the town's chairman, Dirk de Fauw, said

the Belgian port.
The Times newspaper reported that GPS data showed the

stigma is rife and gay sex remains illegal.</p>
              <p>Now gay rights activist Melusi Simelane plans to go further

common-law offence, which is a hangover of colonisation,""
Simelane told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on the sidelines of

              <p>It gained independence from Britain in September 1968 and is
among a number of African countries to retain colonial-era laws

              <p>Conservative attitudes against LGBT+ people are widespread
in eSwatini. The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and

pervasive discrimination and violence.</p>
              <p>Stigma and prejudice are ""rampant"", said Simelane, ranging

no legal protection from discrimination for LGBT+ people.</p>

              <p>KATHMANDU, Oct 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A Nepali
woman who was gang raped as a child finally saw her attackers
convicted this week after a years-long legal battle that took
her to the country's highest court, but said she was still
waiting for compensation for her ordeal.</p>
              <p>Pooja Bohara was dragged into a bathroom and raped in 2012
when she was 14, a case that made headlines and triggered anger
across the Himalayan nation.</p>
              <p>On Thursday, the Supreme Court found two men guilty of gang
rape, four years after a lower court acquitted them citing a
lack of evidence.</p>
              <p>The two men now face a jail sentence of up to 19 years, but
Bohara, who was stigmatised and was ostracised even by some of
her own relatives after she reported the attack, said that did
not amount to justice.</p>
              <p>""Does just sending two men to jail mean justice to me?"" she
said in a brief telephone interview with the Thomson Reuters
Foundation. ""I should also get compensation.""</p>
              <p>Bohara left her village in remote western Nepal after the
attack and was given shelter by the charity Raksha Nepal, which
helps sexually exploited girls and women.</p>
              <p>Since then she has embarked on a law degree, saying she
wanted to become a judge to help other victims get justice, and
is now in her final year.</p>
              <p>Menuka Thapa, who heads Raksha Nepal, said Bohara was
granted compensation after her attackers were convicted for the
first time, but the payment got held up by their appeal.</p>
              <p>She welcomed the Supreme Court verdict, saying it showed
there was ""rule of law"" in Nepal.</p>
              <p>""This has raised hopes that even poor and ordinary victims
like Pooja can get justice,"" said Thapa.</p>
              <p>An average of three rapes is reported in Nepal every day,
but the real number is likely much higher, according to Human
Rights Watch.</p>
              <p>In recent years greater media attention, protests by civil
society groups and changes in some government policies have
helped embolden women and raise awareness about their rights,
say campaigners.</p>
              <p>Earlier this month, Nepal's parliament speaker resigned to
allow an investigation into a rape accusation against him.</p>
              <p>Yet the conviction rate for crimes against women remains low
at about 5% as many victims do not testify for fear of the
stigma associated with rape, said Thapa of Raksha Nepal.

KATHMANDU, Oct 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A Nepali
woman who was gang raped as a child finally saw her attackers
convicted this week after a years-long legal battle that took
her to the country's highest court, but said she was still
waiting for compensation for her ordeal.
Pooja Bohara was dragged into a bathroom and raped in 2012
when she was 14, a case that made headlines and triggered anger
across the Himalayan nation.
On Thursday, the Supreme Court found two men guilty of gang
rape, four years after a lower court acquitted them citing a
lack of evidence.
The two men now face a jail sentence of up to 19 years, but
Bohara, who was stigmatised and was ostracised even by some of
her own relatives after she reported the attack, said that did
not amount to justice.
""Does just sending two men to jail mean justice to me?"" she
said in a brief telephone interview with the Thomson Reuters
Foundation. ""I should also get compensation.""
Bohara left her village in remote western Nepal after the
attack and was given shelter by the charity Raksha Nepal, which
helps sexually exploited girls and women.
Since then she has embarked on a law degree, saying she
wanted to become a judge to help other victims get justice, and
is now in her final year.
Menuka Thapa, who heads Raksha Nepal, said Bohara was
granted compensation after her attackers were convicted for the
first time, but the payment got held up by their appeal.
She welcomed the Supreme Court verdict, saying it showed
there was ""rule of law"" in Nepal.
""This has raised hopes that even poor and ordinary victims
like Pooja can get justice,"" said Thapa.
An average of three rapes is reported in Nepal every day,
but the real number is likely much higher, according to Human
Rights Watch.
In recent years greater media attention, protests by civil
society groups and changes in some government policies have
helped embolden women and raise awareness about their rights,
say campaigners.
Earlier this month, Nepal's parliament speaker resigned to
allow an investigation into a rape accusation against him.
Yet the conviction rate for crimes against women remains low
at about 5% as many victims do not testify for fear of the
stigma associated with rape, said Thapa of Raksha Nepal.

              <p>South Africa’s power generation is dominated by coal, which

              <p>With electricity power cuts returning in October to South
African cities due to technical faults, Energy Minister Gwede

generation over the next decade with a mix of renewable energy

              <p>According to government's Integrated Resource Plan released
this month, by 2030 coal would account for 59% of electricity,
with another 8% coming from hydropower, 6% from solar power, 18%
from wind and 1% from gas and diesel.</p>
              <p>For now coal is taking a heavy toll in the communities

              <p>In August, a Greenpeace-funded study using NASA satellite

mine blasting sent cracks through the walls of their homes. Some
were given government housing, he said.</p>
              <p>Paul also climbed underground into abandoned mines where

mining to extract and sell pieces of coal to survive, he said.</p>

              <p>HARARE, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Supporters of the Zimbabwe
government marched in the capital on Friday denouncing Western
sanctions that President Emmerson Mnangagwa says have sapped the
economy, but his opponents stayed away, accusing him of trying
to distract attention from his failings.</p>
              <p>Mnangagwa has struggled to unify the country since taking
over from the late Robert Mugabe, ousted in a coup in 2017.</p>
              <p>Hopes of swift recovery have faded as the economy grapples
with its worst crisis in a decade, marked by 18-hour daily power
cuts and shortages of foreign exchange, fuel and medicines.</p>
              <p>Mnangagwa, like Mugabe, blames sanctions imposed by the

* Government says Western sanctions behind economic crisis
* Zimbabwe should tackle corruption, reforms, West says
* Mnangagwa declares public holiday for anti-sanction march
By MacDonald Dzirutwe
HARARE, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Supporters of the Zimbabwe
government marched in the capital on Friday denouncing Western
sanctions that President Emmerson Mnangagwa says have sapped the
economy, but his opponents stayed away, accusing him of trying
to distract attention from his failings.
Mnangagwa has struggled to unify the country since taking
over from the late Robert Mugabe, ousted in a coup in 2017.
Hopes of swift recovery have faded as the economy grapples
with its worst crisis in a decade, marked by 18-hour daily power
cuts and shortages of foreign exchange, fuel and medicines.
Mnangagwa, like Mugabe, blames sanctions imposed by the
United States and European Union nearly two decades ago for the
country's economic ills.
Led by Mnangagwa's wife Auxillia, about 7,000 government
supporters bussed from across Zimbabwe marched for 5 km to the
national stadium in Harare.
Singing and dancing, they waved placards inscribed ""No
sanctions, no discrimination, sanctions new version of slavery,""
and ""Enough is enough, remove sanctions now.""
""We have no jobs because of the sanctions. America wants to
remove ZANU-PF from power through sanctions but we will defend
the party and our president,"" said 32-year-old Martin Mafusire.
Mnangagwa declared Friday a public holiday and was expected
to address the marchers at the stadium, where a soccer match
between Zimbabwe's biggest teams was due to be followed by a
concert.
The EU and United States imposed financial and travel bans
on ZANU-PF and top military figures from 2001 for alleged human
rights abuses and electoral fraud. The government says the
measures are punishment for its seizures of white-owned farms.
ZANU-PF supporters condemn the sanctions while the main
opposition Movement for Democratic Change says they are not the
cause of the country's economic crisis.
The regional Southern African Development Community has
rallied behind Zimbabwe's call for an end to sanctions.
While the government ran documentaries and articles in the
official press criticising sanctions, the U.S. and EU embassies
took to social media to rebut the official narrative.
U.S. Ambassador Brian Nichols wrote an article in a private
newspaper on Thursday saying ""the greatest sanctions on Zimbabwe
are the limitations that the country places on itself"".
He said the United States remained the biggest donor to
Zimbabwe but corruption and lack of reform had dragged down the
economy.
The EU now only keeps sanctions on Mugabe and his wife Grace
and Zimbabwe Defence Industries.
Harare says the U.S. sanctions have been the most
devastating. These bar U.S. officials at the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank from voting for debt relief or
fresh lending for Zimbabwe.
In March, President Donald Trump extended by one year
sanctions against 141 entities and individuals in Zimbabwe,
including Mnangagwa.

island attracted 2 million visitors the previous year but has
now limited numbers to 19,000 per day and banned beach parties,
smoking and drinking.</p>

              <p>3. MOUNT EVEREST BASE CAMP, CHINA: The Chinese government
closed its side of the Everest base camp this year to anyone
without a climbing permit due to the huge amounts of rubbish
piling up at the site, according to the Lonely Planet travel
website. The Chinese base camp, located in Tibet, was accessible
by car.</p>

              <p>GRAYS, England, Oct 25 (Reuters) - British police were
questioning the driver of a truck in which 39 people, believed
to be Chinese nationals, were found dead this week as
post-mortem examinations of some of the victims began on Friday.</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old driver from Northern Ireland was arrested on
suspicion of murder after the grim discovery of the bodies in
the back of his refrigerated truck on an industrial estate near
London in the early hours of Wednesday morning.</p>
              <p>He has not been formally identified but a source familiar
with the investigation said he was Mo Robinson from the
Portadown area of the British province. Detectives will decide
later whether to charge him with an offence, release him or ask
a court for more time to quiz him.</p>
              <p>Late on Thursday, British authorities moved 11 of the
victims - 31 men and eight women - to a hospital mortuary from a
secure location at docks near to the industrial estate in Grays
about 20 miles (30 km) east of London where the bodies were
found.</p>
              <p>Police have said the process of identifying those who died
would take some time while autopsies were carried out to
determine how exactly they died.</p>
              <p>""This is the largest investigation of its kind Essex Police
has ever had to conduct and it is likely to take some
considerable time to come to a conclusion,"" Essex Chief
Constable Ben-Julian Harrington said.</p>
              <p>His force has said their priority was ensuring respect and
compassion for the victims. The Chinese Embassy in London said
it had sent a team to Essex to meet with local police.</p>
              <p>The focus of the police investigation is on the movement of
the trailer prior to its arrival at Purfleet docks near Grays
little more than an hour before the bodies were found and who
was behind the suspected human trafficking.</p>
              <p>Irish company Global Trailer Rentals said it owned the
trailer and had rented it out on Oct. 15. The firm said it was
unaware of what it was to be used for.</p>
              <p>The refrigeration unit had travelled to Britain from
Zeebrugge in Belgium and the town's chairman, Dirk de Fauw, said
he believed the victims died in the trailer before it arrived
there.</p>
              <p>""We have a safe system with safety guards, we have cameras
everywhere, we have policemen in the streets of Zeebrugge, in
the dunes with horses,"" de Fauw, who is also mayor of the nearby
city of Bruges, told Reuters Television.</p>
              <p>The Times newspaper reported that GPS data showed the
container had arrived at the Belgian port at 2.49 p.m. local
time on Tuesday before later making the 10-hour trip to Britain.</p>
              <p>Police said the cab unit of the truck was driven over from
Dublin on Sunday, entering Britain in North Wales. It picked up
the trailer in Purfleet shortly after midnight on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>For years, illegal immigrants have attempted to reach
Britain stowed away in trucks, often from the European mainland.
In 2000, 58 Chinese were found dead in a tomato truck at the
port of Dover. They had travelled to Britain from Zeebrugge.</p>
              <p>The National Crime Agency, which targets serious and
organised crime, said it was helping the investigation and
working urgently to identify any gangs involved.</p>
              <p>The head of the Road Haulage Association said traffickers
were ""upping their game"" and closer cooperation with European
nations was needed, although that may be complicated by
Britain's potential exit from the European Union.

GRAYS, England, Oct 25 (Reuters) - British police were
questioning the driver of a truck in which 39 people, believed
to be Chinese nationals, were found dead this week as
post-mortem examinations of some of the victims began on Friday.
The 25-year-old driver from Northern Ireland was arrested on
suspicion of murder after the grim discovery of the bodies in
the back of his refrigerated truck on an industrial estate near
London in the early hours of Wednesday morning.
He has not been formally identified but a source familiar
with the investigation said he was Mo Robinson from the
Portadown area of the British province. Detectives will decide
later whether to charge him with an offence, release him or ask
a court for more time to quiz him.
Late on Thursday, British authorities moved 11 of the
victims - 31 men and eight women - to a hospital mortuary from a
secure location at docks near to the industrial estate in Grays
about 20 miles (30 km) east of London where the bodies were
found.
Police have said the process of identifying those who died
would take some time while autopsies were carried out to
determine how exactly they died.
""This is the largest investigation of its kind Essex Police
has ever had to conduct and it is likely to take some
considerable time to come to a conclusion,"" Essex Chief
Constable Ben-Julian Harrington said.
His force has said their priority was ensuring respect and
compassion for the victims. The Chinese Embassy in London said
it had sent a team to Essex to meet with local police.
The focus of the police investigation is on the movement of
the trailer prior to its arrival at Purfleet docks near Grays
little more than an hour before the bodies were found and who
was behind the suspected human trafficking.
Irish company Global Trailer Rentals said it owned the
trailer and had rented it out on Oct. 15. The firm said it was
unaware of what it was to be used for.
The refrigeration unit had travelled to Britain from
Zeebrugge in Belgium and the town's chairman, Dirk de Fauw, said
he believed the victims died in the trailer before it arrived
there.
""We have a safe system with safety guards, we have cameras
everywhere, we have policemen in the streets of Zeebrugge, in
the dunes with horses,"" de Fauw, who is also mayor of the nearby
city of Bruges, told Reuters Television.
The Times newspaper reported that GPS data showed the
container had arrived at the Belgian port at 2.49 p.m. local
time on Tuesday before later making the 10-hour trip to Britain.
Police said the cab unit of the truck was driven over from
Dublin on Sunday, entering Britain in North Wales. It picked up
the trailer in Purfleet shortly after midnight on Wednesday.
For years, illegal immigrants have attempted to reach
Britain stowed away in trucks, often from the European mainland.
In 2000, 58 Chinese were found dead in a tomato truck at the
port of Dover. They had travelled to Britain from Zeebrugge.
The National Crime Agency, which targets serious and
organised crime, said it was helping the investigation and
working urgently to identify any gangs involved.
The head of the Road Haulage Association said traffickers
were ""upping their game"" and closer cooperation with European
nations was needed, although that may be complicated by
Britain's potential exit from the European Union.

              <p>SAHEL SELIM, Egypt, Oct 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -
In a small village 45 minutes from the city of Assiut, in
southern Egypt, a group of farmers and their families gathered
to watch a theatre performance that aimed to find the funny side
of climate change.
The hour-long comedy, which has so far been performed in 50
villages in the Upper Egypt region, in the country's south,
tells the story of a farmer who refuses to pay for a new, more
water-efficient agricultural canal.</p>
              <p>When a snake bites him and he is thought to be dead, the
farmer hears how much his family and neighbours hated him
because he rejected modern farming methods. At the end of the
show, he changes his perspective.</p>
              <p>The play is part of a $7-million project funded by the World
Food Programme (WFP) and managed by the Egyptian Ministry of
Agriculture that aims to help farmers in the region cope better
with climate change threats through modern technology,
sustainable growing techniques and better understanding of
climate issues.</p>
              <p>Organisers say the project, which started in 2013 and is
scheduled to end early next year, has boosted the production of
some major crops by at least a third and drastically cut water
consumption on the farms involved.</p>
              <p>It is one in a series of efforts the Egyptian government has
made over the past decade to limit the negative impact of
climate change on farmers across the country.</p>
              <p>""Community mobilisation on the issue of climate change can
encourage many people to embrace the ideas of the project. And
theatre is one of the methods to mobilise the community,"" said
Ayam Abu el-Hagag, an actor in the traveling troupe and also an
agricultural advisor.</p>
              <p>He noted that each time the troupe delivers a joke on stage,
the characters explain the information to make it accessible to
all farmers, even those with little or no formal education.</p>
              <p>""Comedy helps people understand things easier,"" he added.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>HIGHLY VULNERABLE</p>
              <p>Climate change has been a major challenge for Egypt and
according to the WFP, ""southern Egypt is one of the areas most
vulnerable to climate change within the region"".</p>
              <p>Environmental groups regard Egypt as one of the countries
most threatened by the negative effects of climate change, which
include sea-level rise, water poverty, and deteriorating public
health and ecosystems.
The WFP forecasts that Upper Egypt could lose up to 30% of
its food production by 2050 as climate change brings more
extreme weather and other threats.</p>
              <p>Saber Osman, director of the climate change adaptation
department at Egypt's Ministry of Environment, told the Thomson
Reuters Foundation that losses could lead to a major crisis for
Egypt's farming sector.</p>
              <p>Agriculture represents almost 15% of the country's gross
domestic product and employs about a third of the workforce, he
said.</p>
              <p>The idea behind the WFP project is to get farmers involved
in the frontline fight against climate change and stamp out bad
farming habits, said the project's director, Othman el-Sheikh.</p>
              <p>That includes encouraging farmers to plant crop varieties
that require less water and to follow new irrigation methods to
reduce water consumption.</p>
              <p>Farmers also learn how to combine traditional farming
techniques with more modern technology, such as solar-powered
irrigation pumps and an app that alerts farmers to incoming
weather events.</p>
              <p>One main focus for the project is to help farmers work
together, to cut the cost of seeds by buying them in bulk and
planting them across several neighbouring farms, el-Sheikh
explained.</p>
              <p>""Fragmented agricultural holdings are common throughout
Egypt in general and in Upper Egypt in particular,"" he said.</p>
              <p>When they work independently, many farmers cannot afford to
access high-quality resources, which lowers their productivity
and leads to about 10% of land lying fallow, he added.</p>
              <p>The initiative helps farmers organise into groups of at
least 70, who agree to pool their resources.</p>
              <p>Every planting season, the Society Development Association
in Sahel Selim, which is working with the WFP on the project,
buys enough seed for all 70 farmers and divides the seeds
equally among them.</p>
              <p>The farmers carry out the sowing and eventual harvesting
together, cutting costs by sharing equipment and manpower,
el-Sheikh explained.</p>
              <p>The hope is that once the project ends, the farmer groups
will be making enough revenue to allow them to buy high-quality
seeds for themselves, he said.</p>
              <p>El-Sheikh added that almost 2,000 farms have been
consolidated into larger farming groups through the project in
the past three years.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE</p>
              <p>The WFP project also runs a loan program that provides
villagers with goats and ducks to give them an alternative
source of income in case their crops fail.</p>
              <p>Sabrine Haridi, a 33-year-old mother of four children in
Sahel Selim, said she got a loan to acquire 38 ducks, which
allow her to cover the family's expenses, even in seasons when
her husband's wheat harvest falls short.</p>
              <p>She sells some of the ducks for their meat and rears more
from eggs, selling them when they mature. Any profit she makes
goes toward paying off the loan.</p>
              <p>""Two years ago, I was desperate because my husband could not
afford our daily needs. I am now financially independent,"" she
told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p>""When my husband fails to get the expected money from his
crop due to climate change, I pay for whatever we need,
including food, clothes and school expenses,"" she added.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>'IN GOD'S HANDS'</p>
              <p>Since the project was launched in Egypt in 2013, half a
million farmers have become involved, said el-Sheikh</p>
              <p>He told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that applying the new
methods has increased wheat production by 30% to 40%, boosted
sugarcane output by about 30% and reduced water consumption by a
third.</p>
              <p>But getting to that point was not easy, said Osman at the
environment ministry.</p>
              <p>""Community resistance to adopting methods for coping with
climate change is common in Egyptian villages,"" he said, adding
that some farmers do not see climate change as an issue that can
be addressed because it is ""in God's hands"".</p>
              <p>El-Sheikh said that some farmers used to ask him, ""What
would you do to combat climate change? Would you change God's
weather?""</p>
              <p>He told them the efforts only aimed to help farmers cope
with changing weather, not shift the weather itself.</p>
              <p>""Convincing farmers to use modern technology and advanced
agricultural means, as well as encouraging women to take part in
the project, are some of the biggest challenges we face,"" El
Sheikh added.</p>
              <p>Hassan Bekheet, 53, said he didn't need much convincing to
swap his maize crops for drought-tolerant sorghum when he joined
the project in Sahel Selim.</p>
              <p>Once he made the switch, his crop yield increased by about
25%, as did his revenues, he said, while his costs went down by
15%.

neighbours.

BANGKOK, Oct 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Almost 2,000
informal settlements in Delhi are set to be legalised under a
new law agreed by the government this week, which ministers said
would give more than 4 million residents the right to own their
homes in India's capital.
India's cabinet this week passed a bill to regularise 1,797
unauthorised slums in the country's most populous city, giving
residents ownership rights at ""minimal rates"" that would enable
them to build and sell properties and take loans.
Mapping is to begin shortly, according to a statement from
the ministry of housing and urban affairs, with the bill due to
be presented for passage during the next session of parliament
from mid-November.
""It will transform the lives of more than 40 lakh (4
million) residents who came to Delhi in search of a better life
and livelihood but were forced to live in squalor,"" said Housing
Minister Hardeep Singh Puri.
""Besides providing a legitimate claim to the property, the
decision will encourage property holders to invest in safe
structures, thereby improving living conditions in these
colonies substantially,"" he said at a press briefing this week.
The plan to regularise Delhi's unauthorised settlements had
been floated for more than a decade. Earlier this year, the
Delhi government said it would study about 1,700 such
settlements and consider a plan to legalise them.
Most inhabitants are migrant workers from other parts of
India who cannot afford regular housing in the city of more than
18 million people.
Authorities have built roads and drains in some settlements,
but many lack basic facilities and residents face the constant
threat of eviction, according to housing rights activists.
Under the proposed law, authorities will map the boundaries
of the slum areas, and prepare a plan. Residents will have to
provide basic documentation and pay a nominal charge to register
their property and receive the title, Puri said.
""It will pave the way for incentivised planned urbanisation,
and transform urban squalor into modern urban spaces with modern
amenities. Work will start immediately,"" he said.
Worldwide, about 1 billion people live in slums and informal
settlements. By 2030, 3 billion people will lack access to
adequate and affordable housing, according to UN-Habitat, the
United Nations' settlements agency.
Regularising Delhi's unauthorised colonies has been a
campaign promise of many political parties, and this week's
announcement comes months ahead of a local election that must be
held by February next year.
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the federal
government had declined to act on the city's earlier proposal

general election on Dec. 12 to break Britain's Brexit impasse,
conceding for the first time he will not meet his ""do or die""

Turkey on Thursday of launching a large land offensive targeting
three villages in northeast Syria despite a truce, but Russia
said a peace plan hammered out this week was going ahead

deadline to leave the European Union next week. Johnson said in
a letter to opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn he would give
parliament more time to approve his Brexit deal but lawmakers
must back a December election, Johnson's third attempt to try to
force a snap vote.
Russia's Lavrov says Norwegian spy could return home at 'any
moment'
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that a Norwegian
man jailed for spying could return home at ""any moment"". Lavrov
spoke briefly to Norwegian media when he arrived in the Arctic
town of Kirkenes in Norway on the 75th anniversary of its
liberation by the Red Army, according to video posted on Friday
on the Russian foreign ministry's Telegram channel.
Police say 39 dead in truck near London believed to be
Chinese
Police were given more time on Thursday to question a driver
arrested on suspicion of murder after 39 people, believed to be
Chinese nationals, were found dead in a refrigerated truck near
London, with the investigation focusing on human trafficking.
Officers searched three properties in the County Armagh area of
Northern Ireland. The driver has not been formally identified
but a source familiar with the investigation said he was Mo
Robinson from the Portadown area of the British province.
Tourists line up to scale Australia's Uluru hours ahead of
climb ban
Hundreds of tourists formed long queues to climb Australia's
Uluru soon after dawn on Friday, the day before a permanent ban
on the climb takes effect following a decades-long fight by
indigenous people to close the trek. Blustery conditions meant
visitors were stopped from making an early morning climb and
authorities said they will reassess during the day whether or
not to reopen.
Syrian Kurds accuse Turkey of violations, Russia says peace
plan on track
The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) accused
Turkey on Thursday of launching a large land offensive targeting
three villages in northeast Syria despite a truce, but Russia
said a peace plan hammered out this week was going ahead
smoothly. Under the plan, agreed by Presidents Tayyip Erdogan
and Vladimir Putin, Syrian Kurdish forces are to withdraw more
than 30 km (19 miles) from the Turkish border, a goal Russia's
RIA news agency, quoting an SDF official, said was already
achieved.
Iraqi PM warns against violence on eve on planned
anti-government protests
Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said on Thursday
people would be free to exercise their right to demonstrate at
imminent anti-government protests, but warned violence would not
be tolerated. Protesters had begun to gather in public squares
in Baghdad and southern provinces as Abdul Mahdi made his
televised address, ahead of officially sanctioned protests on
Friday.
Lebanon's Aoun invites protesters to talk, hints at
government reshuffle
Lebanese President Michel Aoun said on Thursday he was ready
for a dialogue with protesters to help save the country from
collapse after days of demonstrations against the ruling elite,
and he suggested a government reshuffle was possible. Protests
fueled by worsening economic conditions have paralyzed the
country and kept banks shut. Lebanon's banking association said
it would keep lenders closed on Friday for a seventh consecutive
working day, citing safety concerns.
Chile says 'no chance' of riots derailing APEC, U.N. climate
meet in Santiago
Chile, grappling with violent protests that rocked the
capital Santiago for days, will not let the riots derail plans
to host two major global meetings in coming months, Foreign
Minister Teodoro Ribera said on Thursday. He said that there was
""no chance"" of calling off the Nov. 16-17 Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) summit or the United Nations climate change
conference COP25 in December."

              <p>By Rachel Savage</p>
              <p>LONDON, Oct 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The creator of
the first mainstream American children's animated series to
feature a lesbian wedding has said she had to battle for years
to include it in her show, which has been censored in multiple
countries.</p>
              <p>Animator Rebecca Sugar said her show ""Steven Universe"",
which airs on the Cartoon Network, was a way for her to support
children who felt ""alienated"" by gender stereotypes in
traditional cartoons - as she herself did.</p>
              <p>The show's hero, Steven, is a half-human boy raised by three
aliens who take on feminine forms and help him to save humanity,
and it made history last year when two of the aliens - known as
Crystal Gems - were married.</p>
              <p>That took years of work because of sensitivities around
LGBT+ content in programmes aimed at children, which often have
to work for a global market, said Sugar, 32, who is bisexual.</p>
              <p>""We are held to standards of extremely bigoted countries. It
took several years of fighting internally to get the wedding to
happen,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.</p>
              <p>""There are people who see what we're doing as insidious and
... they're ignorant.</p>
              <p>""So much bigotry is based on the idea that (LGBT+ content)
is something inherently adult, which is entirely false.""</p>
              <p/>
              <p>'WHIPLASH'</p>
              <p>Cartoons aimed at teenagers and adults, such as ""The
Simpsons"" and ""Family Guy"", have had LGBT+ characters since the
mid-2000s, but it took longer for children's shows.</p>
              <p>Since ""Steven Universe"" began in 2013 other shows with a
young audience to have included LGBT+ themes include ""Arthur"",
which has featured a gay wedding, and ""Adventure Time"", which
Sugar previously worked on and which has shown a lesbian kiss.</p>
              <p>Sugar recalled the frustration of not being able to be open
about her personal experiences in the early years of her career
before she made her sexuality public.</p>
              <p>""It was also difficult for me as a bisexual person whose own
queer experience was so delegitimised over the course of my
life. I couldn't even say that this was true for me,"" said
Sugar, who came out on stage at a Comic-Con conference in 2016.</p>
              <p>""Everyone at the studio supported me in that choice and my
staff, and from that point on … (I've felt) so much more solid
in my own life.""</p>
              <p>Sugar mostly identifies as non-binary - neither male nor
female. She used the term ""gender expansive"" to describe
herself, and said she only sometimes identified as female - a
fluidity reflected in her cartoon characters</p>
              <p>Making the show also taught her that mental health problems
were disproportionately high among LGBT+ people, who tell her at
conventions that they identify with her writing, said Sugar.</p>
              <p>""I had no idea that the types of social anxiety that I
experienced are very common.""</p>
              <p>Today the mood in the industry has shifted so
comprehensively that the makers of ""Steven Universe"" sell
LGBT-themed merchandise - a development Sugar is ambivalent
about, describing her sense of ""whiplash"" at the speed of
change.</p>
              <p>Despite such progress in the media, Sugar said LGBT+ rights
were under threat globally.</p>
              <p>""Right now what is so critical is just that queer youth

By Rachel Savage
LONDON, Oct 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The creator of
the first mainstream American children's animated series to
feature a lesbian wedding has said she had to battle for years
to include it in her show, which has been censored in multiple
countries.
Animator Rebecca Sugar said her show ""Steven Universe"",
which airs on the Cartoon Network, was a way for her to support
children who felt ""alienated"" by gender stereotypes in
traditional cartoons - as she herself did.
The show's hero, Steven, is a half-human boy raised by three
aliens who take on feminine forms and help him to save humanity,
and it made history last year when two of the aliens - known as
Crystal Gems - were married.
That took years of work because of sensitivities around
LGBT+ content in programmes aimed at children, which often have
to work for a global market, said Sugar, 32, who is bisexual.
""We are held to standards of extremely bigoted countries. It
took several years of fighting internally to get the wedding to
happen,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.
""There are people who see what we're doing as insidious and
... they're ignorant.
""So much bigotry is based on the idea that (LGBT+ content)
is something inherently adult, which is entirely false.""

'WHIPLASH'
Cartoons aimed at teenagers and adults, such as ""The
Simpsons"" and ""Family Guy"", have had LGBT+ characters since the
mid-2000s, but it took longer for children's shows.
Since ""Steven Universe"" began in 2013 other shows with a
young audience to have included LGBT+ themes include ""Arthur"",
which has featured a gay wedding, and ""Adventure Time"", which
Sugar previously worked on and which has shown a lesbian kiss.
Sugar recalled the frustration of not being able to be open
about her personal experiences in the early years of her career
before she made her sexuality public.
""It was also difficult for me as a bisexual person whose own
queer experience was so delegitimised over the course of my
life. I couldn't even say that this was true for me,"" said
Sugar, who came out on stage at a Comic-Con conference in 2016.
""Everyone at the studio supported me in that choice and my
staff, and from that point on … (I've felt) so much more solid
in my own life.""
Sugar mostly identifies as non-binary - neither male nor
female. She used the term ""gender expansive"" to describe
herself, and said she only sometimes identified as female - a
fluidity reflected in her cartoon characters
Making the show also taught her that mental health problems
were disproportionately high among LGBT+ people, who tell her at
conventions that they identify with her writing, said Sugar.
""I had no idea that the types of social anxiety that I
experienced are very common.""
Today the mood in the industry has shifted so
comprehensively that the makers of ""Steven Universe"" sell
LGBT-themed merchandise - a development Sugar is ambivalent
about, describing her sense of ""whiplash"" at the speed of
change.
Despite such progress in the media, Sugar said LGBT+ rights
were under threat globally.
""Right now what is so critical is just that queer youth
understand adults in the world know they exist, appreciate they
exist,"" she said.
""I really hope the show is a stepping stone to action and to
the ability to find one another.""

GRAYS, England, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Police were given more

DIGNITY
The trailer part of the truck arrived at Purfleet docks in
Essex from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge - as did the vehicle
involved in 2000.
The chairman of Zeebrugge, Dirk de Fauw, said he believed
the victims died in the trailer before it arrived there.
""We have a safe system with safety guards, we have cameras

the dunes with horses,"" de Fauw, who is also mayor of the nearby

""I think they were dead before they are coming here to

The truck's red cab unit, which had ""Ireland"" emblazoned on
the windscreen along with the message ""The Ultimate Dream"",
entered Britain via Holyhead in north Wales, having started its
journey in Dublin, police said.
Irish company Global Trailer Rentals said it owned the
trailer and had rented it out on Oct. 15 from its depot in
County Monaghan at a rate of 275 euros ($305) a week, Irish
broadcaster RTE said. The firm said it was unaware of what it
was to be used for, RTE added.
The discovery of the bodies was made at 1.40 a.m. just over

              <p>Oct 24 (Reuters) - The largest field of Democratic
presidential candidates in the modern U.S. political era got a
bit smaller on Thursday when U.S. Representative Tim Ryan
dropped out of the race, after failing to gain traction in
opinion polls.</p>
              <p>Ryan, 46, a moderate from a blue-collar district in
northeastern Ohio, is the latest Democrat to end a bid for the
party's nomination to take on President Donald Trump, the likely
Republican nominee, in the November 2020 election.</p>
              <p>Eighteen Democrats are still vying for the nomination, and
three Republicans are making a long-shot challenge to Trump's
renomination. The latest to enter the Republican race is former
U.S. Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina, who
announced his bid on Sept. 8.</p>
              <p>The diverse group of Democrats includes six U.S. senators. A
record five women are running, as well as black, Hispanic, Asian
and openly gay candidates who would make history if one of them
becomes the party's nominee.</p>
              <p>A top tier of contenders has emerged from the crowded field,
while others are still trying to break through. (Here is a
graphic https://tmsnrt.rs/2UhJ7WE of the Republican and
Democratic presidential fields.)</p>
              <p>DEMOCRATIC TOP TIER</p>
              <p>Here are the Democrats who are ranked in the top five in
Reuters/Ipsos polling:</p>
              <p/>
              <p>JOE BIDEN</p>
              <p>Biden, the early front-runner in opinion polls among
Democratic presidential contenders, waited until late April to
enter the race, launching his bid with a direct swipe at Trump.
Biden, 76, served eight years as President Barack Obama's vice
president and 36 years in the U.S. Senate. He stands at the
center of the Democratic debate over whether the party's
standard-bearer should be a veteran politician or a newcomer,
and whether a liberal or a moderate has a better chance of
defeating Trump. Biden, who frequently notes his ""Middle-Class
Joe"" nickname, touts his working-class roots and ability to work
in a bipartisan fashion. He has faced criticism from some fellow
Democrats for his role in passing tough-on-crime legislation in
the 1990s.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>ELIZABETH WARREN</p>
              <p>The 70-year-old U.S. senator from Massachusetts is a leader
of the party's liberals and a fierce critic of Wall Street who
was instrumental in creating the federal Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau (CFPB) after the 2008 financial crisis. Her
campaign has surged in recent weeks, tying or leading Biden in
some polls. She has focused her presidential campaign on a
populist economic message, promising to fight what she calls a
rigged system that favors the wealthy. She has released an array
of policy proposals on everything from breaking up big tech
companies to implementing a ""wealth tax"" on the richest
Americans. Warren has sworn off political fundraising events to
back her campaign.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>BERNIE SANDERS</p>
              <p>The U.S. senator from Vermont lost the Democratic nomination
in 2016 to Hillary Clinton but is trying again. For the 2020
race, Sanders, 78, is fighting to stand out in a field of
progressives running on issues he brought into the Democratic
Party mainstream four years ago.</p>
              <p>Sanders suffered a heart attack while campaigning in Nevada
in October, but there has been little impact so far on his
support.</p>
              <p>His proposals include free tuition at public colleges, a
$15-an-hour minimum wage and universal healthcare. He benefits
from strong name recognition and an unmatched network of
small-dollar donors.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>PETE BUTTIGIEG</p>
              <p>The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, emerged from
virtual anonymity to become one of the party's brightest stars,
building momentum with young voters. A Harvard University
graduate and Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford, he
speaks seven languages conversationally and served in
Afghanistan with the U.S. Navy Reserve. He touts himself as
representing a new generation of leadership needed to combat
Trump. Buttigieg would be the first openly gay presidential
nominee of a major American political party.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>KAMALA HARRIS</p>
              <p>The first-term U.S. senator from California would make
history as the first black woman to gain the nomination. Harris,
55, the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, announced
her candidacy on the holiday honoring slain civil rights leader
Martin Luther King Jr. She supports a middle-class tax credit,
the Green New Deal and marijuana legalization. Her track record
as San Francisco's district attorney and California's attorney
general has drawn scrutiny in a Democratic Party that has grown
more liberal in recent years on criminal justice issues. She saw
a significant bounce in the polls after a high-profile clash
with Biden over race issues during the first Democratic debate
in June but has since seen her numbers drop back down.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>TRYING TO BREAK THROUGH</p>
              <p>The field also includes many Democrats who are looking for a
way to break through. Some hold public office and managed to
generate an early fundraising base, while others are still
trying to raise their profiles.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>ANDREW YANG</p>
              <p>The entrepreneur and former tech executive is focusing his
campaign on an ambitious universal income plan. Yang, 44, wants
to guarantee all Americans between the ages of 18 and 64 a
$1,000 check every month. The son of immigrants from Taiwan,
Yang supports the Medicare for All proposal, which is based on
the existing government-run Medicare program for Americans 65
and older, and has warned that automation is the biggest threat
facing U.S. workers. His campaign has released more than 100
policy ideas, including eclectic proposals like creating an
infrastructure force called the Legion of Builders and
Destroyers. He lives in New York.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>AMY KLOBUCHAR</p>
              <p>The U.S. senator from Minnesota was the first moderate in
the Democratic field vying to challenge Trump. Klobuchar, 59,
gained national attention when she sparred with Brett Kavanaugh
during his Supreme Court nomination hearings last year. On the
campaign trail, the former prosecutor and corporate attorney has
said she would improve on the Affordable Care Act, popularly
known as Obamacare, by adding a public option, and is taking a
hard stance against rising prescription drug prices.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>BETO O'ROURKE</p>
              <p>The former U.S. congressman from Texas gained fame last year
for his record fundraising and ability to draw crowds ahead of
his unexpectedly narrow loss in the U.S. Senate race against
Republican incumbent Ted Cruz. But with progressive policies and
diversity at the forefront of the party's White House nominating
battle, O'Rourke, 47, has faced a challenge as a white man who
is more moderate on several key issues than many of his
competitors. He has increasingly turned his attention to gun
control and Trump's rhetoric about immigrants after a gunman
targeting Hispanics killed 22 people on Aug. 3 in El Paso,
O'Rourke's hometown.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>CORY BOOKER</p>
              <p>Booker, 50, a U.S. senator from New Jersey and former Newark
mayor, gained national prominence in the fight over Kavanaugh's
Supreme Court nomination. Booker, who is black, has made race
relations and racial disparities in the criminal justice system
a focus of his campaign. He embraces progressive positions on
healthcare coverage for every American, the Green New Deal and
other key issues, and touts his style of positivity over
attacks.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>MIRED AT BOTTOM OF POLLS</p>
              <p>Several candidates are stuck at the bottom according to
numerous polls, with few breakout moments so far.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>TULSI GABBARD</p>
              <p>The Samoan-American congresswoman from Hawaii and Iraq war
veteran is the first Hindu to serve in the U.S. House of
Representatives and has centered her campaign on her anti-war
stance. After working for her father's anti-gay advocacy group
and drafting relevant legislation, she was forced to apologize
for her past views on same-sex marriage. Gabbard's populist,
anti-war approach has won her fans among the far left and the
far right, and she recently engaged in a Twitter war with
Hillary Clinton, whom she called the ""personification of the
rot"" after Clinton suggested Gabbard was being groomed for a
third-party run at the presidency. Gabbard, 38, slammed Trump
for standing by Saudi Arabia after the murder of journalist
Jamal Khashoggi.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>JULIAN CASTRO</p>
              <p>Obama's secretary of housing and urban development would be
the first Hispanic to win a major U.S. party's presidential
nomination. Castro, 45, whose grandmother immigrated to Texas
from Mexico, has used his family's personal story to criticize
Trump's border policies. Castro advocates universal
prekindergarten, supports Medicare for All and cites his
experience to push for affordable housing. He announced his bid
in his hometown of San Antonio, where he once served as mayor
and a city councilman. In the third Democratic debate on Sept.
12, Castro drew jeers from the audience for an attack on Biden
that was perceived as questioning the former vice president's
memory as a way to draw attention to his age.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>TOM STEYER</p>
              <p>The billionaire environmentalist, a force in Democratic
fundraising over the past decade, said in January he was
focusing on his efforts to get Trump impeached and get Democrats
elected to the U.S. Congress. Steyer, 62, reversed course in
July, saying other Democrats had good ideas but ""we won't be
able to get any of those done until we end the hostile corporate
takeover of our democracy.""</p>
              <p/>
              <p>JOHN DELANEY</p>
              <p>The former U.S. representative from Maryland became the
first Democrat to enter the 2020 race, declaring his candidacy
in July 2017. Delaney, 56, says that if elected, he would focus
on advancing only bipartisan bills during the first 100 days of
his presidency. He is also pushing for a universal healthcare
system, raising the federal minimum wage and passing gun safety
legislation. A former business executive, Delaney is
self-funding much of his campaign.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>MICHAEL BENNET</p>
              <p>Bennet, 54, a U.S. senator for Colorado, has based his
political career on improving the American education system. He
previously ran Denver's public schools. Bennet is not well known
nationally but has built a network of political operatives and
donors helping elect other Democrats to the Senate. During the
partial U.S. government shutdown in January, he garnered
national attention criticizing Republicans for stopping the flow
of emergency funds to Colorado.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>STEVE BULLOCK</p>
              <p>Montana's Democratic governor, re-elected in 2016 in a
conservative state that Trump carried by 20 percentage points,
has touted his electability and ability to work across party
lines. Bullock, 53, has made campaign finance reform a
cornerstone of his agenda. He emphasizes his success in forging
compromises with the Republican-led state legislature on bills
to expand the Medicaid healthcare funding program for the poor,
increase campaign finance disclosures, bolster pay equity for
women and protect public lands.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>MARIANNE WILLIAMSON</p>
              <p>The 67-year-old best-selling author, motivational speaker
and Texas native believes her spirituality-focused campaign can
heal the United States. A 1992 interview on Oprah Winfrey's show
led Williamson to make a name for herself as a ""spiritual guide""
for Hollywood and a self-help expert. She is calling for $100
billion in reparations for slavery to be paid over 10 years, gun
control, education reform and equal rights for lesbian and gay
communities.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>WAYNE MESSAM</p>
              <p>Messam, 45, defeated a 16-year incumbent in 2015 to become
the first black mayor of the Miami suburb of Miramar. He was
re-elected in March. The son of Jamaican immigrants, he played
on Florida State University's 1993 national championship
football team and then started a construction business with his
wife. He has pledged to focus on reducing gun violence,
mitigating climate change and reducing student loan debt and the
cost of healthcare. Messam's Twitter profile says he is still
running for president, but federal records show he raised only
$5 during the third quarter of 2019.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>JOE SESTAK</p>
              <p>The retired three-star Navy admiral and former congressman
from Pennsylvania jumped into the race in June. Sestak, 67,
highlighted his 31-year military career and said he was running
to restore U.S. global leadership on challenges like climate
change and China's growing influence. Sestak said he had delayed
his entry in the race to be with his daughter as she
successfully fought a recurrence of brain cancer.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
              <p>Trump is the clear favorite to win the Republican

Oct 24 (Reuters) - The largest field of Democratic
presidential candidates in the modern U.S. political era got a
bit smaller on Thursday when U.S. Representative Tim Ryan
dropped out of the race, after failing to gain traction in
opinion polls.
Ryan, 46, a moderate from a blue-collar district in
northeastern Ohio, is the latest Democrat to end a bid for the
party's nomination to take on President Donald Trump, the likely
Republican nominee, in the November 2020 election.
Eighteen Democrats are still vying for the nomination, and
three Republicans are making a long-shot challenge to Trump's
renomination. The latest to enter the Republican race is former
U.S. Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina, who
announced his bid on Sept. 8.
The diverse group of Democrats includes six U.S. senators. A
record five women are running, as well as black, Hispanic, Asian
and openly gay candidates who would make history if one of them
becomes the party's nominee.
A top tier of contenders has emerged from the crowded field,
while others are still trying to break through. (Here is a
graphic https://tmsnrt.rs/2UhJ7WE of the Republican and
Democratic presidential fields.)
DEMOCRATIC TOP TIER
Here are the Democrats who are ranked in the top five in
Reuters/Ipsos polling:

JOE BIDEN
Biden, the early front-runner in opinion polls among
Democratic presidential contenders, waited until late April to
enter the race, launching his bid with a direct swipe at Trump.
Biden, 76, served eight years as President Barack Obama's vice
president and 36 years in the U.S. Senate. He stands at the
center of the Democratic debate over whether the party's
standard-bearer should be a veteran politician or a newcomer,
and whether a liberal or a moderate has a better chance of
defeating Trump. Biden, who frequently notes his ""Middle-Class
Joe"" nickname, touts his working-class roots and ability to work
in a bipartisan fashion. He has faced criticism from some fellow
Democrats for his role in passing tough-on-crime legislation in
the 1990s.

ELIZABETH WARREN
The 70-year-old U.S. senator from Massachusetts is a leader
of the party's liberals and a fierce critic of Wall Street who
was instrumental in creating the federal Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau (CFPB) after the 2008 financial crisis. Her
campaign has surged in recent weeks, tying or leading Biden in
some polls. She has focused her presidential campaign on a
populist economic message, promising to fight what she calls a
rigged system that favors the wealthy. She has released an array
of policy proposals on everything from breaking up big tech
companies to implementing a ""wealth tax"" on the richest
Americans. Warren has sworn off political fundraising events to
back her campaign.

BERNIE SANDERS
The U.S. senator from Vermont lost the Democratic nomination
in 2016 to Hillary Clinton but is trying again. For the 2020
race, Sanders, 78, is fighting to stand out in a field of
progressives running on issues he brought into the Democratic
Party mainstream four years ago.
Sanders suffered a heart attack while campaigning in Nevada
in October, but there has been little impact so far on his
support.
His proposals include free tuition at public colleges, a
$15-an-hour minimum wage and universal healthcare. He benefits
from strong name recognition and an unmatched network of
small-dollar donors.

PETE BUTTIGIEG
The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, emerged from
virtual anonymity to become one of the party's brightest stars,
building momentum with young voters. A Harvard University
graduate and Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford, he
speaks seven languages conversationally and served in
Afghanistan with the U.S. Navy Reserve. He touts himself as
representing a new generation of leadership needed to combat
Trump. Buttigieg would be the first openly gay presidential
nominee of a major American political party.

KAMALA HARRIS
The first-term U.S. senator from California would make
history as the first black woman to gain the nomination. Harris,
55, the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, announced
her candidacy on the holiday honoring slain civil rights leader
Martin Luther King Jr. She supports a middle-class tax credit,
the Green New Deal and marijuana legalization. Her track record
as San Francisco's district attorney and California's attorney
general has drawn scrutiny in a Democratic Party that has grown
more liberal in recent years on criminal justice issues. She saw
a significant bounce in the polls after a high-profile clash
with Biden over race issues during the first Democratic debate
in June but has since seen her numbers drop back down.

TRYING TO BREAK THROUGH
The field also includes many Democrats who are looking for a
way to break through. Some hold public office and managed to
generate an early fundraising base, while others are still
trying to raise their profiles.

ANDREW YANG
The entrepreneur and former tech executive is focusing his
campaign on an ambitious universal income plan. Yang, 44, wants
to guarantee all Americans between the ages of 18 and 64 a
$1,000 check every month. The son of immigrants from Taiwan,
Yang supports the Medicare for All proposal, which is based on
the existing government-run Medicare program for Americans 65
and older, and has warned that automation is the biggest threat
facing U.S. workers. His campaign has released more than 100
policy ideas, including eclectic proposals like creating an
infrastructure force called the Legion of Builders and
Destroyers. He lives in New York.

AMY KLOBUCHAR
The U.S. senator from Minnesota was the first moderate in
the Democratic field vying to challenge Trump. Klobuchar, 59,
gained national attention when she sparred with Brett Kavanaugh
during his Supreme Court nomination hearings last year. On the
campaign trail, the former prosecutor and corporate attorney has
said she would improve on the Affordable Care Act, popularly
known as Obamacare, by adding a public option, and is taking a
hard stance against rising prescription drug prices.

BETO O'ROURKE
The former U.S. congressman from Texas gained fame last year
for his record fundraising and ability to draw crowds ahead of
his unexpectedly narrow loss in the U.S. Senate race against
Republican incumbent Ted Cruz. But with progressive policies and
diversity at the forefront of the party's White House nominating
battle, O'Rourke, 47, has faced a challenge as a white man who
is more moderate on several key issues than many of his
competitors. He has increasingly turned his attention to gun
control and Trump's rhetoric about immigrants after a gunman
targeting Hispanics killed 22 people on Aug. 3 in El Paso,
O'Rourke's hometown.

CORY BOOKER
Booker, 50, a U.S. senator from New Jersey and former Newark
mayor, gained national prominence in the fight over Kavanaugh's
Supreme Court nomination. Booker, who is black, has made race
relations and racial disparities in the criminal justice system
a focus of his campaign. He embraces progressive positions on
healthcare coverage for every American, the Green New Deal and
other key issues, and touts his style of positivity over
attacks.

MIRED AT BOTTOM OF POLLS
Several candidates are stuck at the bottom according to
numerous polls, with few breakout moments so far.

TULSI GABBARD
The Samoan-American congresswoman from Hawaii and Iraq war
veteran is the first Hindu to serve in the U.S. House of
Representatives and has centered her campaign on her anti-war
stance. After working for her father's anti-gay advocacy group
and drafting relevant legislation, she was forced to apologize
for her past views on same-sex marriage. Gabbard's populist,
anti-war approach has won her fans among the far left and the
far right, and she recently engaged in a Twitter war with
Hillary Clinton, whom she called the ""personification of the
rot"" after Clinton suggested Gabbard was being groomed for a
third-party run at the presidency. Gabbard, 38, slammed Trump
for standing by Saudi Arabia after the murder of journalist
Jamal Khashoggi.

JULIAN CASTRO
Obama's secretary of housing and urban development would be
the first Hispanic to win a major U.S. party's presidential
nomination. Castro, 45, whose grandmother immigrated to Texas
from Mexico, has used his family's personal story to criticize
Trump's border policies. Castro advocates universal
prekindergarten, supports Medicare for All and cites his
experience to push for affordable housing. He announced his bid
in his hometown of San Antonio, where he once served as mayor
and a city councilman. In the third Democratic debate on Sept.
12, Castro drew jeers from the audience for an attack on Biden
that was perceived as questioning the former vice president's
memory as a way to draw attention to his age.

fundraising over the past decade, said in January he was
focusing on his efforts to get Trump impeached and get Democrats
elected to the U.S. Congress. Steyer, 62, reversed course in
July, saying other Democrats had good ideas but ""we won't be

on advancing only bipartisan bills during the first 100 days of
his presidency. He is also pushing for a universal healthcare
system, raising the federal minimum wage and passing gun safety
legislation. A former business executive, Delaney is
self-funding much of his campaign.

MICHAEL BENNET
Bennet, 54, a U.S. senator for Colorado, has based his
political career on improving the American education system. He
previously ran Denver's public schools. Bennet is not well known
nationally but has built a network of political operatives and
donors helping elect other Democrats to the Senate. During the
partial U.S. government shutdown in January, he garnered
national attention criticizing Republicans for stopping the flow
of emergency funds to Colorado.

STEVE BULLOCK
Montana's Democratic governor, re-elected in 2016 in a
conservative state that Trump carried by 20 percentage points,
has touted his electability and ability to work across party
lines. Bullock, 53, has made campaign finance reform a
cornerstone of his agenda. He emphasizes his success in forging
compromises with the Republican-led state legislature on bills
to expand the Medicaid healthcare funding program for the poor,
increase campaign finance disclosures, bolster pay equity for
women and protect public lands.

MARIANNE WILLIAMSON
The 67-year-old best-selling author, motivational speaker
and Texas native believes her spirituality-focused campaign can
heal the United States. A 1992 interview on Oprah Winfrey's show
led Williamson to make a name for herself as a ""spiritual guide""
for Hollywood and a self-help expert. She is calling for $100
billion in reparations for slavery to be paid over 10 years, gun
control, education reform and equal rights for lesbian and gay
communities.

              <p>BRUSSELS (Reuters) - When France shut the Calais shanty town known as the Jungle in 2016, migrants seeking entry to Britain were forced to look for less safe passage up the coast in Belgium - the route taken by a truck in which 39 bodies were found this week.</p>
              <p>Belgium's federal prosecutors, who handle cases of terrorism and organized crime, said on Thursday they had opened an investigation into the deadly transport. Initial findings showed the truck passed through the Belgian cargo port of Zeebrugge, from where it crossed by ferry to Britain.</p>
              <p>The victims - 31 men and eight women, all believed to be Chinese nationals - were found in a refrigerated truck on an industrial estate 20 miles (32 km) east of London. The driver was detained on suspicion of murder.</p>
              <p>Belgian prosecutors said they were looking into when and where the victims were loaded into the container. Regional British police said a case of human trafficking was suspected.</p>
              <p>This was not the first fatal migrant transport routed through Zeebrugge - a container with the bodies of 58 Chinese inside found in the English port of Dover in 2000 had also come from the Belgian port.</p>
              <p>However, in recent years the focus of migrant efforts to reach Britain was the French port of Calais - across the Channel from Dover - offering more than hourly ferry services and an undersea tunnel on the shortest crossing to the United Kingdom.</p>
              <p>The migrant community in Calais grew to some 6,000 people, most of them in a shanty town dubbed the Jungle, outside Calais until French authorities emptied it in October 2016, saying it was a security and health hazard.</p>
              <p>Cast adrift and driven away from Calais by the Jungle's closure, many migrants looking for the next closest passage points made their way north to neighboring Belgium, said Stef Janssens at that country's federal center of migration.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>MIGRANT ROUTE SHIFTS</p>
              <p>""There was a shift of the route to Britain from Calais to Belgium's E40 highway,"" he said, with people trafficking gangs taking control of parking spots where migrants congregate along the motorway leading from Brussels to the North Sea coast.</p>
              <p>In contrast with Calais, Zeebrugge largely handles cargo with far fewer leisure travelers. </p>
              <p>Dogs and heat scanners are used to detect stowaways though they might not be spotted in sealed, refrigerated containers like the one in which the 39 bodies were discovered this week.</p>
              <p>In 2014, an Afghan migrant was found dead in a container that had arrived in the British port of Tilbury, along with 34 who had survived. This also had gone through Zeebrugge, but at a time when the scanner was not working. </p>
              <p>""If they had to open up every container or every truck... there would be trucks (queued up) from here to Brussels. Every day there are 4,000 trucks coming to this port,"" Dirk de Fauw, mayor of the city of Bruges and chairman of adjacent Zeebrugge, told Reuters television.</p>
              <p>Smugglers remain on the E40 motorway, Janssens said, but in their hunt for spots with weaker port controls and security, they had headed even further north in the past two years.</p>

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - When France shut the Calais shanty town known as the Jungle in 2016, migrants seeking entry to Britain were forced to look for less safe passage up the coast in Belgium - the route taken by a truck in which 39 bodies were found this week.
Belgium's federal prosecutors, who handle cases of terrorism and organized crime, said on Thursday they had opened an investigation into the deadly transport. Initial findings showed the truck passed through the Belgian cargo port of Zeebrugge, from where it crossed by ferry to Britain.
The victims - 31 men and eight women, all believed to be Chinese nationals - were found in a refrigerated truck on an industrial estate 20 miles (32 km) east of London. The driver was detained on suspicion of murder.
Belgian prosecutors said they were looking into when and where the victims were loaded into the container. Regional British police said a case of human trafficking was suspected.
This was not the first fatal migrant transport routed through Zeebrugge - a container with the bodies of 58 Chinese inside found in the English port of Dover in 2000 had also come from the Belgian port.
However, in recent years the focus of migrant efforts to reach Britain was the French port of Calais - across the Channel from Dover - offering more than hourly ferry services and an undersea tunnel on the shortest crossing to the United Kingdom.
The migrant community in Calais grew to some 6,000 people, most of them in a shanty town dubbed the Jungle, outside Calais until French authorities emptied it in October 2016, saying it was a security and health hazard.
Cast adrift and driven away from Calais by the Jungle's closure, many migrants looking for the next closest passage points made their way north to neighboring Belgium, said Stef Janssens at that country's federal center of migration.

MIGRANT ROUTE SHIFTS
""There was a shift of the route to Britain from Calais to Belgium's E40 highway,"" he said, with people trafficking gangs taking control of parking spots where migrants congregate along the motorway leading from Brussels to the North Sea coast.
In contrast with Calais, Zeebrugge largely handles cargo with far fewer leisure travelers. 
Dogs and heat scanners are used to detect stowaways though they might not be spotted in sealed, refrigerated containers like the one in which the 39 bodies were discovered this week.
In 2014, an Afghan migrant was found dead in a container that had arrived in the British port of Tilbury, along with 34 who had survived. This also had gone through Zeebrugge, but at a time when the scanner was not working. 
""If they had to open up every container or every truck... there would be trucks (queued up) from here to Brussels. Every day there are 4,000 trucks coming to this port,"" Dirk de Fauw, mayor of the city of Bruges and chairman of adjacent Zeebrugge, told Reuters television.
Smugglers remain on the E40 motorway, Janssens said, but in their hunt for spots with weaker port controls and security, they had headed even further north in the past two years.
""This has also shifted to Antwerp and ports such as Hook of Holland in the Netherlands because these ports are used less and subject to lesser controls,"" Janssens said.
Smuggling migrants is lucrative, he said, with migrants charged up to 6,000 euros ($6,690) for ""guaranteed"" passage to Britain.
The Geneva-based International Organization for Migration (IOM) says it has noted a trend in the past year of increasing numbers of migrants also trying to cross to Britain in small boats. There were five drownings in the Channel this year.
The 39 deaths this week brought the total number of fatalities among migrants crossing the European continent to 97, compared with 92 at the same juncture in 2018.

By Marine  Strauss and Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS, Oct 24 (Reuters) - When France shut the Calais
shanty town known as the Jungle in 2016, migrants seeking entry
to Britain were forced to look for less safe passage up the
coast in Belgium - the route taken by a truck in which 39 bodies
were found this week.
Belgium's federal prosecutors, who handle cases of terrorism
and organised crime, said on Thursday they had opened an
investigation into the deadly transport. Initial findings showed
the truck passed through the Belgian cargo port of Zeebrugge,
from where it crossed by ferry to Britain.
The victims - 31 men and eight women, all believed to be
Chinese nationals - were found in a refrigerated truck on an
industrial estate 20 miles (32 km) east of London. The driver
was detained on suspicion of murder.
Belgian prosecutors said they were looking into when and
where the victims were loaded into the container. Regional
British police said a case of human trafficking was suspected.
This was not the first fatal migrant transport routed
through Zeebrugge - a container with the bodies of 58 Chinese
inside found in the English port of Dover in 2000 had also come
from the Belgian port.
However, in recent years the focus of migrant efforts to
reach Britain was the French port of Calais - across the Channel
from Dover - offering more than hourly ferry services and an
undersea tunnel on the shortest crossing to the United Kingdom.
The migrant community in Calais grew to some 6,000 people,
most of them in a shanty town dubbed the Jungle, outside Calais
until French authorities emptied it in October 2016, saying it
was a security and health hazard.
Cast adrift and driven away from Calais by the Jungle's
closure, many migrants looking for the next closest passage
points made their way north to neighbouring Belgium, said Stef
Janssens at that country's federal centre of migration.

MIGRANT ROUTE SHIFTS
""There was a shift of the route to Britain from Calais to
Belgium's E40 highway,"" he said, with people trafficking gangs
taking control of parking spots where migrants congregate along
the motorway leading from Brussels to the North Sea coast.
In contrast with Calais, Zeebrugge largely handles cargo
with far fewer leisure travellers.
Dogs and heat scanners are used to detect stowaways though
they might not be spotted in sealed, refrigerated containers
like the one in which the 39 bodies were discovered this week.
In 2014, an Afghan migrant was found dead in a container
that had arrived in the British port of Tilbury, along with 34
who had survived. This also had gone through Zeebrugge, but at a
time when the scanner was not working.
""If they had to open up every container or every truck...
there would be trucks (queued up) from here to Brussels. Every
day there are 4,000 trucks coming to this port,"" Dirk de Fauw,
mayor of the city of Bruges and chairman of adjacent Zeebrugge,
told Reuters television.
Smugglers remain on the E40 motorway, Janssens said, but in
their hunt for spots with weaker port controls and security,
they had headed even further north in the past two years.
""This has also shifted to Antwerp and ports such as Hook of
Holland in the Netherlands because these ports are used less and
subject to lesser controls,"" Janssens said.
Smuggling migrants is lucrative, he said, with migrants
charged up to 6,000 euros ($6,690) for ""guaranteed"" passage to
Britain.
The Geneva-based International Organization for Migration
(IOM) says it has noted a trend in the past year of increasing
numbers of migrants also trying to cross to Britain in small
boats. There were five drownings in the Channel this year.
The 39 deaths this week brought the total number of
fatalities among migrants crossing the European continent to 97,
compared with 92 at the same juncture in 2018.

PRAGUE, Oct 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Rising
populism and nationalism pose the greatest threats to LGBT+
rights in Europe, activists said on Thursday as they gathered in
Prague for a major annual conference.
Campaigners attending the annual conference of LGBT+ rights
organisation ILGA-Europe said they had growing concerns about
the rise of right-wing politicians and a dip in public support.
As the three-day conference got under way, the Thomson
Reuters Foundation asked delegates what they saw as the greatest
threats to LGBT+ rights in Europe.

ADELA HORAKOVA, ADVOCACY DIRECTOR, JSME FER (THE CZECH
MARRIAGE EQUALITY CAMPAIGN)
""The deconstruction of democracy... impacts us (and) it
impacts others.
""The impact on other people is not so visible yet as we are
being used in the forefront as a tool of the fight against
democracy, but that is the biggest threat – the framework is
falling apart.
""We might see numbers of public support falling as people
are not immune to the fear-mongering they hear around them.
Certainly, there is a risk of regression.""
CZESLAW WALEK, FOUNDER, PRAGUE PRIDE
""We just conducted a survey with the (Czech) ombudsperson
and the main finding that came out of it was that only 11% of
people think LGBTI people are discriminated against in our
country, but in fact 75% of Czech LGBTI people experience
discrimination throughout their life.
""There is this discrepancy between perception and reality
and LGBTI people do not report this discrimination because they
don't trust the local authorities to solve it.""

MARJOLEIN VAN DEN BRINK, LECTURER IN LAW, UTRECHT UNIVERSITY
""What is a problem is that some of our right-wing populist
parties (in the Netherlands) take this idea of liberal Western
Europe and then they polarise it.
""They set us as liberal Western Europeans apart from
basically anyone who wants to enter the country.
""(But) I am inclined to be optimistic. It's not even 20

couples which prior to 2000 no one had expected.
""This whole issue of third gender or questioning gender (we
wouldn't have seen) not even 15 years ago.
""It's going very fast and maybe that's also what triggers
the backlash and there's a risk in that.""
EVELYNE PARADIS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ILGA-EUROPE
""The two biggest threats to LGBTI rights in Europe are the
overall rise in populism and attacks on democracy everywhere
because it is fostering hatred and fuelling hatred and violence
that affects the LGBTI communities in particular.
""It's just fuelling division for everyone in society, so in

              <p>WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Spare
rooms are no longer just for guests and Airbnb.</p>
              <p>The lucrative room-letting business has inspired a new way
of housing ex-inmates as the United States tests a raft of
innovations to ease prisoner release, when a place to call home
is a top priority yet often the hardest thing to find.</p>
              <p>Ex-prisoners say the freedom and security they get from a
room of their own is a huge turnaround after a decade-plus of
bunking up in crowded jails, and an opportunity to start afresh.</p>
              <p>“I had my own room, for the first time in over 10 years,”
said KC Matthews, among the first to benefit from the
Airbnb-style, post-prison programme.</p>
              <p>“It provided me a safe space, my own space, and provided me
stability … to do the other things I needed to do,” he told the
Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.</p>
              <p>Since August 2018, the Homecoming Project has been matching
people due to leave prison with local hosts with spare space in
Alameda County, outside San Francisco.</p>
              <p>Researchers, advocates and policymakers increasingly say
that safe and stable housing is critical to helping prisoners
adapt to life in the outside world — and to staying there.</p>
              <p>Traditionally, prisoners fended for themselves on release —
a challenge that pushes many back into jail — or enrolled in
transitional housing programmes with heavy restrictions.</p>
              <p>Now different cities are trying new ways to help inmates
slot back into life, and housing is one of their key tools.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>HOME SWEET HOME</p>
              <p>For Matthews, a transgender man who had lived on the streets
and in foster care for much of his life, his anxiety grew ever
more acute as his release date neared.</p>
              <p>“Is there a place that will accept me and where I will be
comfortable?” said Matthews, 51. ""This was weighing me down at a
time I should have been happy — I was getting out of prison!”</p>
              <p>Which is where Homecoming came in.</p>
              <p>It paired Matthews with a potential host, then gave them
opportunities to talk by phone before his release.</p>
              <p>It worked.</p>
              <p>When he got out, Matthews said he was able to apply
immediately for a driving licence, social security card and
other necessities: critical errands that he said would have
taken him a month under traditional transitional housing rules.</p>
              <p>He was also able to ease back into the rhythms of life out
of prison — re-learning how to shop for food and more — while
his temporary home offered a safe haven as he adjusted.</p>
              <p>“That was one less thing on my plate — housing and safety,”
he said.</p>
              <p>The Homecoming Project works only with people jailed for at
least a decade, said Terah Lawyer, project coordinator at Impact
Justice, a nonprofit that runs the initiative.</p>
              <p>""If you’re gone for 10 years, you come back completely a
ghost,” she said, referring to inmates whose driving licence,
credit history and identity papers get erased.</p>
              <p>“It was inspired by the Airbnb model and realising that …
anyone who has the money can stay at an Airbnb without anyone
checking their record, but getting their own housing is
complicated,” she said.</p>
              <p>By placing ex-prisoners with community hosts and mentors for
six months, the pilot project bypasses the tight restrictions of
state transitional housing and helps inmates re-integrate.</p>
              <p>“The community hosts are going to be role-modelling what
life is like in the community for participants,” Lawyer said.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>CELL TO SHELTER</p>
              <p>For prisoners to get any home on release is complicated.</p>
              <p>In large urban areas, half of those released each year face
homelessness, according to a 2016 report. Almost 50,000 people
go directly to shelters on release, according to federal data.</p>
              <p>""The period after release from prison is about the most
extreme poverty you can imagine,” said Wanda Bertram with the
Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit.</p>
              <p>Money aside, she said, inmates need new ID, as well as find
a landlord who will accept tenants with a criminal record and a
place that meets their own often onerous parole requirements.</p>
              <p>Those who have spent a single stint in prison are seven
times more likely to experience homelessness than the rest of
the U.S. population, and those who have been jailed multiple
times are 13 times more likely to be homeless, according to a
first-ever national estimate that PPI put out last year.</p>
              <p>There is no national data, Bertram said, but recognition of
the issue has broken into the 2020 presidential campaign.</p>
              <p>Former vice president Joe Biden, now a top-polling candidate
for president, has said that if elected he will “set a national
goal of ensuring 100% of formerly incarcerated individuals have
housing upon re-entry” from prison.</p>
              <p>There is also a fledgling legal push underway to scrap
rule-bound screening processes that can deny would-be tenants
any shot at renting a home if they carry a criminal record, even
prohibiting stays with family members.</p>
              <p>Since the federal government highlighted the issue in 2016,
10 municipalities have enacted what are known as “Fair Chance”
policies, said Deborah Thrope, supervising attorney with the
National Housing Law Project, a legal advocacy group.</p>
              <p>“This is the first time people are really taking a hard look
at screening policies, especially around affordable housing,”
said Thrope.</p>
              <p>Another 2020 presidential candidate, Senator Kamala Harris
of California, has floated a proposal that would make local Fair
Chance strategies apply to federal housing policies.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>$25 AND A BUS TICKET</p>
              <p>It would mark a major change from the old ways, experts say.</p>
              <p>“What generally happened when we released in Georgia
historically is you’d get $25 and a bus ticket to wherever you
came from,” said Tom McElhenney, director of transitional
services for the Georgia Department of Corrections.</p>
              <p>Those released in such a way “go into survival mode and go
back to what they can do to survive, which is usually dealing
drugs and other illegal” activity, McElhenney told the Thomson
Reuters Foundation by phone. “We want to break that cycle.”</p>
              <p>Last year, the state prison system started a project in
Atlanta to do just that — the Metro Reentry Facility.</p>
              <p>The standalone facility puts prisoners nearing release
through an intensive programme of life skills and vocational
classes, certification courses and more, seeking to ensure that
when they leave, they have a job and a home, McElhenney said.</p>
              <p>That means working closely with housing providers and
updating inmates’ ID — a common barrier to getting on.</p>
              <p>It also offers a space where family members can get to know
each other again. “A lot of those released go and live with
family members,” said McElhenney. “Your best chance for success
is with someone who knows you and can support you.”</p>
              <p>So far about 80 people have gone through the Metro Reentry
Facility, and the state wants to set up similar operations
outside of Atlanta, he said. “We hope this will reduce
recidivism and are confident it probably will.”

Researchers, advocates and policymakers increasingly say
that safe and stable housing is critical to helping prisoners

Traditionally, prisoners fended for themselves on release —
a challenge that pushes many back into jail — or enrolled in
transitional housing programmes with heavy restrictions.
Now different cities are trying new ways to help inmates
slot back into life, and housing is one of their key tools.

HOME SWEET HOME
For Matthews, a transgender man who had lived on the streets
and in foster care for much of his life, his anxiety grew ever
more acute as his release date neared.
“Is there a place that will accept me and where I will be
comfortable?” said Matthews, 51. ""This was weighing me down at a
time I should have been happy — I was getting out of prison!”
Which is where Homecoming came in.
It paired Matthews with a potential host, then gave them
opportunities to talk by phone before his release.
It worked.
When he got out, Matthews said he was able to apply
immediately for a driving licence, social security card and
other necessities: critical errands that he said would have
taken him a month under traditional transitional housing rules.
He was also able to ease back into the rhythms of life out
of prison — re-learning how to shop for food and more — while
his temporary home offered a safe haven as he adjusted.
“That was one less thing on my plate — housing and safety,”
he said.
The Homecoming Project works only with people jailed for at
least a decade, said Terah Lawyer, project coordinator at Impact

""If you’re gone for 10 years, you come back completely a

six months, the pilot project bypasses the tight restrictions of
state transitional housing and helps inmates re-integrate.
“The community hosts are going to be role-modelling what
life is like in the community for participants,” Lawyer said.

CELL TO SHELTER
For prisoners to get any home on release is complicated.
In large urban areas, half of those released each year face
homelessness, according to a 2016 report. Almost 50,000 people
go directly to shelters on release, according to federal data.

There is no national data, Bertram said, but recognition of

at screening policies, especially around affordable housing,”
said Thrope.
Another 2020 presidential candidate, Senator Kamala Harris
of California, has floated a proposal that would make local Fair
Chance strategies apply to federal housing policies.

$25 AND A BUS TICKET
It would mark a major change from the old ways, experts say.
“What generally happened when we released in Georgia
historically is you’d get $25 and a bus ticket to wherever you
came from,” said Tom McElhenney, director of transitional
services for the Georgia Department of Corrections.
Those released in such a way “go into survival mode and go
back to what they can do to survive, which is usually dealing
drugs and other illegal” activity, McElhenney told the Thomson
Reuters Foundation by phone. “We want to break that cycle.”
Last year, the state prison system started a project in
Atlanta to do just that — the Metro Reentry Facility.
The standalone facility puts prisoners nearing release
through an intensive programme of life skills and vocational
classes, certification courses and more, seeking to ensure that
when they leave, they have a job and a home, McElhenney said.
That means working closely with housing providers and
updating inmates’ ID — a common barrier to getting on.
It also offers a space where family members can get to know
each other again. “A lot of those released go and live with
family members,” said McElhenney. “Your best chance for success
is with someone who knows you and can support you.”
So far about 80 people have gone through the Metro Reentry
Facility, and the state wants to set up similar operations
outside of Atlanta, he said. “We hope this will reduce
recidivism and are confident it probably will.”

              <p>TOKYO, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
and South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon agreed on Thursday
on the importance of cooperating on North Korea and other
issues, seeking to rebuild relations amid a bitter feud over
history and trade.</p>

              <p>Relations between Tokyo and Seoul have deteriorated to their
lowest in decades since South Korea's top court last October
ordered some Japanese firms to compensate Koreans forced to work

              <p>Japan, which says the matter was settled by a 1965 treaty,
calls the decision a violation of international law, and the
feud has spilled over into trade and security matters.</p>
              <p>About 100 journalists were present at the start of talks in
Tokyo, the highest-level meeting between the two sides since the
row flared. The meeting began with a handshake but no smiles.</p>
              <p>Abe urged Seoul to keep its promises - a reference to the
1965 treaty - in order to restore relations, according to
statement issued by Japan's foreign ministry.</p>
              <p>""Our two nations are important neighbours for each other,

our ties with the United States are quite important,"" Abe was
quoted as telling Lee.</p>

not be left that way. If South Korea can keep bilateral
promises, that could be a chance to return to a healthy

              <p>The statement also quoted Lee as saying he shared the view
that dialogue was important, while a parallel statement from
South Korea's foreign ministry said Lee agreed relations should
not be left in their current difficult state.</p>
              <p>Abe also repeated Tokyo's stance that the South Korean court
ruling overturned the basis of two-way ties.</p>
              <p>“Abe said the South Korean top court ruling is in clear

has also respected and complied with the 1965 Treaty on Basic
Relations and Claims, and will continue to do so,"" according to
Seoul's statement.</p>
              <p>Lee, who was in Tokyo to attend Japanese Emperor Naruhito's

TOKYO, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
and South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon agreed on Thursday
on the importance of cooperating on North Korea and other
issues, seeking to rebuild relations amid a bitter feud over
history and trade.
But there was scant sign of real progress and Abe reiterated
that South Korea would need to keep its promises for ties
between the two Asian allies of Washington to improve.
Relations between Tokyo and Seoul have deteriorated to their

DIFFICULT HISTORY
The animosity between Japan and South Korea is linked to the
history of Japan's 1910-45 colonisation of the Korean peninsula,
the mobilisation of forced labour at companies and women in
wartime military brothels, and a row over the ownership of
islets in the sea between the two nations.
Earlier this year, the dispute escalated when Japan

eligible for fast-track exports, steps angrily denounced by

In August, South Korea announced it would scrap a military
intelligence-sharing pact with Japan when it expires next month,
just as the allies face rising tensions over North Korea's
nuclear weapons programme and increased competition from China
and Russia.
Further potential flashpoints loom.
Thousands of South Korean students and activists are
expected to gather on Friday to celebrate ""Dokdo Day"". Dokdo is
the Korean name for islets claimed by South Korea and by Japan,
which calls them Takeshima.
South Korea is also planning to order asset sales of the
Japanese companies found liable for damages under last year's

MADRID (Reuters) - For one activist jailed by Spain's Fascists for his political views, Thursday's exhumation and reburial of Francisco Franco's bones after decades lying in state marks a bittersweet moment.
Now 93, Nicolas Sanchez-Albornoz was forced as a prisoner of the Franco regime to help build the Valley of the Fallen, the mausoleum that has been the dictator's resting place since his death in 1975.
""It was time (to move him). It was overdue,"" retired historian Sanchez-Albornoz told Reuters. 
""We've waited many decades for (Franco) to disappear from this monument, which ... was the shame of Spain. All the dictators of Franco's ilk have vanished from Europe - Hitler, Mussolini - and were not honored with such tombs.""
In a carefully choreographed ceremony, Franco's remains will be removed from the Valley of the Fallen and reburied in a family plot under a plan ratified by a divided parliament and approved last month by Spain's Supreme Court.
In 1947, with the civil war that convulsed the country from 1936 to 1939 still fresh in collective memory, a military court sentenced Sanchez-Albornoz to forced labor for membership of an anti-Fascist student association. 
Four months later he escaped to France with the help of compatriots exiled there who, he recalled, provided him with false papers, cash and a car they borrowed from U.S. novelist and liberal activist Norman Mailer, who was touring Europe at the time.
""Spain at the cusp of 1948 was still one huge jail,"" he said. ""Driving down the road, there were military police barricades every 20 kilometers (12 miles) who would stop you and ask for your papers.""

""I SEE THIS AS A BEGINNING""
Sanchez-Albornoz was one of the lucky ones.
Many of his fellow prisoners died and were buried in the valley, along with other opposition activists - and he hopes the removal of Franco's remains might open the door to using modern forensic techniques to identify some other bodies it contains.
""Some might think that Franco's exhumation is the end of a phase. I see this as the beginning of one,"" he said in his Madrid apartment. 
""Many more exhumations await, of those who were executed by the regime or moved there against or without families' permission. Families have requested their bodies be returned, so they can be buried with their kin, in their home towns.""
Without such an effort, he believes Spain will struggle to come to terms with Franco's still divisive legacy.
And while he tolerates those who oppose the exhumation, his hostility towards Franco remains acute. 
""He should not have been buried in the first place. He should have suffered the same fate as his victims,"" he said.
Sanchez-Albornoz views the millions of euros successive government have spent maintaining the mausoleum as an ""inexplicable contradiction"" between democracy in theory and practice.
He refers to the valley only by its pre-Franco name of Cuelgamuros and describes his relationship with it as special -  ""a place of imprisonment, but also of liberation.""
Spain's governing Socialists have long sought to turn it into a memorial to the around 500,000 civil war dead.
But should the mass graves ever be exhumed and victims' remains returned to their ancestors, Sanchez-Albornoz favors a simpler fate. ""Let nature take charge of that place's destiny,"" he said.

              <p>In 1947, with the civil war that convulsed the country from

MADRID, Oct 24 (Reuters) - For one activist jailed by
Spain's Fascists for his political views, Thursday's exhumation

              <p>By Clara-Laeila Laudette and John Stonestreet</p>
              <p>MADRID, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Spanish authorities will remove
Francisco Franco's remains from a state mausoleum on Thursday,
seeking to exorcise the ghost of a dictator whose legacy still
divides the country more than four decades after his death.</p>
              <p>Amid tight security and in virtual secrecy, his coffin will
be taken from the Valley of the Fallen and reburied in a private
family vault, transported either by helicopter or, if bad
weather intervenes, by guarded motorcade.</p>
              <p>""It's intensely symbolic for Spain,"" said political
scientist Pablo Simon, ""because the (Franco) monument has always
been connected to those who miss the old regime.""</p>
              <p>With media prohibited, the exhumation ceremony will be
witnessed by a select few: Justice Minister Dolores Delgado, a
forensics expert, a priest, and 22 of Franco's descendants.</p>
              <p>They include his oldest grandson Francisco Franco, who
labelled the operation - and its low-key nature - a political
ploy by the governing Socialist Party.</p>
              <p>""I feel a great deal of rage because they have used
something as cowardly as digging up a corpse, using a body as
propaganda and political publicity to win a handful of votes
before an election,"" he told Reuters late on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>In government since mid-2018 and facing a national election
next month, the Socialists have long sought to exhume Franco,
who unleashed the civil war that killed around 500,000 people
between 1936 and 1939.</p>
              <p>They won backing for the decision to move his remains from a
divided parliament, and the Supreme Court ratified it last month
after dismissing a challenge from Franco's descendents.</p>
              <p>The government estimates the move will cost up to 63,000
euros ($70,000).</p>
              <p>""Exhuming the dictator's body suggests that the Valley of
the Fallen's significance could be reclaimed, a normal process
within democracies like ours,"" Simon said.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>BURIED BESIDE HIS VICTIMS</p>
              <p>Although Franco died in 1975, divisions within Spain over
his removal from the Valley of the Fallen remain acute.</p>
              <p>An El Mundo poll this month showed 43% of Spaniards favoured
the operation, while 32.5% opposed it. On Monday, government
sources said some of the companies involved in the exhumation
had received threats.</p>
              <p>Franco's admirers saw him as a firm hand who fostered
Spain's longest period of peace after centuries of turmoil.</p>
              <p>Opponents, meanwhile, have long questioned the propriety of
a dictator being buried alongside his victims. Thousands of dead
Republicans were moved into the valley without their families'
consent, while the complex itself was partially built using the
forced labour of political prisoners.</p>
              <p>The latter include 93-year-old retired historian Nicolas
Sanchez-Albornoz.</p>
              <p>""It was time (to move him). It was overdue,"" he told Reuters
in an interview on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>""We've waited many decades for (Franco) to disappear from
this monument, which ... was the shame of Spain. All the
dictators of Franco's ilk have vanished from Europe - Hitler,
Mussolini - and were not honoured with such tombs.""</p>
              <p>Far-right party Vox has capitalised on the frustrations of
those supporting Franco's legacy, performing better than many
expected in national elections in April, and considers policies
barring discussion of it from public life as revisionist.</p>
              <p>But, as the next election looms on Nov. 10, Simon said he
believed the left could exploit divisions over the exhumation
within the moderate right-wing parties, which abstained from the
parliamentary vote on the issue.</p>
              <p>""The (conservative) Partido Popular prefers not to discuss
(the exhumation) because it could hurt their electoral
interests,"" he said.</p>
              <p>""It could spark a sort of cultural war between the PP and
Vox, one of the most disputed and porous frontiers in this
election.""</p>

MADRID, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Spanish authorities will remove
Francisco Franco's remains from a state mausoleum on Thursday,
seeking to exorcise the ghost of a dictator whose legacy still
divides the country more than four decades after his death.
Amid tight security and in virtual secrecy, his coffin will
be taken from the Valley of the Fallen and reburied in a private
family vault, transported either by helicopter or, if bad
weather intervenes, by guarded motorcade.
""It's intensely symbolic for Spain,"" said political
scientist Pablo Simon, ""because the (Franco) monument has always
been connected to those who miss the old regime.""
With media prohibited, the exhumation ceremony will be
witnessed by a select few: Justice Minister Dolores Delgado, a
forensics expert, a priest, and 22 of Franco's descendants.
They include his oldest grandson Francisco Franco, who
labelled the operation - and its low-key nature - a political
ploy by the governing Socialist Party.
""I feel a great deal of rage because they have used
something as cowardly as digging up a corpse, using a body as
propaganda and political publicity to win a handful of votes
before an election,"" he told Reuters late on Wednesday.
In government since mid-2018 and facing a national election
next month, the Socialists have long sought to exhume Franco,
who unleashed the civil war that killed around 500,000 people
between 1936 and 1939.
They won backing for the decision to move his remains from a
divided parliament, and the Supreme Court ratified it last month
after dismissing a challenge from Franco's descendents.
The government estimates the move will cost up to 63,000
euros ($70,000).
""Exhuming the dictator's body suggests that the Valley of
the Fallen's significance could be reclaimed, a normal process
within democracies like ours,"" Simon said.

BURIED BESIDE HIS VICTIMS
Although Franco died in 1975, divisions within Spain over
his removal from the Valley of the Fallen remain acute.
An El Mundo poll this month showed 43% of Spaniards favoured
the operation, while 32.5% opposed it. On Monday, government
sources said some of the companies involved in the exhumation
had received threats.
Franco's admirers saw him as a firm hand who fostered
Spain's longest period of peace after centuries of turmoil.
Opponents, meanwhile, have long questioned the propriety of
a dictator being buried alongside his victims. Thousands of dead
Republicans were moved into the valley without their families'
consent, while the complex itself was partially built using the
forced labour of political prisoners.
The latter include 93-year-old retired historian Nicolas
Sanchez-Albornoz.
""It was time (to move him). It was overdue,"" he told Reuters
in an interview on Wednesday.
""We've waited many decades for (Franco) to disappear from
this monument, which ... was the shame of Spain. All the
dictators of Franco's ilk have vanished from Europe - Hitler,
Mussolini - and were not honoured with such tombs.""
Far-right party Vox has capitalised on the frustrations of
those supporting Franco's legacy, performing better than many
expected in national elections in April, and considers policies
barring discussion of it from public life as revisionist.
But, as the next election looms on Nov. 10, Simon said he
believed the left could exploit divisions over the exhumation
within the moderate right-wing parties, which abstained from the
parliamentary vote on the issue.
""The (conservative) Partido Popular prefers not to discuss
(the exhumation) because it could hurt their electoral
interests,"" he said.
""It could spark a sort of cultural war between the PP and
Vox, one of the most disputed and porous frontiers in this
election.""

              <p>Climate finance analysts said the outcome would be key to

              <p>Environment and development groups are calling for at least

              <p>Lucile Dufour, international policy advisor with Climate

first conference in 2014.</p>
              <p>Since late last year the fund has secured pledges of about
$7.4 billion from 16 countries for 2020-2023, with large donors
like Germany, France and Britain doubling 2014 contributions.</p>
              <p>New announcements from some other potentially large donors

              <p>""It is not easy right now for any kind of financial
contributors to dramatically increase their contribution because
most of them are facing real budgetary constraints,"" Glemarec
said, noting some ""exceptional efforts"" to double donations.</p>
              <p>Despite total promises of just over $10 billion for the
fund's first five years, U.S. President Donald Trump, a
climate-change sceptic, refused to deliver two-thirds of his
country's  $3 billion pledge.</p>
              <p>Currency fluctuations meanwhile further cut the actual total

              <p>The GCF has allocated some $5.2 billion to 111 projects in

By Clara-Laeila Laudette and John Stonestreet
MADRID, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Spanish authorities will remove
Francisco Franco's remains from a state mausoleum on Thursday,
seeking to exorcise the ghost of a dictator whose legacy still
divides the country more than four decades after his death.
Amid tight security and in virtual secrecy, his coffin will
be taken from the Valley of the Fallen and reburied in a private
family vault, transported either by helicopter or, if bad
weather intervenes, by guarded motorcade.
""It's intensely symbolic for Spain,"" said political
scientist Pablo Simon, ""because the (Franco) monument has always
been connected to those who miss the old regime.""
With media prohibited, the exhumation ceremony will be
witnessed by a select few: Justice Minister Dolores Delgado, a
forensics expert, a priest, and 22 of Franco's descendants.
They include his oldest grandson Francisco Franco, who
labelled the operation - and its low-key nature - a political
ploy by the governing Socialist Party.
""I feel a great deal of rage because they have used
something as cowardly as digging up a corpse, using a body as
propaganda and political publicity to win a handful of votes
before an election,"" he told Reuters late on Wednesday.
In government since mid-2018 and facing a national election
next month, the Socialists have long sought to exhume Franco,
who unleashed the civil war that killed around 500,000 people
between 1936 and 1939.
They won backing for the decision to move his remains from a
divided parliament, and the Supreme Court ratified it last year
after dismissing a challenge from Franco's descendents.
The government estimates the move will cost up to 63,000
euros ($70,000).
""Exhuming the dictator's body suggests that the Valley of
the Fallen's significance could be reclaimed, a normal process
within democracies like ours,"" Simon said.

BURIED BESIDE HIS VICTIMS
Although Franco died in 1975, divisions within Spain over
his removal from the Valley of the Fallen remain acute.
An El Mundo poll this month showed 43% of Spaniards favoured
the operation, while 32.5% opposed it. On Monday, government
sources said some of the companies involved in the exhumation
had received threats.
Franco's admirers saw him as a firm hand who fostered
Spain's longest period of peace after centuries of turmoil.
Opponents, meanwhile, have long questioned the propriety of
a dictator being buried alongside his victims. Thousands of dead
Republicans were moved into the valley without their families'
consent, while the complex itself was partially built using the
forced labour of political prisoners.
The latter include 93-year-old retired historian Nicolas
Sanchez-Albornoz.
""It was time (to move him). It was overdue,"" he told Reuters
in an interview on Wednesday.
""We've waited many decades for (Franco) to disappear from
this monument, which ... was the shame of Spain. All the
dictators of Franco's ilk have vanished from Europe - Hitler,
Mussolini - and were not honoured with such tombs.""
Far-right party Vox has capitalised on the frustrations of
those supporting Franco's legacy, performing better than many

But, as the next election looms on Nov. 10, Simon said he

parliamentary vote on the issue.
""The (conservative) Partido Popular prefers not to discuss

interests,"" he said.
""It could spark a sort of cultural war between the PP and
Vox, one of the most disputed and porous frontiers in this
election.""

President and head of operations in the Americas.
Limited natural resources on the planet and the growing
public health problem of obesity are behind the changes Freixe
sees as necessary. He also cited growing public awareness of the
food production process as well as issues such as child labor
and deforestation, which is especially pertinent in Brazil.
Meat production, particularly beef, is a significant
contributor to carbon emissions that scientists blame for global
warming.
""We work constantly in the reformulation of our products,""
the executive told reporters ahead of an event in Sao Paulo with
university students from the four countries in the Mercosur
trade bloc:  Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. It is part
of a career training program sponsored by the company.
Freixe also said public awareness is growing around the
world regarding raw materials used to produce food. This poses a
challenge for every large food processor.
""There is a lot more sensitivy on the matter everywhere, not
only in Europe or the U.S. We are in a connected world, people
have access to information, consumers want to know where raw
materials come from, if they were produced ethically,"" he said.
Nestlé is a major buyer worldwide of coffee, sugar, cocoa
and milk, among other commodities. It is a significant buyer of
Brazilian coffee and sugar.
The company says it clearly states to suppliers that it does
not buy raw materials that were produced in recently deforested
areas or where child labor has been reported.
""The question mark is how to make that happen? Because there
are millions of farmers in so many countries,"" the executive
said. ""When there is an indication of a problem, we investigate.
If confirmed, we cut the supplier,"" he added.
Forest fires and deforestation in the Amazon, the world's
largest rainforest, jumped sharply this year, causing a wave of
worldwide criticism regarding how the local government is
managing the situation.
Global food companies were also pressed by consumers and
activists to avoid sourcing commodities from places where
forests were recently cleared.

'TOP SECRET'
Martins was ""provisionally detained for extradition"" and is
being held in prison in Mexico City, the office of Mexico's
attorney general said in a statement, without giving further
details.
It is unclear when or whether Martins, who took Mexican
nationality after settling in the country in the mid-2000s, will

It takes typically more than a year for extradition requests
to be decided, according to legal experts.
""The federal executive has the discretion to decide whether

sentences handed down have been from 14 to 15 years, Mangano
said.
The charges against Martins, 71, involve a criminal
complaint filed by his own daughter, Lorena Martins, who came
forward in 2011 to detail how the brothels operated, as well as
people who worked in the brothels and victims, Mangano said.

bodies of 39 people inside a truck at an industrial estate near
London on Wednesday and said they had arrested the driver on
suspicion of murder.</p>
              <p>The discovery of the bodies - 38 adults and one teenager -
was made in the early hours after emergency services were
alerted to people in a truck container on an industrial site in
Grays, about 20 miles (32 km) east of central London.</p>
              <p>Police said the trailer had arrived at nearby docks having
travelled from Zeebrugge in Belgium and the bodies were found
just over an hour later.</p>
              <p>The red cab unit of the truck was believed to have
originated in Ireland. It had ""Ireland"" emblazoned on the
windscreen along with the message ""The Ultimate Dream"". The
driver, a 25-year-old man from Northern Ireland, remained in
custody.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was appalled by the
news and was receiving regular updates about the investigation
which was focused on human trafficking.</p>
              <p>""We know that this trade is going on - all such traders in
human beings should be hunted down and brought to justice,"" he
said.</p>
              <p>All those in the container were pronounced dead at the scene
after the emergency services were called to the Waterglade
Industrial Park, not far from docks on the River Thames.</p>
              <p>Police said the trailer had travelled from Belgium to
Purfleet and landed shortly after 12.30 a.m. on Wednesday (2330
GMT Tuesday). It left the port on the truck at about 1.05 a.m.
and ambulance services notified police about the discovery of
the bodies at 1.40 a.m.</p>
              <p>Originally it was thought both parts of the vehicle had
entered Britain at Holyhead in North Wales on Saturday and to
have originally started its journey in Bulgaria.</p>
              <p>The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry said while the vehicle was
registered in Bulgaria by a company owned by an Irish woman on
June 19, 2017, it had left the next day and never returned.</p>
              <p>Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said his country had
no other connection with the deaths.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>""DESPERATE AND DANGEROUS SITUATION""</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said Irish authorities would
carry out any investigations necessary if it was established
that the truck had passed through Ireland.</p>
              <p>Police officers in forensic suits spent the day inspecting
the large white container on the truck next to warehouses and
had sealed off much of the surrounding area of the industrial
site with large green barriers as they carried out their
investigation.</p>
              <p>The truck was later driven away to a secure location at
nearby Tilbury Docks so the bodies could be recovered.</p>
              <p>""At this stage, we have not identified where the victims are

many San Francisco residents, freshly minted coder David Brooks
aspires to join the city's famed technology workforce as an
engineer.</p>
              <p>What gives him an edge, he believes, is his empathy and
ability to problem solve – life skills honed from being homeless
for the past four years.</p>

Tenderloin, which, beyond providing coding courses, helps
homeless people and other marginalized groups find jobs with
local tech companies such as LinkedIn or Survey Monkey.</p>
              <p>Brooks lives in a motorhome in a relatively safe area of the
city, but will soon be displaced from his parking spot by a new
property.</p>
              <p>""It's kind of scary ... I saw this happening and that is why

massive housing crises,"" said Jennifer Friedenbach, executive
director of the advocacy group Coalition on Homelessness.</p>
              <p>""Thousands of poor people have been displaced and ended up
homeless.""</p>
              <p>In January 2019 there were more than 8,000 homeless people
living in San Francisco, up 17% from 2017, according to official
data. Friedenbach said the true figure was likely in the tens of
thousands when the hidden homeless were included.</p>
              <p>In recent years, tensions over the homelessness problem have
risen. Tents line the streets and parks of a city that covers
less than 50 square miles (130 sq km) and is home to 900,000
people.</p>
              <p>The city has the highest median rent for a one-bedroom
apartment in the United States at about $3,700 a month,

change is hampering peacebuilding in Somalia as droughts and
floods strengthen the hand of militants and weaken the power of
government, a report said on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)
said three decades of conflict - coupled with increasingly
severe droughts - were posing serious challenges to the United
Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM).</p>
              <p>UNSOM has been in the east African nation since 2013 to
advise government on how best to cement peace, be it disarming
fighters or bringing rival communities together.</p>

has on pretty much every element of UNSOM's mandate,"" report
co-author Florian Krampe told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p>""Climate change deeply burdens UNSOM in its work to provide
peace and security, and also in its efforts to establish
functioning governance and judicial systems.""</p>
              <p>He said people escaping weather crises were vulnerable to
recruitment by militants, crowded camps became hot beds for
traffickers and more fights erupted over resources. Militants
also exploited climate crises to win legitimacy, he added.</p>
              <p>The overthrow of President Siad Barre in 1991 plunged

              <p>HORN OF AFRICA</p>
              <p>Climate change is taking a toll right across the Horn of
Africa, with increasingly erratic weather and low rainfall
common in Kenya, Somalia, Uganda and Ethiopia.</p>
              <p>The recurring dry spells destroy crops and pastures, pushing
millions of people to the brink of extreme hunger.</p>
              <p>According to the U.N., more than 2.5 million people in
Somalia have been forced from their homes by drought and
insecurity in recent years; many are now at risk of starvation.</p>
              <p>The report said rising conflict between cattle herders and
farmers over water and land was a challenge for UNSOM, while
people on the move were vulnerable to recruitment by Al Shabaab.</p>
              <p>""Climate impacts have contributed to an increase in the
number of IDPs (internally displaced people) that moved to urban
areas, such as Mogadishu, and who are living in improvised
camps,"" said the report.</p>
              <p>""These camps have become hotspots for criminal activities
such as human trafficking and child exploitation, and a
recruitment ground for Al Shabaab.""</p>
              <p>A pickup in migration has also robbed UNSOM of the elders
who typically mediate conflicts, leaving a gap in local
governance, researchers added.</p>
              <p>The report found Al Shabaab had learned to take advantage of
natural disasters by helping victims and legitimising its power.</p>
              <p>""Al Shabaab collects food and money through its distribution
centres, to provide disaster relief to those affected,"" it said.</p>
              <p>""The increasingly cyclical occurrence of drought, flood and
famine assures Al Shabaab the opportunity to showcase its
position as a relief provider.""</p>
              <p>UNSOM said it ""broadly"" agreed with the report, but disputed
researchers' belief there was a lack of donor awareness about
the heavy social impact of environmental problems.

Africa, with increasingly erratic weather and low rainfall
common in Kenya, Somalia, Uganda and Ethiopia.
The recurring dry spells destroy crops and pastures, pushing
millions of people to the brink of extreme hunger.
According to the U.N., more than 2.5 million people in
Somalia have been forced from their homes by drought and
insecurity in recent years; many are now at risk of starvation.
The report said rising conflict between cattle herders and
farmers over water and land was a challenge for UNSOM, while
people on the move were vulnerable to recruitment by Al Shabaab.
""Climate impacts have contributed to an increase in the
number of IDPs (internally displaced people) that moved to urban
areas, such as Mogadishu, and who are living in improvised
camps,"" said the report.
""These camps have become hotspots for criminal activities
such as human trafficking and child exploitation, and a
recruitment ground for Al Shabaab.""
A pickup in migration has also robbed UNSOM of the elders
who typically mediate conflicts, leaving a gap in local
governance, researchers added.
The report found Al Shabaab had learned to take advantage of
natural disasters by helping victims and legitimising its power.
""Al Shabaab collects food and money through its distribution
centres, to provide disaster relief to those affected,"" it said.
""The increasingly cyclical occurrence of drought, flood and
famine assures Al Shabaab the opportunity to showcase its
position as a relief provider.""
UNSOM said it ""broadly"" agreed with the report, but disputed
researchers' belief there was a lack of donor awareness about
the heavy social impact of environmental problems.

              <p>ADDIS ABABA, Oct 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From
ex-prostitutes making jewellery out of bullet casing to drones
delivering blood, rising numbers of businesses with a mission to
help address social problems are emerging in Ethiopia as the
economy opens up.</p>
              <p>An estimated 55,000 social enterprises operate in Ethiopia,
the second-most populous country in Africa and fastest growing
economy in the region where about a quarter of 109 million
people live below the poverty line, according to the World Bank.</p>
              <p>But the number of ventures set up to do good is on the rise
since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came in 18 months ago and vowed
to open the economy to private investment, raising hopes of
official recognition for the sector and easier access to funds.</p>
              <p>Kibret Abebe, one of Ethiopia's best-known social
entrepreneurs, said the sector would be boosted as Ethiopia
hosts the 12th annual Social Enterprise World Forum (SEWF) this
week, the first developing country to do so.</p>
              <p>""The economy is opening up and we are seeing more social
enterprises in Ethiopia,"" said Abebe, first president of Social
Enterprise Ethiopia, which was set up last year to advance firms
set up to do good that re-invest their profits into their work.</p>
              <p>""Scaling up has been a nightmare in Ethiopia and it's been
hard to collaborate with the government but I'm optimistic this
will change as we have a lot of social problems to fix.""</p>
              <p>Ethiopia's Education Minister Tilaye Gete said hosting SEWF,
attended by more than 1,200 delegates from 50 or so countries,
was a sign of change under Ahmed, who was awarded the Nobel
Peace Prize earlier this month.</p>
              <p>""This is reflective of the overall change in leadership and
mindset across the country,"" said Gete as he officially opened
the three-day conference.</p>
              <p>Abebe, an anaesthetist, was a trailblazer for social
enterprise in Ethiopia when he sold his house to set up TEBITA
Ambulance more than a decade ago after seeing how many road
accident victims struggled to get transport to medical help.</p>
              <p>TEBITA now runs a fleet of 20 ambulances and a college
training paramedics, funding its work by charging patients for
journeys, offering training, as well as providing emergency
services for the national football team.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>HEALTH TO HOUSING</p>
              <p>Abebe said TEBITA was one of thousands of social enterprises
in Ethiopia aiming to help the most needy, with newcomers
focused on agriculture, education, health, housing and IT.</p>
              <p>For example Maisha Technologies PLC is a tech-based social
enterprise trialling advanced drones to deliver blood to health
centres in rural areas where half of maternal deaths occur.</p>
              <p>HelloSolar aims to provide rural communities without
electricity with off-grid energy and affordable payment plans.</p>
              <p>Abebe said young people - with 43% of the population aged
15 or under - were playing a key role in advancing new social
enterprises, many with tech solutions and hoping to create jobs
for the future.</p>
              <p>A 2016 survey by the British Council - which co-hosts SEWF
with local partners - estimated the number of social enterprises
in Ethiopia and found about half were led by people aged under
35 while women led more than a quarter of social enterprises.</p>
              <p>But these firms reported numerous challenges, including the
lack of a policy framework with no distinct formal legal form or
recognised means to register as social enterprises in Ethiopia.</p>
              <p>The biggest barrier, however, was found to be financial -
accessing capital or obtaining grants - so it was critical to
find a revenue stream and one strong enough to support growth.</p>
              <p>Ellilta Products, for example, was set up 2012 to support
sister organisation, Ellilta Women at Risk (EWAR), founded in
1995 to help break the generational cycle of prostitution.</p>
              <p>Headquartered on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, Ellilta
Products' workforce of about 55 includes former prostitutes
making jewellery from bullet casing and scarves and soaps that
are sold locally and overseas to fund the work of EWAR.</p>
              <p>EWAR workers visit red light areas in Addis Ababa to
encourage women to join a year-long rehabilitation programme of
counselling and training while their children go to school.</p>
              <p>Ellilta Products' General Manager Emnet Mersha Seyoum said
so far EWAR has rescued around 1,000 women, with a success rate
of 90% not returning to prostitution.</p>
              <p>Anchilu Alemu, aged about 50, said she was rescued nine
years ago after 18 years as a prostitute and this has given her
and her daughter a new life. She makes scarves at Ellilta and
her daughter went to college and is now married with a child.</p>
              <p>""Before prostitution was the only way I could make money.
This saved me,"" she said as she pulled at a spool of yarn.</p>
              <p>Seyoum said it had been hard to get funding in Ethiopia as
the government did not recognise or understand social
enterprises but she hoped this would change under Ahmed and with
the SEWF in Addis, attended by 1,200 people from 58 nations.</p>
              <p>""Ideally in the future we want to scale up to grow tenfold
so that we can provide jobs to all of the women that we rescue,""
she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

              <p>WASHINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Candidates running for the
2020 Democratic presidential nomination have been uniformly
critical of the immigration policies of U.S. President Donald
Trump, who was elected after promising to crack down on illegal
immigration and bolster enforcement along the U.S.-Mexico
border.</p>
              <p>Since entering the White House in 2017, Trump has moved to
end former President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for
Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which  protects immigrants
brought illegally to the United States as children from
deportation.</p>
              <p>He has also curtailed immigration from majority-Muslim
countries, as well as temporarily instituted a policy along the
U.S.-Mexico border separating children from parents or guardians
with whom they crossed the border and holding them in separate
facilities.</p>
              <p>Democrats have largely condemned Trump's approach to
immigration, and the candidates leading the field to take on
Trump in November 2020 have sought to contrast their stances
with that of the Republican president.</p>
              <p>Here is a look at the immigration positions of the leading
Democratic candidates:</p>
              <p/>
              <p>JOE BIDEN</p>
              <p>Biden struggled in early presidential debates to defend some
immigration measures taken by former President Barack Obama when
Biden was his vice president, including the deportation of more
than 3 million immigrants between 2009 and 2016, setting a
record. Biden said Obama ""did the best thing that was able to be
done"" and pointed to Obama's creation of DACA, which the Trump
administration wants to end. At another debate, Biden said
undocumented immigrants needed to ""get in line"" and that the
United States has the authority to prioritize those with needed
skills or advanced degrees. His campaign has said Biden supports
working with the U.S. Congress to make comprehensive immigration
changes, including a pathway to citizenship for some
undocumented immigrants. Biden has not released a detailed
immigration plan.</p>
              <p>ELIZABETH WARREN</p>
              <p>Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, has said she
would decriminalize migration by immediately issuing guidance to
federal prosecutors that they not pursue cases related to
administrative immigration violations. She would also separate
immigration and law enforcement agencies into separate entities,
and reshape the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) and U.S.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) ""from top to bottom.""
Warren would eliminate privately owned immigration detention
facilities and only detain those who are a flight risk. She
would create an immigration court system independent from the
U.S. Department of Justice and increase the number of refugees
allowed into the country. She would work with Congress to pass
comprehensive immigration legislation that would create a path
to citizenship.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>BERNIE SANDERS</p>
              <p>Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, says he would work
with Congress to pass a comprehensive immigration bill that
includes a pathway to citizenship. He favors providing immediate
legal status for those eligible for DACA. Sanders voted against
creating ICE and would seek to restructure it. Sanders has said
the surge of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border is a ""serious
problem"" but criticized the Trump administration's detention
policies. He has said he opposes open borders, which he believes
would strain government resources and make it more difficult to
enact other policies he champions such as universal healthcare
and free college tuition.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>PETE BUTTIGIEG</p>
              <p>Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has said he
supports the DACA program and immigration legislation that
includes a pathway to citizenship. He has criticized the Trump
administration's move to send troops to the U.S.-Mexico border
as a waste of time. Buttigieg wants to evaluate ICE and CBP
policies to ensure there will be no future family separations
along the U.S.-Mexico border. He has also said he would aim to
reduce backlogs in the immigration and asylum processes.</p>
              <p>KAMALA HARRIS</p>
              <p>Harris, a U.S. senator from California and its former top
prosecutor, has said that Congress must pass a comprehensive
immigration overhaul but, given its inability to do so, her plan
rests on the president's executive power. She would use that
authority to create a path to citizenship for young immigrants,
and expand the DACA program to cover parents of U.S. citizens
and legal permanent residents, veterans and undocumented
immigrants who have been in the United States for many years.
She has said she would support overhauling ICE.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>AMY KLOBUCHAR</p>
              <p>Klobuchar, a U.S. senator from Minnesota, has supported
efforts to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul in Congress
and says she believes that a pathway to citizenship should be
created for all immigrants already in the U.S. legally. She
sponsored a bill that would have prevented the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) from sharing most DACA recipients'
information with ICE, CBP or the Justice Department. She has
argued that the families of active-duty military members should
be protected from deportation.</p>
              <p>ANDREW YANG</p>
              <p>Yang, a technology entrepreneur, supports legislation
languishing in Congress known as the DREAM Act, which would
permanently protect DACA youth from deportation and provide them
with a pathway to citizenship. He favors increasing the
guest-worker program, while making sure workers leave when the
approved time is up. He has said any pathway to citizenship
created for undocumented immigrants should ""reflect the fact
that these individuals tried to circumvent our legal immigration
system.""</p>
              <p/>
              <p>CORY BOOKER</p>
              <p>Booker, a U.S. senator from New Jersey, has said ""we can't
wait for Congress to act"" on immigration and would, on his first
day in office, use the president's executive power to make
sweeping changes. He would restore DACA protections and end
spending on the Trump administration's wall along the
U.S.-Mexico border. Booker would direct DHS to require its
immigration facilities to meet standards set by the American Bar
Association and expand legal counsel for undocumented
immigrants. Booker has said he would lift Trump administration
restrictions on immigration from majority-Muslim countries and
phase out the use of privately owned prisons.</p>
              <p>BETO O'ROURKE</p>
              <p>O'Rourke, a former U.S. representative from Texas, has said
""on day one of his presidency"" he would use the executive power
of the office to protect ""Dreamer"" immigrants from deportation
and reunite families that have been separated along the
U.S.-Mexico border. He would lift Trump administration
restrictions on immigration from predominantly Muslim countries.
O'Rourke would also take steps to increase staffing to expedite
the asylum process, make immigration courts independent from the
Department of Justice and deploy up to 2,000 lawyers to the
U.S.-Mexico border to provide immigrants with legal counsel.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>JULIAN CASTRO</p>
              <p>Castro, a secretary of housing and urban development during
the Obama administration, has made overhauling the U.S.
immigration system a centerpiece of his campaign. The former
mayor of San Antonio, Texas, supports immigration legislation
providing a pathway to citizenship and permanently protecting
DACA recipients from deportation. He says he would reduce or
eliminate a backlog of 4.4 million waiting for visas in part by
allowing spouses and children of permanent residents to
immediately reunite with their family members in the United
States. He would eliminate per-country visa limits, end
Trump-era restrictions on immigration from majority-Muslim
countries and increase the admission of refugees. He would end
the practice of deporting veterans who had served in the U.S.
armed forces and allow those who have been deported to return.
He would overhaul ICE and direct CBP to focus on human
trafficking.</p>
              <p>TULSI GABBARD</p>
              <p>Gabbard, a U.S. representative from Hawaii and combat
veteran, supports permanently protecting DACA recipients from
deportation. She backed legislation that would remove
per-country caps on employment-based green cards. She joined
with Republicans to support a 2015 bill that would have added
extra vetting requirements for refugees from Syria and Iraq.</p>
              <p>TOM STEYER</p>
              <p>Billionaire climate activist Steyer has donated millions to
legal aid groups helping immigrants facing deportation. He has
praised the contributions immigrants make to U.S. society.
NextGen, a liberal advocacy group he founded, states that ""a
system that depends upon the labor of immigrants, but fails to
offer a path to citizenship, is inherently unjust.""

              <p>As people live longer, the World Health Organization
predicts that one in five - 2 billion people - will be aged 60
or older by 2050, double that of 2015.</p>
              <p>And ageing populations all over the world are already
putting pressure on healthcare, infrastructure, housing and
other social services.</p>
              <p>Finding surprising ways to keep older people mentally and

nearly 80 cities, towns and regions taking part in this year's

              <p>Launched by the European Commission in 2012, the partnership
aims to improve the health and quality of life of older
citizens, such as those suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's

              <p>The initiative wants to add two years to the average healthy
lifespan of European Union citizens by 2020 - which currently
stands at about 64 years.</p>
              <p>Anca Paduraru, the European Commission's spokeswoman for

12 and 15 km (7-9 miles) every day playing the game.</p>
              <p>Catching Pokemon is a good way of meeting people and getting

              <p>RELIEVING ISOLATION</p>
              <p>Pokemon Go can be ""a good way of connecting people with

worker who works with people suffering from loneliness and other
living difficulties in Badalona.</p>

to some of his clients.</p>
              <p>Jordi Piera Jimenez, chief information and R&amp;D officer at

adding that ""more and more people are coming to live in cities

              <p>Almost 70% of the world's population is expected to be

BADALONA, Spain, Oct 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - At
first, when she retired from a lifelong career in nursing in her
native Spain, Joanna Perez Osuna struggled with a lack of
purpose. Then she found solace in a virtual world populated by
""Pikachus"", ""Weedles"" and ""Smeargles"".
Perez started playing Pokemon Go, the augmented-reality game
that encourages players to travel around looking through their
mobile phone cameras so they can collect animated creatures that
""appear"" in front of them.
Now the 75-year-old spends up to six hours a day walking the
streets of of Badalona, a quiet Spanish town to the north of
Barcelona, chasing after digital ghosts, dragons and monsters.
""I don't want to be stuck at home all afternoon watching
television. I also don't want to sit around all day reflecting
with people my age – I want to do something in the fresh air,""
Perez told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, chuckling.
As people live longer, the World Health Organization
predicts that one in five - 2 billion people - will be aged 60
or older by 2050, double that of 2015.
And ageing populations all over the world are already
putting pressure on healthcare, infrastructure, housing and
other social services.
Finding surprising ways to keep older people mentally and
physically healthy is a point of pride for Badalona, one of
nearly 80 cities, towns and regions taking part in this year's
European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing.
Launched by the European Commission in 2012, the partnership
aims to improve the health and quality of life of older
citizens, such as those suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's
disease.
The initiative wants to add two years to the average healthy
lifespan of European Union citizens by 2020 - which currently
stands at about 64 years.
Anca Paduraru, the European Commission's spokeswoman for
public health projects, said countries should see ageing as ""an
opportunity to innovate"" and modernise health systems.
Perez, who was introduced to Pokemon Go by her daughter
after it first launched three years ago, said she walks between
12 and 15 km (7-9 miles) every day playing the game.
Catching Pokemon is a good way of meeting people and getting
to know Badalona better, she explained, because it takes her to
neighbourhoods she would not normally visit.
And she is motivated by the health benefits of playing the
game, which have helped her recover after she suffered a bout of
skin cancer.
""One of the main reasons I play is to not put on too much
weight – that's important,"" she said.

RELIEVING ISOLATION
Pokemon Go can be ""a good way of connecting people with
others so they are less isolated,"" said Carlos Sanchez, a social
worker who works with people suffering from loneliness and other
living difficulties in Badalona.
""It's most useful for people that don't have anything to
fill their time, like if they don't have grandchildren to pick
up from school,"" he stressed, adding that he recommends the game
to some of his clients.
Jordi Piera Jimenez, chief information and R&D officer at
public healthcare provider Badalona Care Services, agreed,
adding that ""more and more people are coming to live in cities
and isolation is becoming a huge problem"".
Almost 70% of the world's population is expected to be
living in urban areas by 2050, according to the United Nations.
""Isolation and a feeling of loneliness are problems that in
rural areas are less common, because people are more resilient
and used to taking care of each other ... Cities tend to be more
impersonal,"" Piera lamented.
Spotting unmet demand, technology and toy companies are
marketing devices such as robotic pets, like the therapeutic
seal from Japanese company Paro which remembers how it has been
stroked and responds to certain words.
There are also glasses from French firm Abeye that can call
for help when they detect the wearer has taken a fall and
artificial intelligence products like ElliQ, which initiates
conversation to keep older people company.
In Badalona, at least 300 residents aged 65 and over are
using or have used Pokemon Go, Piera said.

FINANCING PRESSURES
Badalona - which, unlike most cities, owns its public
healthcare system - is promoting and testing the use of digital
healthcare solutions but is held back by funding issues, said
Piera.
""We have some digital solutions deployed but not at the
scale that we want to and not at the scale that we have tried,""
he said.
""We have tested a lot of things and we know that they work
but making them real is very hard ... the government is not

populations will be more common once the cost of new technology

SEOUL, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The animosity between Japan and
South Korea is entwined with the history of Japan's 1910-45
occupation of the Korean peninsula, the mobilisation of forced
labour at companies and women in wartime brothels, and a row
over the ownership of islets in the sea between the two nations.
Here is an outline of the issues that bedevil their ties:

FORCED LABOUR
Last October, South Korea's Supreme Court ordered Japan's
Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp and Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries to compensate some wartime forced labourers.
The ruling infuriated Tokyo, which sees the former
labourers' right to reparation ceased under a 1965 treaty
normalising diplomatic ties.
Relations deteriorated when Japan restricted exports of
high-tech material to South Korea in July, while a group of
former labourers requested a court order to forcibly liquidate
Mitsubishi assets for compensation.
Thousands of South Koreans protested condemning what they
called Japan's ""economic invasion.""
Last week, a commercial by Japanese clothing brand Uniqlo
stirred a backlash in South Korea as mocking victims of forced
labour and comfort women, prompting a parody video featuring a
90-year-old woman who worked for Mitsubishi to go viral.
Yang Kee-ho, a professor of Japanese Studies at Sungkonghoe
University in Seoul, said the two sides were far apart.
""But it could get even worse if the asset sale of Japanese
firms is materialised, so it's good to listen and talk to the
Japanese to see if they can find a new, creative way out.""

'COMFORT WOMEN'
Reminders of Japan's rule are inflammatory for both sides,
but the issue of ""comfort women,"" a Japanese euphemism for
women, many of them Korean, forced into wartime brothels, is
particularly contentious.
Many surviving South Korean victims demand Japan's formal
apology and compensation.
Japan says the matter of compensation for the women was
settled under the 1965 treaty.
In 2015, South Korea and Japan reached a settlement under
which Tokyo issued an official apology and provided 1 billion
yen ($9.23 million) to a fund to help the victims.
Taking office two years later, South Korean President Moon
Jae-in dissolved the fund, effectively scrapping the agreement,
a move that analysts said convinced Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe the South Korean leader was deceitful.
Tokyo wants Seoul to remove a statue near the Japanese
embassy in Seoul commemorating the comfort women, and another
next to the Japanese consulate in Busan.
Some comfort women victims continue their weekly protest in
front of the embassy.

ISLETS
The two countries also have a territorial dispute which
flared this month when South Korea flew fighter jets over a set
of remote islands marking its Armed Forces Day.
The windswept volcanic islets, known as Dokdo in Korea and
Takeshima in Japan, are controlled by Seoul with a small band of
coast guards although also claimed by Tokyo.
The cluster sit astride fertile fishing grounds and possibly
enormous deposits of natural gas hydrate that could be worth
billions of dollars, experts say.
The territorial feud is emotional for Koreans, who say the
islands, recorded as part of their territory since 512, were the
first land seized by Japan as part of forcible occupation of the
peninsula.
Japan argues the islands were never part of Korea and it had
established sovereignty by the mid-17th century as a stop-over
point for its fishermen.
Seoul rejects Tokyo's proposal to refer the dispute to the
International Court of Justice.
In 2017, Japan complained after Moon served visiting U.S.
President Donald Trump a dish called ""Dokdo shrimp,"" and invited
a comfort women survivor to a banquet for Trump.

              <p>MACHAKOS, Kenya, Oct 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - For
the past two years, Beatrice Ndavi, a 56-year-old farmer in
central Kenya, has received vouchers for good-quality seeds and
fertiliser, as well as training to improve her yields.</p>
              <p>The support is offered on credit as part of an insurance
scheme that provides security for the farmer’s loan by paying it
down if her harvest is damaged by extreme weather.</p>
              <p>Ndavi, a mother of six from Masii village in Machakos
County, explained that in the past, farmers ended up taking out
cash loans to cover their needs in an emergency, which they then
struggled to pay back.</p>
              <p>But under the Risk-Contingent Credit (RCC) scheme she is
part of, it has become easier for her to keep going, even if the
weather is bad, she said.</p>
              <p>“I get the right farm inputs - quality seeds and fertilisers
on time - and I’m not worried about how to repay the loan as
it’s insured,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>RAIN-BASED PAYOUTS</p>
              <p>Millions of rural households in Kenya rely on agriculture
for their income, but a warming climate is bringing more intense
and frequent droughts, disrupting production.</p>
              <p>Recurring losses due to sometimes consecutive years of
drought, coupled with the high cost of certified seeds and other
inputs, have made poor farmers reluctant to invest in their
land, organisations working on the RCC project found.</p>
              <p>Apurba Shee, lead researcher with the Natural Resources
Institute at Britain’s University of Greenwich, said the credit
scheme differs from traditional insurance as it takes into
account rainfall patterns as they unfold rather than paying out
only when harvests fail.</p>
              <p>Remote-sensing satellite technology is used to track
rainfall in real-time, and if the average drops below a set
threshold in any 21-day period during the growing season, it
triggers digital payouts that cover farmers’ loans.</p>
              <p>The system allows for multiple payments spread throughout
the season, as rain volumes fluctuate, Shee said.</p>
              <p>The RCC programme aims to tackle both credit constraints and
risks linked to drought, he said in an interview.</p>
              <p>“We are getting clear positive indications in term of
increased farming investments (and) farmers going back to
farming more often, even after a devastating drought,” he added.</p>
              <p>According to a 2018 survey, nearly 1,200 farmers in Machakos
had enrolled in the RCC scheme, with 40% taking out insured
loans to buy farm inputs.</p>
              <p>The average amount they received was 8,500 Kenyan shillings
($82), compared with 6,000 shillings ($58) for traditional
loans.</p>
              <p>In the neighbouring county of Embu, about 800 farmers are
taking part in the U.S. government-backed project.</p>
              <p>Shee said the RCC scheme had now proved itself to be
commercially viable and had the potential to be expanded to
other parts of Kenya and semi-arid regions across southern and
eastern Africa, as well as along the borders of the Sahara.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>DWINDLING CAPITAL</p>
              <p>Before joining the scheme, Ndavi struggled when persistent
drought brought water shortages, as she – like many other
farmers in Kenya’s drylands – relies on regular rainfall to keep
her crops in good health.</p>
              <p>In 2017, she lost five acres of planted maize worth $100
because of drought.</p>
              <p>“I didn’t have any other means of recovering my losses, so I
went back to my savings to farm again in the following season,”
she said, pointing to her land, which was again dry and bare.</p>
              <p>More severe droughts are leaving many farmers increasingly
vulnerable and with less capital to invest in their business,
said Sarfraz Shah, project manager at Nairobi-based APA
Insurance, which underwrites the RCC scheme.</p>
              <p>Some farmers are wary of borrowing money, and in other
cases, financial institutions are reluctant to lend to them,
viewing them as high risk – which feeds into a vicious circle of
lower productivity, he noted.</p>
              <p>“If there is no loan given to these smallholder farmers,
they will not be able to farm - but the beauty of this insurance
is, if there is bad weather, we pay claims,” Shah said.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>CONFIDENCE BOOST</p>
              <p>Moses Kyalo, another farmer from Masii village, said his
farm had become more sustainable since he signed up to the RCC
scheme in 2017, giving him access to training and insured credit
to help boost production.</p>
              <p>Last year, he took out a loan for 10,000 shillings and
received seeds and fertiliser in lieu of cash.</p>
              <p>His crops did not do well because of insufficient rain, but
the loan insurance paid off part of his losses, he said.</p>
              <p>“It gave me confidence to increase my investments into

              <p>Farmers in the RCC scheme also receive training in

              <p>Willis Ogutu Odhiambo, an agricultural field officer with

MACHAKOS, Kenya, Oct 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - For
the past two years, Beatrice Ndavi, a 56-year-old farmer in
central Kenya, has received vouchers for good-quality seeds and
fertiliser, as well as training to improve her yields.
The support is offered on credit as part of an insurance

“I get the right farm inputs - quality seeds and fertilisers

RAIN-BASED PAYOUTS
Millions of rural households in Kenya rely on agriculture
for their income, but a warming climate is bringing more intense
and frequent droughts, disrupting production.
Recurring losses due to sometimes consecutive years of
drought, coupled with the high cost of certified seeds and other
inputs, have made poor farmers reluctant to invest in their
land, organisations working on the RCC project found.
Apurba Shee, lead researcher with the Natural Resources
Institute at Britain’s University of Greenwich, said the credit
scheme differs from traditional insurance as it takes into
account rainfall patterns as they unfold rather than paying out
only when harvests fail.
Remote-sensing satellite technology is used to track
rainfall in real-time, and if the average drops below a set
threshold in any 21-day period during the growing season, it
triggers digital payouts that cover farmers’ loans.
The system allows for multiple payments spread throughout
the season, as rain volumes fluctuate, Shee said.
The RCC programme aims to tackle both credit constraints and
risks linked to drought, he said in an interview.
“We are getting clear positive indications in term of
increased farming investments (and) farmers going back to
farming more often, even after a devastating drought,” he added.
According to a 2018 survey, nearly 1,200 farmers in Machakos
had enrolled in the RCC scheme, with 40% taking out insured
loans to buy farm inputs.
The average amount they received was 8,500 Kenyan shillings
($82), compared with 6,000 shillings ($58) for traditional
loans.
In the neighbouring county of Embu, about 800 farmers are
taking part in the U.S. government-backed project.
Shee said the RCC scheme had now proved itself to be
commercially viable and had the potential to be expanded to
other parts of Kenya and semi-arid regions across southern and
eastern Africa, as well as along the borders of the Sahara.

DWINDLING CAPITAL
Before joining the scheme, Ndavi struggled when persistent
drought brought water shortages, as she – like many other

              <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday again waded into America's fraught racial history by labelling the impeachment inquiry against him a ""lynching"" - language that conjured memories of decades of killings of thousands of black people - drawing swift bipartisan condemnation.</p>

              <p>WASHINGTON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump
on Tuesday again waded into America's fraught racial history by
labeling the impeachment inquiry against him a ""lynching"" -
language that conjured memories of decades of killings of
thousands of black people - drawing swift bipartisan
condemnation.</p>
              <p>""All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here
- a lynching. But we will WIN!"" Trump wrote on Twitter,
referring to the impeachment inquiry https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whistleblower/envoy-testifies-trump-tied-ukraine-aid-to-politically-motivated-investigations-idUSKBN1X10BC
in the Democratic-led House of Representatives focusing on his
request that Ukraine investigate a domestic political rival,
Democrat Joe Biden.</p>
              <p>Lynching refers to the murder of thousands of Americans,
most of them black, between the 1880s and 1960s, as
African-Americans struggled for their rights as U.S. citizens in
the aftermath of the Civil War in which Southern states fought
in vain to maintain black slavery.</p>
              <p>""The president should not compare a constitutionally
mandated impeachment inquiry to such a dangerous and dark
chapter of American history. It's irresponsible for him to do
so, and I hope that he will apologize,"" said House Democratic

              <p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said,
""Given the history in our country, I would not compare this to a
lynching. That was an unfortunate choice of words."" McConnell
added that he viewed the House inquiry as ""an unfair process""
that is denying Trump ""procedural safeguards.""</p>
              <p>Democrats and other critics have previously accused Trump of
stoking racial divisions while trying to appeal to his largely
white core of conservative Republican voters, noting his comment
in 2017 that there were ""very fine people on both sides"" at a
rally by white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia in
which a counter-protester was killed.</p>
              <p>Some Republican allies agreed with Trump's use of the word
lynching.</p>
              <p>""It shows a lot of things about our national media. When
it's about Trump, who cares about the process, as long as you
get him. So, yeah, this is a lynching in every sense. This is
un-American,"" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, whose home
state of South Carolina has a large black population, told
reporters.</p>
              <p>Trump has a long and controversial history on race including
decades-old allegations of discrimination in his family's real
estate business. He also championed the death penalty for five
black and Latino teens wrongly accused of raping a white woman
in 1989 in New York's Central Park, used an expletive to
describe African countries in 2018, and singled out black
athletes for criticism after they failed to stand for the
national anthem while protesting racial inequity.</p>

              <p>'HISTORICAL TRAGEDIES'</p>
              <p>Trump's lynching comment was immediately condemned by
critics as unbecoming of a president.</p>
              <p>""For him to say something like that was disgusting, reflects
his insensitivity toward the historical tragedies of this
country,"" said Representative Barbara Lee, who said she was not
surprised or shocked by Trump's comments but ""just very, very
disappointed.""</p>
              <p>""For Trump to characterize a legal impeachment inquiry as a
lynching shows a complete disrespect for the thousands of Black
people lynched - murdered - throughout our nation's history in
acts of racism and hatred,"" said Karen Baynes-Dunning, interim
president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which advocates
for equal opportunity and fights bigotry.</p>
              <p>The impeachment inquiry is focused on Trump's request during
a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelenskiy that he investigate a domestic political rival, former
vice president Joe Biden. Biden is a leading contender to become
the Democratic 2020 presidential nominee to run against Trump.</p>
              <p>Biden said on Twitter that Trump's use of the word was
""abhorrent"" and ""despicable.""</p>
              <p>Biden, however, said in 1998 the impeachment of President
Bill Clinton could be seen as a ""partisan lynching."" Biden
apologized in a tweet late on Tuesday, saying it ""wasn't the
right word to use and I’m sorry about that.""</p>
              <p>Senator Tim Scott, the only black Republican U.S. senator
and one of just two black Republicans in Congress, said of
Trump's comment, ""I get his absolute rejection of the process,""

              <p>ADDIS ABABA, Oct 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From
ex-prostitutes making jewellery out of bullet casing to drones
delivering blood, rising numbers of businesses with a mission to
help address social problems are emerging in Ethiopia as the
economy opens up.</p>
              <p>An estimated 55,000 social enterprises operate in Ethiopia,
the second-most populous country in Africa and fastest growing
economy in the region where about a quarter of 109 million
people live below the poverty line, according to the World Bank.</p>
              <p>But the number of ventures set up to do good is on the rise
since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came in 18 months ago and vowed
to open the economy to private investment, raising hopes of
official recognition for the sector and easier access to funds.</p>
              <p>Kibret Abebe, one of Ethiopia's best-known social
entrepreneurs, said the sector would be boosted as Ethiopia
hosts the 12th annual Social Enterprise World Forum (SEWF) this
week, the first developing country to do so.</p>
              <p>""The economy is opening up and we are seeing more social
enterprises in Ethiopia,"" said Abebe, first president of Social
Enterprise Ethiopia, which was set up last year to advance firms
set up to do good that re-invest their profits into their work.</p>
              <p>""Scaling up has been a nightmare in Ethiopia and it's been
hard to collaborate with the government but I'm optimistic this
will change as we have a lot of social problems to fix.""</p>
              <p>Abebe, an anaesthetist, was a trailblazer for social
enterprise in Ethiopia when he sold his house to set up TEBITA
Ambulance more than a decade ago after seeing how many road
accident victims struggled to get transport to medical help.</p>
              <p>TEBITA now runs a fleet of 20 ambulances and a college
training paramedics, funding its work by charging patients for
journeys, offering training, as well as providing emergency
services for the national football team.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>HEALTH TO HOUSING</p>
              <p>Abebe said TEBITA was one of thousands of social enterprises
in Ethiopia aiming to help the most needy, with newcomers
focused on agriculture, education, health, housing and IT.</p>
              <p>For example Maisha Technologies PLC is a tech-based social
enterprise trialling advanced drones to deliver blood to health
centres in rural areas where half of maternal deaths occur.</p>
              <p>HelloSolar aims to provide rural communities without
electricity with off-grid energy and affordable payment plans.</p>
              <p>Abebe said young people - with 43% of the population aged
15 or under - were playing a key role in advancing new social
enterprises, many with tech solutions and hoping to create jobs
for the future.</p>
              <p>A 2016 survey by the British Council - which co-hosts SEWF
with local partners - estimated the number of social enterprises
in Ethiopia and found about half were led by people aged under
35 while women led more than a quarter of social enterprises.</p>
              <p>But these firms reported numerous challenges, including the
lack of a policy framework with no distinct formal legal form or
recognised means to register as social enterprises in Ethiopia.</p>
              <p>The biggest barrier, however, was found to be financial -
accessing capital or obtaining grants - so it was critical to
find a revenue stream and one strong enough to support growth.</p>
              <p>Ellilta Products, for example, was set up 2012 to support
sister organisation, Ellilta Women at Risk (EWAR), founded in
1995 to help break the generational cycle of prostitution.</p>
              <p>Headquartered on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, Ellilta
Products' workforce of about 55 includes former prostitutes
making jewellery from bullet casing and scarves and soaps that
are sold locally and overseas to fund the work of EWAR.</p>
              <p>EWAR workers visit red light areas in Addis Ababa to
encourage women to join a year-long rehabilitation programme of
counselling and training while their children go to school.</p>
              <p>Ellilta Products' General Manager Emnet Mersha Seyoum said
so far EWAR has rescued around 1,000 women, with a success rate
of 90% not returning to prostitution.</p>
              <p>Anchilu Alemu, aged about 50, said she was rescued nine
years ago after 18 years as a prostitute and this has given her
and her daughter a new life. She makes scarves at Ellilta and
her daughter went to college and is now married with a child.</p>
              <p>""Before prostitution was the only way I could make money.
This saved me,"" she said as she pulled at a spool of yarn.</p>
              <p>Seyoum said it had been hard to get funding in Ethiopia as
the government did not recognise or understand social
enterprises but she hoped this would change under Ahmed and with
the SEWF in Addis, attended by 1,200 people from 58 nations.</p>
              <p>""Ideally in the future we want to scale up to grow tenfold
so that we can provide jobs to all of the women that we rescue,""
she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

the government did not recognise or understand social
enterprises but she hoped this would change under Ahmed and with
the SEWF in Addis, attended by 1,200 people from 58 nations.

              <p>ABUJA/LONDON, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When
Olamide Ayeni-Babajide discovered an expensive ornament she
purchased on a trip abroad was made of old corn husk it opened
her eyes to the potential of Nigeria's own waste problem.</p>
              <p>In 2016 she founded Pearl Recycling, which remodels solid
waste such as old tyres into furniture in Lagos, Africa's most
populous city with 21 million people and home to one of the
world's largest garbage sites.</p>
              <p>The social enterprise – a business that aims to do good – is
also looking to tackle Nigeria's youth unemployment problem,
training hundreds of young locals to recycle disused materials,
with most them going on to set up their own waste ventures.</p>
              <p>""Nigeria is a good place for social entrepreneurs because
there are diverse problems to be solved,"" said Ayeni-Babajide.</p>
              <p>The Thomson Reuters Foundation's second global poll on the
best country to be a social entrepreneur found the three African
nations among the world's 45 biggest economies surveyed -
Nigeria, Egypt and South Africa - failed to make the top 20.</p>
              <p>But Nigeria came sixth when about 900 social enterprise
experts were asked where young people are playing a key role in
the growing sector. Egypt came fourth and South Africa 34th in
the youth ranking in the poll, supported by Deutsche Bank.</p>
              <p>In Nigeria - a young country where the median age is about
18 - young people are rising to find business solutions to
challenges ranging from poverty to environmental and cultural
issues – from illiteracy to pollution – neglected by the
government.</p>
              <p>Facing a youth unemployment crisis – with more than half of
15-35 year olds out of work or not in full-time jobs – a new
generation of social entrepreneurs wants to create opportunities
and economic prosperity themselves.</p>
              <p>PASSION AND ENERGY</p>
              <p>Femi Taiwo, executive director of LEAP Africa, said
encouragement from faith-based organisations, motivational
speakers, an array of local and international programmes and
competitions for young leaders has helped pave the way.</p>
              <p>""These initiatives and many more put a spotlight on young
people making a change, and inspired many more to jump on the
bandwagon,"" said Taiwo, whose Lagos-based youth leadership
non-profit provides free training for social innovators.</p>
              <p>But with this zeal for social entrepreneurship comes risks.</p>
              <p>""The enthusiasm, the energy, the drive of young people is
incomparable,"" said Atinuke Lebile, 31, founder of Ibadan-based
social enterprise Cato Foods.</p>
              <p>""However, young people often lack experience and the
patience to learn,"" added Lebile, whose biotechnology business
aims to reduce malnutrition and poverty by creating fortified
food products, such as custard enriched with vitamins A and C.</p>
              <p>In addition to young people, women are increasingly well
represented in leadership positions in social enterprises in
Nigeria, which jumped to joint ninth place on this issue from
40th in the inaugural global poll in 2016.</p>
              <p>Ayeni-Babajide, 36, who worked as an engineer in a
male-dominated sector for almost a decade before founding Pearl
Recycling, finds Nigerians are gradually getting used to women
in leadership positions.</p>
              <p>""Women now know their rights and power they possess,"" she
said, but added that women still found it hard to access funds.</p>
              <p>""The majority of laid down rules are favouring men,
especially access to capital. Women need access to funds and an
enabling environment devoid of gender profiling to thrive.""</p>
              <p>Like Nigeria, in Egypt there has also been a concerted push
to support young social entrepreneurs, especially since the
country's 2011 uprising, said Iman Bibars of Ashoka Arab World,
a non-profit organisation that supports social entrepreneurs.</p>
              <p>Egypt, like Nigeria, has a large youth population with 34%
of people under the age of 14 compared to 44% in Nigeria,
according to World Bank data from 2018.</p>
              <p>""After the Arab Spring there was a lot of interest in the
youth, there were a lot of programmes by the government and
international donors and CSR [corporate social responsibility]
in trying to figure out how to support young people,"" she said.</p>
              <p>This year Ashoka Arab World launched a Young Changemakers
scheme with the British Council and social enterprise Red Ochre
to help support females aged 16-20 from rural Egypt develop
social enterprise ideas.</p>
              <p>Egypt rose to 22nd place from 29th three years ago when
asked if women were well represented in social enterprises.
South Africa was in 23rd place, also up from 29th.</p>
              <p>""The reason why young people are excited is it gives them an
opportunity to be leaders, it gives them an opportunity to be of
help to others and recognition, and this is something that young
people did not have before,"" said Bibars.</p>
              <p>""Since there are so many social problems in the country and
poverty, there is a lot of space for them to innovate.""

ABUJA/LONDON, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When
Olamide Ayeni-Babajide discovered an expensive ornament she
purchased on a trip abroad was made of old corn husk it opened
her eyes to the potential of Nigeria's own waste problem.
In 2016 she founded Pearl Recycling, which remodels solid
waste such as old tyres into furniture in Lagos, Africa's most
populous city with 21 million people and home to one of the
world's largest garbage sites.
The social enterprise – a business that aims to do good – is
also looking to tackle Nigeria's youth unemployment problem,
training hundreds of young locals to recycle disused materials,
with most them going on to set up their own waste ventures.
""Nigeria is a good place for social entrepreneurs because
there are diverse problems to be solved,"" said Ayeni-Babajide.
The Thomson Reuters Foundation's second global poll on the
best country to be a social entrepreneur found the three African
nations among the world's 45 biggest economies surveyed -
Nigeria, Egypt and South Africa - failed to make the top 20.
But Nigeria came sixth when about 900 social enterprise
experts were asked where young people are playing a key role in
the growing sector. Egypt came fourth and South Africa 34th in
the youth ranking in the poll, supported by Deutsche Bank.
In Nigeria - a young country where the median age is about
18 - young people are rising to find business solutions to
challenges ranging from poverty to environmental and cultural
issues – from illiteracy to pollution – neglected by the
government.
Facing a youth unemployment crisis – with more than half of
15-35 year olds out of work or not in full-time jobs – a new
generation of social entrepreneurs wants to create opportunities
and economic prosperity themselves.
PASSION AND ENERGY
Femi Taiwo, executive director of LEAP Africa, said
encouragement from faith-based organisations, motivational
speakers, an array of local and international programmes and
competitions for young leaders has helped pave the way.
""These initiatives and many more put a spotlight on young
people making a change, and inspired many more to jump on the
bandwagon,"" said Taiwo, whose Lagos-based youth leadership
non-profit provides free training for social innovators.
But with this zeal for social entrepreneurship comes risks.
""The enthusiasm, the energy, the drive of young people is
incomparable,"" said Atinuke Lebile, 31, founder of Ibadan-based
social enterprise Cato Foods.
""However, young people often lack experience and the
patience to learn,"" added Lebile, whose biotechnology business
aims to reduce malnutrition and poverty by creating fortified
food products, such as custard enriched with vitamins A and C.
In addition to young people, women are increasingly well
represented in leadership positions in social enterprises in
Nigeria, which jumped to joint ninth place on this issue from
40th in the inaugural global poll in 2016.
Ayeni-Babajide, 36, who worked as an engineer in a
male-dominated sector for almost a decade before founding Pearl
Recycling, finds Nigerians are gradually getting used to women
in leadership positions.
""Women now know their rights and power they possess,"" she
said, but added that women still found it hard to access funds.
""The majority of laid down rules are favouring men,
especially access to capital. Women need access to funds and an
enabling environment devoid of gender profiling to thrive.""
Like Nigeria, in Egypt there has also been a concerted push
to support young social entrepreneurs, especially since the
country's 2011 uprising, said Iman Bibars of Ashoka Arab World,
a non-profit organisation that supports social entrepreneurs.
Egypt, like Nigeria, has a large youth population with 34%
of people under the age of 14 compared to 44% in Nigeria,
according to World Bank data from 2018.
""After the Arab Spring there was a lot of interest in the
youth, there were a lot of programmes by the government and
international donors and CSR [corporate social responsibility]
in trying to figure out how to support young people,"" she said.
This year Ashoka Arab World launched a Young Changemakers
scheme with the British Council and social enterprise Red Ochre
to help support females aged 16-20 from rural Egypt develop
social enterprise ideas.
Egypt rose to 22nd place from 29th three years ago when
asked if women were well represented in social enterprises.
South Africa was in 23rd place, also up from 29th.
""The reason why young people are excited is it gives them an
opportunity to be leaders, it gives them an opportunity to be of
help to others and recognition, and this is something that young
people did not have before,"" said Bibars.
""Since there are so many social problems in the country and
poverty, there is a lot of space for them to innovate.""

              <p>NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -
O pportunities to build businesses with a mission to do good in
the United States have plummeted since 2016 due largely to a
decline in government support, according to the second global
poll on the best countries for social entrepreneurs on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The United States fell the most out of 45 countries in the
Thomson Reuters Foundation survey of about 900 social enterprise
experts, diving to 32nd place from the top ranking in the
inaugural survey three years ago.</p>
              <p>The poll found the United States fell the most of all
nations when respondents were asked if government policy
supported social entrepreneurs, and came last in a combined
ranking about women's leading role in running such businesses.</p>
              <p>It also suffered the biggest drop of all countries when
asked if social entrepreneurs could access investment,
plummeting 38 places to be ranked third last.</p>
              <p>Richard Parker, a professor of economics and expert in
social entrepreneurship at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government, said while any number of factors could be
responsible, the nation's political climate stands out.</p>
              <p>He said the ""shock of the Trump administration"" had rattled
the view that small and mid-sized businesses can do good and
tackle social problems.</p>
              <p>""For lots of liberals who are going to be associated with
social entrepreneurship, the sense is that the sky is falling,""
Parker told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p>""It's not a time to talk about the green shoots when the sky
is falling.""</p>
              <p>A social entrepreneur is typically someone who uses
commercial strategies to tackle social and environmental
problems, combining social good and financial gain.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>TRADE TENSIONS</p>
              <p>The United States was previously cited as a leader for
promoting social enterprise, with President Barack Obama setting
up a global entrepreneurship summit and bringing in a law
allowing crowdfunding used by small investors with social aims.</p>
              <p>But Obama also promoted social entrepreneurship as a form of
foreign policy and that did not extend into the Trump
administration, said Jennifer Kushell, founder of EYP Ventures
that creates online learning programs about youth employment.</p>
              <p>""The funding dried up, the focus on international dried up,""
she said. ""We lost a lot of momentum.""</p>
              <p>When Donald Trump took office in 2017, a list of social
entrepreneurs opposed a travel ban that blocked people from
seven majority-Muslim nations - Iran, Chad, Libya, North Korea,
Somalia, Syria and Yemen - from entering the United States.</p>
              <p>The ban ""will make our work to foster peace, sustainability,
opportunity and inclusiveness much harder ... giving our
organizations still more challenges to overcome,"" the social
entrepreneurs wrote in a public letter.</p>
              <p>Trump's administration also moved to undo a program - the
International Entrepreneur Rule - designed to encourage
entrepreneurs to move to the United States to start businesses.</p>
              <p>Immigrants are nearly twice as likely to start businesses as
native-born Americans, according the Kauffman Foundation, a
non-profit focused on education and entrepreneurship.</p>
              <p>Trump's decision to cut cash to the U.N.-backed Green
Climate Fund and pull out of the Paris climate agreement have
also been widely criticized and seen as withdrawing support for
businesses focusing on clean energy and zero carbon.</p>
              <p>Representatives at the U.S. Department of Commerce, which
oversees entrepreneurial programs, did not respond to requests
for comment on the Thomson Reuters Foundation's poll findings.</p>
              <p>But the department pointed to a program giving grants
totalling $23 million to several dozen groups to boost
entrepreneurship and increase access to capital.</p>
              <p>The United States fell the most of all nations surveyed when
respondents were asked if conditions were favorable for social

NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -
O pportunities to build businesses with a mission to do good in
the United States have plummeted since 2016 due largely to a
decline in government support, according to the second global
poll on the best countries for social entrepreneurs on Tuesday.
The United States fell the most out of 45 countries in the
Thomson Reuters Foundation survey of about 900 social enterprise
experts, diving to 32nd place from the top ranking in the
inaugural survey three years ago.
The poll found the United States fell the most of all
nations when respondents were asked if government policy
supported social entrepreneurs, and came last in a combined
ranking about women's leading role in running such businesses.
It also suffered the biggest drop of all countries when
asked if social entrepreneurs could access investment,
plummeting 38 places to be ranked third last.
Richard Parker, a professor of economics and expert in
social entrepreneurship at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government, said while any number of factors could be
responsible, the nation's political climate stands out.
He said the ""shock of the Trump administration"" had rattled
the view that small and mid-sized businesses can do good and
tackle social problems.
""For lots of liberals who are going to be associated with
social entrepreneurship, the sense is that the sky is falling,""
Parker told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
""It's not a time to talk about the green shoots when the sky
is falling.""
A social entrepreneur is typically someone who uses
commercial strategies to tackle social and environmental
problems, combining social good and financial gain.

TRADE TENSIONS
The United States was previously cited as a leader for
promoting social enterprise, with President Barack Obama setting
up a global entrepreneurship summit and bringing in a law
allowing crowdfunding used by small investors with social aims.
But Obama also promoted social entrepreneurship as a form of
foreign policy and that did not extend into the Trump
administration, said Jennifer Kushell, founder of EYP Ventures
that creates online learning programs about youth employment.
""The funding dried up, the focus on international dried up,""
she said. ""We lost a lot of momentum.""
When Donald Trump took office in 2017, a list of social
entrepreneurs opposed a travel ban that blocked people from
seven majority-Muslim nations - Iran, Chad, Libya, North Korea,
Somalia, Syria and Yemen - from entering the United States.
The ban ""will make our work to foster peace, sustainability,
opportunity and inclusiveness much harder ... giving our
organizations still more challenges to overcome,"" the social
entrepreneurs wrote in a public letter.
Trump's administration also moved to undo a program - the
International Entrepreneur Rule - designed to encourage
entrepreneurs to move to the United States to start businesses.
Immigrants are nearly twice as likely to start businesses as
native-born Americans, according the Kauffman Foundation, a
non-profit focused on education and entrepreneurship.
Trump's decision to cut cash to the U.N.-backed Green
Climate Fund and pull out of the Paris climate agreement have
also been widely criticized and seen as withdrawing support for
businesses focusing on clean energy and zero carbon.
Representatives at the U.S. Department of Commerce, which
oversees entrepreneurial programs, did not respond to requests
for comment on the Thomson Reuters Foundation's poll findings.
But the department pointed to a program giving grants
totalling $23 million to several dozen groups to boost
entrepreneurship and increase access to capital.
The United States fell the most of all nations surveyed when
respondents were asked if conditions were favorable for social
entrepreneurs, dropping to 22nd place from top slot in 2016.
They reported it had become more difficult to sell to
governments and to businesses.
Parker said brewing trade tensions between the United States
and China have also created uncertainty.
The United States and China, the world's top two economies,
have been in a 15-month trade war that the IMF said is partly to
blame for a sharp slowdown in global growth.
""A lot of people are going to the sidelines,"" said Parker.
""They just aren't sure where this is all going to end up.""
But the United States came in fifth place for seeing more
young people getting involved in the sector.
""If you can get into the right room and capture the right
attention and have the right people advocating for you, the
possibilities are endless,"" said Thomas Brennan, who launched
The War Horse in 2016, a non-profit newsroom focused on the
human impact of war.
But he said: ""People are becoming a lot more risk averse.
""There's so much vitriol that's floating in the air. That
has a direct impact on who and how much of a commitment a person
might be willing to make.""
The poll of social entrepreneurs, academics, investors and
support agencies, supported by Deutsche Bank, found Canada was
the best country for business leaders seeking to tackle social
problems, then Australia and France.

              <p>MEDELLIN, Colombia, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -
G rowing up in a gang-ridden hillside slum in Colombia's second
city of Medellin, Bryan Estiven Carmona knew becoming a street
drug dealer was far more likely than getting a decent job.</p>
              <p>""The idea of earning a quick, easy buck by working for the
gangs is a common problem where I live. The temptation is always
there,"" said 21-year-old Carmona.</p>
              <p>Yet against the odds, Carmona landed a job last year as a
software tester with the Medellin office of Arbusta, an
Argentine tech company that does social good.</p>
              <p>He is one of about 30 young men and women hired by Arbusta,
which aims to give jobs to unemployed people from poor
backgrounds, with no work experience or university education.</p>
              <p>Arbusta and 80 other companies, including local and foreign
social enterprises, have set up shop at Ruta N, a
government-funded innovation center in the city of 2.5 million
people once known as the world's murder capital.</p>
              <p>Since then Ruta N has emerged as a leading hub for social
entrepreneurship in Latin America, making the city one of
world's hot spots for social entrepreneurs according to a
Thomson Reuters Foundation poll on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>""Here there's significant political will to drive social
innovation and entrepreneurship,"" said Maria Ines Londono,
Arbusta country manager. ""Ruta N is an oasis in the midst of
difficult neighborhoods.""</p>
              <p>The Thomson Reuters Foundation's second global poll of
experts on the best countries for social entrepreneurs,
supported by Deutsche Bank, found Medellin among the top four
city hot spots for business leaders seeking to do good.</p>
              <p>The three others were Berlin, London, and Santiago.</p>
              <p>In the inaugural poll in 2016, experts named Berlin, London,
Hong Kong, and Santiago as the global city hot spots.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>VIOLENT HISTORY</p>
              <p>It is a big turnaround for Medellin, the epicenter of
Colombia's drug wars of the 1980s.</p>
              <p>""We've had to become resilient and work together to move the
city forward, which creates a conducive environment for
entrepreneurship,"" said Alejandro Franco, head of Ruta N,
sitting in a co-working place in the building.</p>
              <p>Scattered across a warren of slum areas are numerous
examples of Medellin's social innovation, driven by consecutive
mayors over the past two decades and funded by city hall.</p>
              <p>New schools, public libraries, open-air gyms and landscaped
parks have been built in once once-neglected, no-go slum areas.</p>

MEDELLIN, Colombia, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -
G rowing up in a gang-ridden hillside slum in Colombia's second
city of Medellin, Bryan Estiven Carmona knew becoming a street
drug dealer was far more likely than getting a decent job.
""The idea of earning a quick, easy buck by working for the
gangs is a common problem where I live. The temptation is always
there,"" said 21-year-old Carmona.
Yet against the odds, Carmona landed a job last year as a
software tester with the Medellin office of Arbusta, an
Argentine tech company that does social good.
He is one of about 30 young men and women hired by Arbusta,
which aims to give jobs to unemployed people from poor
backgrounds, with no work experience or university education.
Arbusta and 80 other companies, including local and foreign
social enterprises, have set up shop at Ruta N, a
government-funded innovation center in the city of 2.5 million
people once known as the world's murder capital.
Since then Ruta N has emerged as a leading hub for social
entrepreneurship in Latin America, making the city one of
world's hot spots for social entrepreneurs according to a
Thomson Reuters Foundation poll on Tuesday.
""Here there's significant political will to drive social
innovation and entrepreneurship,"" said Maria Ines Londono,
Arbusta country manager. ""Ruta N is an oasis in the midst of
difficult neighborhoods.""
The Thomson Reuters Foundation's second global poll of
experts on the best countries for social entrepreneurs,
supported by Deutsche Bank, found Medellin among the top four
city hot spots for business leaders seeking to do good.
The three others were Berlin, London, and Santiago.
In the inaugural poll in 2016, experts named Berlin, London,
Hong Kong, and Santiago as the global city hot spots.

VIOLENT HISTORY
It is a big turnaround for Medellin, the epicenter of
Colombia's drug wars of the 1980s.
""We've had to become resilient and work together to move the
city forward, which creates a conducive environment for
entrepreneurship,"" said Alejandro Franco, head of Ruta N,
sitting in a co-working place in the building.
Scattered across a warren of slum areas are numerous
examples of Medellin's social innovation, driven by consecutive
mayors over the past two decades and funded by city hall.
New schools, public libraries, open-air gyms and landscaped
parks have been built in once once-neglected, no-go slum areas.
Medellin's much copied cable car transport system ferries
residents up and down hillsides, connecting slum dwellers with
the rest of the city in a quick and affordable way.
Social entrepreneur Matt Alexander said Medellin's tradition
of innovation and entrepreneurship were key reasons for locating
his U.S. company's international headquarters there.
""We wanted to be in an environment where public officials
and others were accustomed to pushing the envelope in terms of
thinking of new solutions for old problems,"" said the co-founder
of Suyo, which uses technology to help poor families formalize
their land and property titles.
Ruta N has supported dozens of social and tech businesses
over the past decade by offering free mentoring opportunities
and workshops on finance and technology, and help with access to
funding and low-interest loans.
""Ruta N is a hub that allows you to connect. It helps being
under one roof,"" said Andres Castellon, finance director at
likeU, a Colombian outsourcing and call center business that
employs women and single mothers from poor neighborhoods.
While Medellin fared well in the poll as a hot spot,
Colombia's overall ranking in the list of best countries for
social entrepreneurs dropped 25 places from three years ago to
39 out of 43 countries.
In Colombia, social enterprise is a relatively new concept,
emerging about five years ago. Experts said many businesses had
set up in an informal way without government support.
Colombia does not define social enterprises by law as
businesses with specific legal and tax treatment.
Paula Zapata, who heads the Medellin mayor's office for
economic development, said the city's violent past had led to a
tradition of the public sector, mayor, business leaders and
universities coming together to solve social problems.
This has forged an environment where social entrepreneurs
can build partnerships with local government and academia.
""In the midst of adversity is when creativity emerges, it is
when social innovation is born,"" Zapata said.

              <p>LONDON, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Whether it is

              <p>As social entrepreneurship gains traction around the world,

              <p>Here are six frequently asked questions about the sector:</p>
              <p>1. What is a social entrepreneur?</p>
              <p>There is no universally accepted definition, but broadly a

to sustain their venture and its impact.</p>
              <p>2. Do they run businesses or charities?</p>
              <p>Social entrepreneurs can structure their organisations as
non-profit or for profit. Typically any profits generated from
the business are reinvested to advance their stated social cause

              <p>Bill Drayton is said to have coined the phrase in the 1980s

              <p>4. Do governments support social entrepreneurs?</p>
              <p>More nations are considering laws to promote social

registered social enterprises, who commit to reinvesting 70% of
their profits, while Ireland published its first social

              <p>By Sarah  Shearman</p>
              <p>LONDON, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Canada was
named the best country for business leaders seeking to tackle
social problems in a global poll on Tuesday while the United
States fell from top slot due to political uncertainty.</p>
              <p>Australia came second in the Thomson Reuters Foundation's
second global survey on the best countries for social
entrepreneurs, seeing the biggest gain of 24 places from the
inaugural poll in 2016, while France came third.</p>
              <p>Mexico came last, down 15 places from 2016, but the United
States was the biggest loser, plunging to 32nd place from No. 1,
with the poll of about 900 social enterprise experts pointing to
difficulties with government policy and access to investment.</p>
              <p>Francois Bonnici, head of the Schwab Foundation for Social
Entrepreneurship, said over the past three years there had been
""some amazing gains and some ongoing challenges"" for social
entrepreneurs addressing issues from climate change to refugees.</p>
              <p>""Governments are recognising that to meet their own agendas
this is a group of citizens and entrepreneurs that actually want
to improve society and the environment,"" said Bonnici.</p>
              <p>""But it has a slightly different flavour in each country
and that government role is important (as it) can legitimise the
sector in their country by creating these policies.""</p>
              <p>Business entrepreneurs globally are increasingly setting
their sights on social problems with ventures that can be a
commercial success while addressing problems like unemployment,
homelessness, mental health, knife crime and even loneliness.</p>
              <p>For example in South Africa social enterprise Harambee has
created a 'dating service' to match unemployed youth with
employers, while in India Project Patradya is tackling the waste
problem by employing Afghan refugee women to make edible bowls.</p>
              <p>But with little data on which nations were encouraging the
sector, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, in partnership with
Deutsche Bank, began a poll in 2016 which was repeated in 2019.
Social entrepreneurs, academics, investors and support
agencies in the world's 45 biggest economies, as ranked by the
World Bank, were asked their views. Iran and Saudi Arabia were
dropped in 2019 as it was impossible to get the right sample.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>LACK OF UNDERSTANDING</p>
              <p>The 2019 poll found most experts, 82%, said social
entrepreneurship was gaining momentum in their countries -
although this was down three percentage points from 2016.</p>
              <p>Canada, Indonesia and South Africa were named as the top
countries where social entrepreneurship was gaining momentum,
while Mexico, the United States and China saw the biggest falls.</p>
              <p>Despite this, more than half of respondents - 54% - said the
public still did not understand what they did which was not
helped by the lack of a global definition of social enterprise.
Italians were most aware of their work and Poles the least.</p>
              <p>""People are becoming aware that the whole notion of social
entrepreneurship is not just kumbaya,"" said former
Bangladeshi-U.S. investment banker Durreen Shahnaz, founder of
the first social stock exchange, Impact Investment Exchange
(IIX).</p>
              <p>""It really is about doing serious work and making sure that
work is scalable ... There are signs the industry is maturing.""</p>
              <p>The rising interest of young people - under the age of 25 -
was a new finding, with three in four experts saying more young
people were interested in working in social enterprises.</p>
              <p>Indonesian social entrepreneur Denica Flesch wanted a career
where she had a direct impact in the fight against poverty so in
2016, aged 26, she founded SukkhaCitta, an online marketplace
selling clothes made by female artisans in Indonesian villages.
""Young people are really challenging the notion of work, and
combining purpose and career in one place,"" said Flesch.</p>
              <p>""They're more idealistic and want to do something that's
beyond just looking for money.""</p>
              <p>Canada was named as the top country where young people were
playing a leading role as social entrepreneurs, followed by
Germany and France, as well as the top place for women leaders.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>WOMEN TAKING A LEAD</p>
              <p>""Culturally we are about diversity and inclusion at a
national level. That's our brand, so that is helpful for the
environment for social enterprise,"" said Marcia Nozick, founder
and chief executive of Vancouver-based social enterprise EMBERS.</p>

* United States suffers biggest fall amid political
uncertainty
* More youth interest in working for businesses that do good
By Sarah  Shearman
LONDON, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Canada was
named the best country for business leaders seeking to tackle
social problems in a global poll on Tuesday while the United
States fell from top slot due to political uncertainty.
Australia came second in the Thomson Reuters Foundation's
second global survey on the best countries for social
entrepreneurs, seeing the biggest gain of 24 places from the
inaugural poll in 2016, while France came third.
Mexico came last, down 15 places from 2016, but the United
States was the biggest loser, plunging to 32nd place from No. 1,
with the poll of about 900 social enterprise experts pointing to
difficulties with government policy and access to investment.
Francois Bonnici, head of the Schwab Foundation for Social
Entrepreneurship, said over the past three years there had been
""some amazing gains and some ongoing challenges"" for social
entrepreneurs addressing issues from climate change to refugees.
""Governments are recognising that to meet their own agendas
this is a group of citizens and entrepreneurs that actually want
to improve society and the environment,"" said Bonnici.
""But it has a slightly different flavour in each country
and that government role is important (as it) can legitimise the
sector in their country by creating these policies.""
Business entrepreneurs globally are increasingly setting
their sights on social problems with ventures that can be a
commercial success while addressing problems like unemployment,
homelessness, mental health, knife crime and even loneliness.
For example in South Africa social enterprise Harambee has
created a 'dating service' to match unemployed youth with
employers, while in India Project Patradya is tackling the waste
problem by employing Afghan refugee women to make edible bowls.
But with little data on which nations were encouraging the
sector, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, in partnership with
Deutsche Bank, began a poll in 2016 which was repeated in 2019.
Social entrepreneurs, academics, investors and support
agencies in the world's 45 biggest economies, as ranked by the
World Bank, were asked their views. Iran and Saudi Arabia were
dropped in 2019 as it was impossible to get the right sample.

LACK OF UNDERSTANDING
The 2019 poll found most experts, 82%, said social
entrepreneurship was gaining momentum in their countries -
although this was down three percentage points from 2016.
Canada, Indonesia and South Africa were named as the top
countries where social entrepreneurship was gaining momentum,
while Mexico, the United States and China saw the biggest falls.
Despite this, more than half of respondents - 54% - said the
public still did not understand what they did which was not
helped by the lack of a global definition of social enterprise.
Italians were most aware of their work and Poles the least.
""People are becoming aware that the whole notion of social
entrepreneurship is not just kumbaya,"" said former
Bangladeshi-U.S. investment banker Durreen Shahnaz, founder of
the first social stock exchange, Impact Investment Exchange
(IIX).
""It really is about doing serious work and making sure that
work is scalable ... There are signs the industry is maturing.""
The rising interest of young people - under the age of 25 -
was a new finding, with three in four experts saying more young
people were interested in working in social enterprises.
Indonesian social entrepreneur Denica Flesch wanted a career
where she had a direct impact in the fight against poverty so in
2016, aged 26, she founded SukkhaCitta, an online marketplace
selling clothes made by female artisans in Indonesian villages.
""Young people are really challenging the notion of work, and
combining purpose and career in one place,"" said Flesch.
""They're more idealistic and want to do something that's
beyond just looking for money.""
Canada was named as the top country where young people were
playing a leading role as social entrepreneurs, followed by
Germany and France, as well as the top place for women leaders.

WOMEN TAKING A LEAD
""Culturally we are about diversity and inclusion at a
national level. That's our brand, so that is helpful for the
environment for social enterprise,"" said Marcia Nozick, founder
and chief executive of Vancouver-based social enterprise EMBERS.
She said policies that encouraged governments to buy the
services of social impact ventures had been vital in helping the
growth of EMBERS, which finds flexible jobs for people in a
deprived part of Vancouver.
Nozick said there were many female leaders because it was
""about caring and relationships and that has always been at the
forefront of what women have brought to the business sector"".
Women were also seen as playing a leading role as social
entrepreneurs in Australia, Belgium, Sweden and Malaysia.
The United States was named the worst place for female
social entrepreneurs - the same as in 2016 - while Argentina and
China slumped the most in questions regarding women in the poll
conducted online and by telephone between May 7 and July 30.
The biggest falls for the United States overall related to
access to investment, selling to businesses and supportive
government policy.
Attracting investment continued to be a challenge, according
to 56% of experts, down two percentage points from 2016.
Bonnie Chiu, founder and chief executive of Lensational, a
social enterprise that trains marginalised women as
photographers, said there was more capital available to social
entrepreneurs but they had to jump through hoops to get it.
""So much time is spent chasing these opportunities,"" said
Chiu, whose business is based in Britain and Hong Kong.
""Traditional businesses just need to prove that they are
financially sound, traditional charities just need to prove that
they are generating social impact - but social enterprises need
to do both.""
But regardless of the problems getting political support,
financing or selling to businesses, experts said there would
always be a need for social entrepreneurs to address the world's
largest problems where markets or public policy had failed.
""The more our political leaders might struggle to solve the

              <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The
potential for a global tree-planting drive to curb
climate-change risks has been overestimated, scientists warned,
flagging issues with maps and data used in a recent study and
urging greater efforts to cut heat-trapping emissions by other
means.</p>
              <p>In July, researchers at the Crowther Lab, based at Swiss
university ETH Zurich, published a study suggesting the best way
to keep climate change in check would be to replant trees on
destroyed forest areas the size of the United States.</p>
              <p>But in a response letter published in the same journal
Science on Friday, scientists at the University of Bonn and
Nairobi-based research centre World Agroforestry said there were
limits on the number of trees that could be grown on lands
included in the initial study.</p>
              <p>Eike Luedeling, a professor at the University of Bonn's
Institute of Crop Sciences and Resource Conservation, told the
Thomson Reuters Foundation that reforestation should not be seen
as a substitute for curbing emissions from using fossil fuels.</p>
              <p>""Yes, we can all plant trees... and if we still keep
emitting carbon dioxide like crazy, we will not have solved
anything - we just bought a little bit of time,"" he said.</p>
              <p>""If we want to control climate change, there is really only
one answer... we have to cut emissions,"" he added by phone.</p>
              <p>Environmentalists say protecting existing forests and
restoring damaged ones prevents flooding, stores planet-warming
carbon, limits climate change and protects
biodiversity.</p>
              <p>But the tropics lost 12 million hectares of tree cover in
2018, the fourth-highest annual loss since records began in
2001, according to monitoring service Global Forest Watch.</p>
              <p>Of greatest concern, it said, was the disappearance of 3.6
million hectares of old-growth rainforest, an area the size of
Belgium, much due to fires, land-clearing for farms and mining.</p>
              <p>Crowther Lab scientists this year published what they said

              <p>The study analysed the maximum amount of carbon that could
be captured if all available degraded forest areas not used by
humans were replanted and allowed to mature.</p>
              <p>But researchers at the University of Bonn and World
Agroforestry questioned its findings in their letter.</p>
              <p>The Crowther Lab's classification of many ""high-potential""

              <p>In addition, soils in many deforested areas are eroded or

and data on uninhabited areas were not accurate.</p>

farming, as potential reforestation areas, it added.</p>
              <p>Villages, smaller settlements and even some large cities,

were also counted as potential sites for tree planting.</p>
              <p>""Around 2.5 billion people live in the areas that the study

              <p>Luedeling and his colleagues nonetheless welcomed the idea

benefits to ecosystems.</p>
              <p>""Reforestation buys us time that we urgently need,"" said
Luedeling. ""But it can only be one building block in a

              <p>SEOUL (Reuters) - A commercial by Japanese clothing brand Uniqlo has stirred a consumer backlash in South Korea amid accusations that it mocks victims of wartime forced labour and brothel workers, reopening deep wounds from Japan's colonial past.</p>
              <p>A YouTube video created by a South Korean student parodying the ad has gone viral and protesters have targeted Uniqlo stores, demanding an apology from the company.</p>
              <p>In the Uniqlo commercial, Iris Apfel, a 97-year-old American style icon with more than 1.4 million Instagram followers, is in an animated conversation with 12-year-old fashion designer Kheris Rogers.</p>
              <p>When Rogers asks how she used to dress as a teenager, Apfel says: ""I can't remember that far back!""</p>
              <p>Instead of a literal translation of that line, the commercial that aired in South Korea carried subtitles saying: ""Gosh! How can I remember something that goes back 80 years?""</p>
              <p>Gaining more than 101,000 views in two days, the 19-second parody video posted on Saturday depicts a likeness of the Uniqlo TV commercial, which the company began airing this month in South Korea and other markets.</p>
              <p>In the parody, South Korean college student Youn Dong-hyeun stands with Yang Geum-deok, a 90-year-old woman who had been a forced labourer for Japan's Mitsubishi during World War Two.</p>
              <p>Youn, a history major, asks how hard it was for Yang when she was young. ""It is impossible to ever forget that awfully painful memory,"" she replies. Youn has posted the video with subtitles in English and Japanese.</p>
              <p>Uniqlo, owned by Japan's Fast Retailing Co Ltd, pulled the ad in South Korea on Saturday.</p>
              <p>""There was no intention to touch on the issue of comfort women or the South Korea-Japan dispute,"" a Uniqlo official in Seoul told Reuters, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation.</p>
              <p>""Comfort women"" is a euphemism for girls and women, many of them Korean, who were forced to work in Japan's wartime brothels. </p>
              <p>Relations between the two countries are at their poorest in decades after a ruling by South Korea's top court last year ordering Japan's Nippon Steel &amp; Sumitomo Metal Corp and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to compensate wartime forced labourers.</p>
              <p>In July, Japan tightened controls on exports of three key high-tech materials to South Korea. Seoul accused Tokyo of taking the step in retaliation to the court ruling, prompting a wide-ranging boycott of Japanese products.</p>
              <p/>

SEOUL (Reuters) - A commercial by Japanese clothing brand Uniqlo has stirred a consumer backlash in South Korea amid accusations that it mocks victims of wartime forced labour and brothel workers, reopening deep wounds from Japan's colonial past.
A YouTube video created by a South Korean student parodying the ad has gone viral and protesters have targeted Uniqlo stores, demanding an apology from the company.
In the Uniqlo commercial, Iris Apfel, a 97-year-old American style icon with more than 1.4 million Instagram followers, is in an animated conversation with 12-year-old fashion designer Kheris Rogers.
When Rogers asks how she used to dress as a teenager, Apfel says: ""I can't remember that far back!""
Instead of a literal translation of that line, the commercial that aired in South Korea carried subtitles saying: ""Gosh! How can I remember something that goes back 80 years?""
Gaining more than 101,000 views in two days, the 19-second parody video posted on Saturday depicts a likeness of the Uniqlo TV commercial, which the company began airing this month in South Korea and other markets.
In the parody, South Korean college student Youn Dong-hyeun stands with Yang Geum-deok, a 90-year-old woman who had been a forced labourer for Japan's Mitsubishi during World War Two.
Youn, a history major, asks how hard it was for Yang when she was young. ""It is impossible to ever forget that awfully painful memory,"" she replies. Youn has posted the video with subtitles in English and Japanese.
Uniqlo, owned by Japan's Fast Retailing Co Ltd, pulled the ad in South Korea on Saturday.
""There was no intention to touch on the issue of comfort women or the South Korea-Japan dispute,"" a Uniqlo official in Seoul told Reuters, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation.
""Comfort women"" is a euphemism for girls and women, many of them Korean, who were forced to work in Japan's wartime brothels. 
Relations between the two countries are at their poorest in decades after a ruling by South Korea's top court last year ordering Japan's Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to compensate wartime forced labourers.
In July, Japan tightened controls on exports of three key high-tech materials to South Korea. Seoul accused Tokyo of taking the step in retaliation to the court ruling, prompting a wide-ranging boycott of Japanese products.

""WE REMEMBER""
South Korea and Japan share a bitter history dating to the Japanese colonisation of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945, including the use of comfort women.
South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon travelled to Japan on Tuesday to attend Emperor Naruhito's enthronement ceremony on behalf of President Moon Jae-in. 
Lee's office said he planned to meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday, which would be the highest-level contact between the two countries since July's export curbs.
Uniqlo has already seen its South Korean sales hit and a sharp drop in customers at its stores as part of the boycott.
The translation for the ad's subtitles, which was carried out in South Korea, was meant to help convey the message of the original commercial, the official said. She declined to identify who had performed the translation.
Student protesters took to the streets as the outcry against the commercial grew, demanding an official apology from Uniqlo. 
Bang Seulkichan, 22, was among those picketing a Uniqlo store in Seoul, holding a sign that read: “Colonial rule 80 years ago – we remember!” 
Park Young-sun, South Korea's minister for small and medium enterprises, told a parliament committee on Monday the ad controversy was ""very upsetting"".

              <p>PENANG, Malaysia, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -
I nnovations such as roads that reflect heat and water-absorbing
pavements that will help the Olympic Games in Tokyo be a carbon
neutral event, could also be adopted by other cities looking to
mitigate climate risks, urban experts said.</p>
              <p>Tools set for the 2020 Games include uniforms made from
recycled plastic and cool zones for pedestrians to escape hot
weather, can become regular features in Japanese cities and
elsewhere, said an official at the Tokyo environment bureau.</p>
              <p>""The Olympics are a big event, so it is a good opportunity
to get our citizens involved in addressing the issues of climate
change and sustainability,"" deputy director Kumiko Sugawara said
at the sidelines of a United Nations urban forum in Penang.</p>
              <p>""Tokyo is facing more climate risks like hotter weather and
more frequent typhoons. By getting the public involved in
meeting the goal of being a zero-carbon city, we hope efforts
will continue even after the Games,"" she said on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Earlier this month, several matches in the Rugby World Cup
in Japan were called off for the first time in the tournament's
32-year history because of Typhoon Hagibis.</p>
              <p>The International Olympic Committee's (IOC) sustainability

seeks to maximise the use of existing facilities, ensure new
constructions benefit local communities, and limit the event's
greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
              <p>Organisers of the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games aim to
offset all carbon emissions generated, said Junichi Fujino, an
environmental researcher on the city's taskforce.</p>
              <p>Few new facilities are being built, with the main stadium
where the opening and closing ceremonies will be held made from
sustainably sourced timber, he said, and wood used for some
venues to be re-used in public benches and buildings.</p>
              <p>All medals will be made from metal extracted from recycled
consumer electronics, including about 6.2 million used mobile
phones. The Olympic torch is made from aluminium waste, and the

PENANG, Malaysia, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -
I nnovations such as roads that reflect heat and water-absorbing
pavements that will help the Olympic Games in Tokyo be a carbon
neutral event, could also be adopted by other cities looking to
mitigate climate risks, urban experts said.
Tools set for the 2020 Games include uniforms made from
recycled plastic and cool zones for pedestrians to escape hot
weather, can become regular features in Japanese cities and
elsewhere, said an official at the Tokyo environment bureau.
""The Olympics are a big event, so it is a good opportunity
to get our citizens involved in addressing the issues of climate
change and sustainability,"" deputy director Kumiko Sugawara said
at the sidelines of a United Nations urban forum in Penang.
""Tokyo is facing more climate risks like hotter weather and
more frequent typhoons. By getting the public involved in
meeting the goal of being a zero-carbon city, we hope efforts
will continue even after the Games,"" she said on Tuesday.
Earlier this month, several matches in the Rugby World Cup
in Japan were called off for the first time in the tournament's
32-year history because of Typhoon Hagibis.
The International Olympic Committee's (IOC) sustainability
strategy http://extrassets.olympic.org/sustainability-strategy/executivesummary/#_ga=2.216704209.636196531.1571722528-12757604.1571224674
seeks to maximise the use of existing facilities, ensure new
constructions benefit local communities, and limit the event's
greenhouse gas emissions.
Organisers of the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games aim to
offset all carbon emissions generated, said Junichi Fujino, an
environmental researcher on the city's taskforce.
Few new facilities are being built, with the main stadium
where the opening and closing ceremonies will be held made from
sustainably sourced timber, he said, and wood used for some
venues to be re-used in public benches and buildings.
All medals will be made from metal extracted from recycled
consumer electronics, including about 6.2 million used mobile
phones. The Olympic torch is made from aluminium waste, and the
podiums from recycled household and marine plastic waste.
Electricity for the Games will come from renewable sources.
The challenge is also to limit the impact of high humidity
and temperatures that commonly exceed 30 degrees Celsius (86F)
in July and August, Fujino told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
""Hotter summers are a challenge, and the Games are in the
summer. So we are taking all measures possible to reduce the
impact on athletes and visitors,"" he said.
These include asking companies and the public to cover

              <p>BARCELONA, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -
Governments, development banks and businesses are providing less
than 1% of the money needed each year to wean 3 billion people
off dirty, health-harming cooking by an international deadline
of 2030, new data on energy access showed on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>In 2017, the latest figures available, funding commitments
for clean cooking in 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia
with the largest needs plummeted by 73%, to $32 million, from
the average in the previous two years, found a report tracking
finance towards global goals on energy.</p>
              <p>An annual investment of $4.4 billion is required to move to
modern cooking methods the nearly 40% of the world's people who
still use traditional fuels such as wood, charcoal, dung or
kerosene, often in smoky indoor environments, researchers said.</p>
              <p>The World Health Organization estimates that household air
pollution kills about 4 million people each year, many of them
women and children, through ailments such as heart and lung
disease and cancer.</p>
              <p>Olivia Coldrey, lead finance specialist with Sustainable
Energy for All, a U.N.-linked body that co-produced the report,
highlighted a ""continued lack of global effort"" to tackle low
access to less-polluting fuels and more efficient stoves.</p>
              <p>""This is really an environmental and public health
emergency,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, noting that
investment in cleaner cooking was ""orders of magnitude away from
what it needs to be"".</p>
              <p>International donor projects to boost clean cooking were
fragmented, often short-term and tended to focus on single
countries and technologies, she added.</p>
              <p>Barbara Buchner, executive director of climate finance at
the Climate Policy Initiative, a think tank that partnered on
the annual report, called for ""a paradigm shift"" in thinking, to
focus on ensuring new fuel supplies as well as cleaner stoves.</p>
              <p>Governments need to set stronger targets, and allocate large
budgets to help poor households afford the upfront costs of
moving to improved cooking methods, she added.</p>
              <p>Riccardo Puliti, global director for energy and extractive
industries at the World Bank, said clean cooking should be ""a
political, economic and environmental priority"" because, without
urgent action, other global goals on health, gender and climate
change would be missed.</p>
              <p>Last month, at a U.N. climate summit, the bank unveiled
plans for a $500-million ""Clean Cooking Fund"", supported by the
Netherlands, Norway, Denmark and Britain. It aims to increase
investment and back businesses delivering solutions.</p>
              <p>The report said more efficient stoves that use wood and
other biomass received the greatest amount of finance in 2017.</p>
              <p>Private-sector finance for clean cooking showed ""green
shoots"", with investment rising to about $21 million in 2017 and
accounting for two-thirds of all funding.
Kenya grabbed the lion's share, at more than 60%, of all
commitments for clean cooking that year.</p>
              <p>The report noted that, due to the difficulty of monitoring
domestic public spending, its analysis likely under-represented
financing in some developing states that have prioritised clean
cooking, such as India and Indonesia.</p>
              <p>Coldrey and Buchner urged development banks to work on
strategies for large-scale programmes needed to close the clean
cooking gap.</p>
              <p>That will require a different type of support from
traditional backing for big energy infrastructure projects, they
noted.</p>
              <p>A similar push is needed to ramp up backing for off-grid
renewable power and mini-grid systems that target the poorest
among the 840 million people still living without electricity,
they added.</p>
              <p>The data for 2017 showed that investment in these solutions
was still a tiny proportion - just 1.2% - of total finance for
electricity access and stood at $430 million in 2017, with
Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda garnering 56% of that.</p>
              <p>While innovative models for providing off-grid power have
proliferated, they are not yet being implemented widely enough
as the market is still learning what works, said Buchner.</p>
              <p>The World Bank's Puliti said its off-grid portfolio was
growing rapidly, with the bank putting $600 million into
mini-grids and solar home systems in the 2018 fiscal year.</p>
              <p>It supports the largest off-grid programme in the world in
Bangladesh, he noted, powering 2.5 million households through
1.2 million solar home systems, as well as solar irrigation
pumps and mini-grids, and 1.4 million efficient cookstoves.</p>
              <p>Overall, finance to boost electricity access in the 20
countries where nearly four-fifths of those who lack a modern
energy supply live increased to $36 billion in 2017, after
stagnating at $30 billion in 2015 and 2016.</p>
              <p>But only an estimated one-third of that spending went to
provide electric power in homes.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>'UNACCEPTABLE' COAL</p>
              <p>Some of the funding to boost electricity access paid for
grid-connected fossil fuel plants, mostly coal-powered, although
such funding dropped by about a fifth from the two previous
years, to $6.6 billion in 2017.</p>
              <p>The money financed four coal plants in Bangladesh and the
Philippines, with 60% of all coal money that year coming from
the export-import banks of India and China, the report said.</p>
              <p>Given scientific evidence that carbon emissions must be cut
further and faster to curb the accelerating impacts of climate

BARCELONA, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -
Governments, development banks and businesses are providing less
than 1% of the money needed each year to wean 3 billion people
off dirty, health-harming cooking by an international deadline
of 2030, new data on energy access showed on Tuesday.
In 2017, the latest figures available, funding commitments
for clean cooking in 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia
with the largest needs plummeted by 73%, to $32 million, from
the average in the previous two years, found a report tracking
finance towards global goals on energy.
An annual investment of $4.4 billion is required to move to
modern cooking methods the nearly 40% of the world's people who
still use traditional fuels such as wood, charcoal, dung or
kerosene, often in smoky indoor environments, researchers said.
The World Health Organization estimates that household air
pollution kills about 4 million people each year, many of them
women and children, through ailments such as heart and lung
disease and cancer.
Olivia Coldrey, lead finance specialist with Sustainable
Energy for All, a U.N.-linked body that co-produced the report,
highlighted a ""continued lack of global effort"" to tackle low
access to less-polluting fuels and more efficient stoves.
""This is really an environmental and public health
emergency,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, noting that
investment in cleaner cooking was ""orders of magnitude away from
what it needs to be"".
International donor projects to boost clean cooking were
fragmented, often short-term and tended to focus on single
countries and technologies, she added.
Barbara Buchner, executive director of climate finance at
the Climate Policy Initiative, a think tank that partnered on
the annual report, called for ""a paradigm shift"" in thinking, to
focus on ensuring new fuel supplies as well as cleaner stoves.
Governments need to set stronger targets, and allocate large
budgets to help poor households afford the upfront costs of
moving to improved cooking methods, she added.
Riccardo Puliti, global director for energy and extractive
industries at the World Bank, said clean cooking should be ""a
political, economic and environmental priority"" because, without
urgent action, other global goals on health, gender and climate
change would be missed.
Last month, at a U.N. climate summit, the bank unveiled
plans for a $500-million ""Clean Cooking Fund"", supported by the
Netherlands, Norway, Denmark and Britain. It aims to increase
investment and back businesses delivering solutions.
The report said more efficient stoves that use wood and
other biomass received the greatest amount of finance in 2017.
Private-sector finance for clean cooking showed ""green
shoots"", with investment rising to about $21 million in 2017 and
accounting for two-thirds of all funding.
Kenya grabbed the lion's share, at more than 60%, of all
commitments for clean cooking that year.
The report noted that, due to the difficulty of monitoring
domestic public spending, its analysis likely under-represented
financing in some developing states that have prioritised clean
cooking, such as India and Indonesia.
Coldrey and Buchner urged development banks to work on
strategies for large-scale programmes needed to close the clean
cooking gap.
That will require a different type of support from
traditional backing for big energy infrastructure projects, they
noted.
A similar push is needed to ramp up backing for off-grid
renewable power and mini-grid systems that target the poorest
among the 840 million people still living without electricity,
they added.
The data for 2017 showed that investment in these solutions
was still a tiny proportion - just 1.2% - of total finance for
electricity access and stood at $430 million in 2017, with
Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda garnering 56% of that.
While innovative models for providing off-grid power have
proliferated, they are not yet being implemented widely enough
as the market is still learning what works, said Buchner.
The World Bank's Puliti said its off-grid portfolio was
growing rapidly, with the bank putting $600 million into
mini-grids and solar home systems in the 2018 fiscal year.
It supports the largest off-grid programme in the world in
Bangladesh, he noted, powering 2.5 million households through
1.2 million solar home systems, as well as solar irrigation
pumps and mini-grids, and 1.4 million efficient cookstoves.
Overall, finance to boost electricity access in the 20
countries where nearly four-fifths of those who lack a modern
energy supply live increased to $36 billion in 2017, after
stagnating at $30 billion in 2015 and 2016.
But only an estimated one-third of that spending went to
provide electric power in homes.

'UNACCEPTABLE' COAL
Some of the funding to boost electricity access paid for
grid-connected fossil fuel plants, mostly coal-powered, although
such funding dropped by about a fifth from the two previous
years, to $6.6 billion in 2017.
The money financed four coal plants in Bangladesh and the
Philippines, with 60% of all coal money that year coming from
the export-import banks of India and China, the report said.
Given scientific evidence that carbon emissions must be cut
further and faster to curb the accelerating impacts of climate
change, it is ""unacceptable"" for any money to be going into that
sector, said Coldrey.
She also noted that four out of the 13 sub-Saharan African
countries that have high levels of people living without
electric power had seen commitments to provide it decline in
2017, while 10 countries got less than $300 million each.
The delay in boosting electrification rates in the region
will hold back economic growth, an effect that will become more
pronounced as populations expand, she said.
""The longer we leave this hole financially, the bigger it's
going to be to fix later,"" she said.

Californian city will return a historic island to its former

could inspire other land transfers across the country.</p>
              <p>The voluntary transfer of the 280-acre Duluwat Island from

              <p>While the Wiyot held ""aboriginal title"" to the island, white
settlers in 1860 filed a claim on the land with the federal U.S.

dozens of women, children and elders during the ceremony, said
Vassel.</p>
              <p>Duluwat Island ""had been a bloody stain in the middle of
Humboldt Bay for 140 years,"" she told the Thomson Reuters
Foundation ahead of the transfer on Monday.</p>
              <p>""This model worked because it was about coming together as
people and doing what was right.""</p>
              <p>In 2000, the Wiyot purchased 1.5 acres of land on the
island, and since then the city of Eureka has transferred
additional Duluwat lands to the tribe.</p>
              <p>Last December, the city declared the island, which until
1990 served as a dockyard, surplus land and set in motion the

              <p>""I've known since I was a kid it's important to make this

              <p>ALEXANDRIA, Virginia, Oct 21 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -
O n a recent Sunday, across the Potomac River from the U.S.
capital, two pre-teen girls were dusting off a refurbished
dresser near a busy road, stocked with fruit, canned goods,
toothpaste, children's books and more.</p>
              <p>Amanda Santana and Anna Rissi, both 12, had placed the
dresser in their Alexandria neighbourhood last year and attached
written instructions: ""Take what you need, leave what you can"".</p>
              <p>And to their surprise, many have been doing just that. The
area's residents regularly fill up the ""pantry"" with
non-perishable food items, toiletries and toys to make them
readily available - for free - to anyone who needs them, the
girls said.</p>
              <p>Their local project is part of the global Little Free Pantry
movement, which gives those in need 24-hour access in their
neighbourhood to food and other basic necessities they may not
normally be able to afford.</p>
              <p>The initiative's founder, Jessica McClard, modelled it off
of the Little Free Library project, in which community members
and businesses in more than 90 countries have built freestanding
boxes in cities where the public can leave and take books.</p>
              <p>McClard built the international project's first free pantry
box in 2016, on the grounds of a church in Fayetteville,
Arkansas, a state she said is perpetually one of the most
food-insecure in the country.</p>
              <p>Many emergency meal providers have irregular hours, but the
free pantries are open all day, every day, she said.</p>
              <p>And people can use the pantries privately and anonymously,
avoiding the ""shame"" of using federal vouchers at a grocery
store - something McClard remembers from having relied on food
stamps earlier in her life.</p>
              <p>""On the one side, there's need and shame and judgment,"" she
said.</p>
              <p>""And on the other, there's trust and compassion — more of a
focus on community as opposed to individual responsibility.""</p>
              <p>As Santana and Rissi tidied their pantry in Alexandria, they
recalled meeting a man who was using it recently.</p>
              <p>""He said, 'Today for the first time in a very long time, I
had a fresh tomato,'"" Santana told the Thomson Reuters
Foundation. ""That made me smile.""</p>
              <p/>
              <p>ROOM FOR INNOVATION</p>
              <p>Hunger in the United States spiked during the 2008 recession
and has only barely recovered to previous levels, according to
government data released in September.</p>
              <p>The report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
showed that more than 11% of the population lived in
""food-insecure"" households last year.</p>
              <p>And the rate of hunger in the country is likely being
exacerbated by other costs: According to 2017 research by
Harvard University, households considered ""severely burdened"" by
housing costs spend half of what other households do on food.</p>
              <p>In the four years since McClard launched the Little Free
Pantry movement - with the motto ""Feeding Neighbours, Nourishing
Neighbourhoods"" – it has grown to 670 recorded projects, she
said, adding the real figure could be triple that.</p>
              <p>The idea has since been picked up across the country and
abroad, with projects in Europe, Canada, South Africa, the
Philippines, New Zealand and Australia, she said.</p>
              <p>Little Free Pantries work best when built on private land
that is publicly accessible, she added.</p>
              <p>Not only does such property often have fewer regulations
than public land, but many churches, schools, businesses and
community centres also have ample parking, an element of privacy
and a built-in support network.</p>
              <p>National anti-hunger organisations have taken notice.</p>
              <p>""We appreciate that (the project) not only supplements our
efforts, but also helps to raise awareness about the issue of
hunger in America,"" said Zuani Villarreal, spokeswoman for
Feeding America, a network of 200 food banks which in 2018
distributed 4.3 billion meals.</p>
              <p>PUSHBACK</p>
              <p>One of the larger Little Free Pantry networks is in South
Carolina, where two years ago Katie Dahlheim, motivated by what
she said was a polarised atmosphere nationally, built four
pantries out of old cabinets.</p>
              <p>""I was trying to find something that was universal and
everyone can agree on — and everyone has to eat,"" she said.</p>
              <p>Since then, the Lowcountry Blessing Box project has
""exploded,"" she said, and today numbers nearly 100 boxes spread
throughout a third of South Carolina; two sister projects cover
the rest of the state, Dahlheim noted.</p>
              <p>The project sees a ""huge influx"" of need each summer, when
kids are out of school and suddenly their families or friends
have to find a way to feed them three meals every day, she said.</p>
              <p>There has been pushback, she acknowledged, with some locals
saying a particular box's presence could snarl up traffic or
bring poor people into a neighbourhood.</p>
              <p>But Dahlheim said she uses those complaints as an
educational opportunity.</p>
              <p>""My response has been that poor people are always here — you
never know whose mother is sick, for instance. You can't judge
somebody based on what you're observing,"" she said.</p>
              <p>FOOD DESERTS</p>
              <p>In Indianapolis, Sierra Nuckols-Cosby is perpetually on the
hunt for old newspaper distribution boxes.</p>
              <p>In 2016, just out of college, Nuckols-Cosby became concerned
by the city's ""food deserts"", areas where people lack access to
grocery stores and their fresh produce and meats.</p>
              <p>So, she struck on the idea of creating Little Free Pantries
out of decommissioned newspaper boxes.</p>
              <p>Nuckols-Cosby, who works at a social services centre where
she focuses on food access, set up the first one in front of her
younger brother's elementary school, and her Community Food Box
Project is now up to 55 boxes, she said.</p>
              <p>She encourages people to use the sides of the boxes for
civic engagement, such as one campaign that painted some of the
boxes to raise awareness about mental health problems in black
communities.</p>
              <p>Another pantry placed in front of an upscale restaurant in a
fast-gentrifying area was decorated with a rendition of da
Vinci's ""Last Supper"", showing people eating at a long table and
others beneath the table with their mouths open, feeding on
scraps.</p>
              <p>Angry locals ended up destroying the box, Nuckols-Cosby
said.</p>
              <p>But that incident underscored the fact that Indianapolis's
poor neighbourhoods are facing a real crisis of access to food,
she said, noting that the impoverished area she works in has no
grocery stores.</p>
              <p>""The reason people were so ready for this is because they
see people in their neighbourhoods every day who are hungry, and
this is something they can do about it,"" she said, of the food
box project.</p>
              <p>Nuckols-Cosby is now working to establish her project as a
non-profit so she can raise money to create a centralised hub
that can distribute food items throughout the pantry network.</p>
              <p>She just needs a few more newspaper boxes, she said.

Philippines, New Zealand and Australia, she said.
Little Free Pantries work best when built on private land
that is publicly accessible, she added.
Not only does such property often have fewer regulations
than public land, but many churches, schools, businesses and
community centres also have ample parking, an element of privacy
and a built-in support network.
National anti-hunger organisations have taken notice.
""We appreciate that (the project) not only supplements our
efforts, but also helps to raise awareness about the issue of
hunger in America,"" said Zuani Villarreal, spokeswoman for
Feeding America, a network of 200 food banks which in 2018
distributed 4.3 billion meals.
PUSHBACK
One of the larger Little Free Pantry networks is in South
Carolina, where two years ago Katie Dahlheim, motivated by what
she said was a polarised atmosphere nationally, built four
pantries out of old cabinets.
""I was trying to find something that was universal and
everyone can agree on — and everyone has to eat,"" she said.
Since then, the Lowcountry Blessing Box project has
""exploded,"" she said, and today numbers nearly 100 boxes spread
throughout a third of South Carolina; two sister projects cover
the rest of the state, Dahlheim noted.
The project sees a ""huge influx"" of need each summer, when
kids are out of school and suddenly their families or friends
have to find a way to feed them three meals every day, she said.
There has been pushback, she acknowledged, with some locals
saying a particular box's presence could snarl up traffic or
bring poor people into a neighbourhood.
But Dahlheim said she uses those complaints as an
educational opportunity.
""My response has been that poor people are always here — you
never know whose mother is sick, for instance. You can't judge
somebody based on what you're observing,"" she said.
FOOD DESERTS
In Indianapolis, Sierra Nuckols-Cosby is perpetually on the
hunt for old newspaper distribution boxes.
In 2016, just out of college, Nuckols-Cosby became concerned
by the city's ""food deserts"", areas where people lack access to
grocery stores and their fresh produce and meats.
So, she struck on the idea of creating Little Free Pantries
out of decommissioned newspaper boxes.
Nuckols-Cosby, who works at a social services centre where
she focuses on food access, set up the first one in front of her
younger brother's elementary school, and her Community Food Box
Project is now up to 55 boxes, she said.
She encourages people to use the sides of the boxes for
civic engagement, such as one campaign that painted some of the
boxes to raise awareness about mental health problems in black
communities.
Another pantry placed in front of an upscale restaurant in a
fast-gentrifying area was decorated with a rendition of da
Vinci's ""Last Supper"", showing people eating at a long table and
others beneath the table with their mouths open, feeding on
scraps.
Angry locals ended up destroying the box, Nuckols-Cosby
said.
But that incident underscored the fact that Indianapolis's
poor neighbourhoods are facing a real crisis of access to food,
she said, noting that the impoverished area she works in has no
grocery stores.
""The reason people were so ready for this is because they
see people in their neighbourhoods every day who are hungry, and
this is something they can do about it,"" she said, of the food
box project.
Nuckols-Cosby is now working to establish her project as a
non-profit so she can raise money to create a centralised hub
that can distribute food items throughout the pantry network.
She just needs a few more newspaper boxes, she said.

war, a senior government official said.</p>
              <p>There are more than 2.6 million registered refugees in the

Abdul Baqi Popal, the deputy minister of municipalities.</p>
              <p>The government has made affordable housing a priority, with

              <p>""The aim is to formalise informal settlements, which are

              <p>LONDON, Oct 21  (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A landmark
legal challenge will be filed in Britain on Monday over cotton
imports from Uzbekistan in a case lawyers say could pave the way
to stop slave-made goods entering the European Union (EU).</p>
              <p>The legal action says imports of Uzbek cotton into EU
nations are unlawful because the bloc has applied preferential
tariffs without investigating the human rights situation in
Uzbekistan or its compliance with international law obligations.</p>
              <p>This violates EU rules and means many of its 28 members are
facilitating a trade in cotton produced by a state-driven system
of forced labour, according to the Uzbek-German Forum for Human
Rights (UGF), the civil society group behind the case.</p>
              <p>The Central Asian nation has acknowledged the use of forced
labour in its cotton harvest, and vowed to ""eradicate"" the
problem.</p>
              <p>The lawyers behind the case hope it will succeed in London's
Administrative Court - part of the High Court of Justice - and
be referred to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg where
any decision or ruling would be legally binding across the EU.</p>
              <p>Such action could range from forcing the EU to conduct due
diligence into Uzbekistan's cotton production to a ruling that
would effectively stop the entry into the bloc of goods known to
be produced by forced labour, said lawyers supporting the case.</p>
              <p>""This approach is unprecedented ... it aims to disrupt the
unhindered importation of forced labour cotton into Europe,""
said Gerry Liston, legal officer at Global Legal Action Network
(GLAN), a Britain-based charity helping UGF with the case.</p>
              <p>""If successful, it would have implications for all sorts of
goods tainted with forced labour (in the EU),"" he added.</p>
              <p>Liston pointed to a 2016 U.S. law that allows customs
officials to seize and detain goods suspected to have been made
by slave labour, and said a positive ruling could drive the EU's
legislative bodies to adopt similar measures affecting the bloc.</p>
              <p>The case comes at a vital time for EU-Uzbek relations as the
bloc is negotiating an agreement with Uzbekistan that would see
preferential tariffs extended to its textile exports, he added.</p>
              <p>A spokeswoman for trade matters with the European Commission
(EC) - the EU's executive arm - said it did not comment on legal
proceedings in front of national courts.</p>
              <p>""As regards developments in Uzbekistan, we follow them
closely, as this is relevant for our overall trade engagement,""
she said, adding that the EC followed the U.N. International
Labour Organization (ILO) on the application of work standards.</p>
              <p>The ILO last year said 93% of those who worked in the 2018
Uzbek cotton harvest did so voluntarily, and the systematic
recruitment of students, teachers, doctors and nurses had ended
- although this was disputed by human rights groups such as
UGF.</p>
              <p>In response to a request for comment put to Britain's
international trade department, a spokesman said the government
""does not generally comment on ongoing or potential litigation"".</p>
              <p>Last year Britain, which gives preferential tariffs to
Uzbekistan, imported 360,000 pounds ($455,000) of Uzbek cotton,
- 0.1% of its total cotton imports in 2018 - state data showed.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>UZBEK COTTON COMMITMENT</p>
              <p>The annual cotton harvest in Uzbekistan is the world's
largest recruitment operation, with about 2.6 million people
temporarily picking cotton every year, according to the ILO.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov, who has been opening up the
country since taking office in 2016, has vowed to stop thousands
of students, teachers and health workers from picking the
harvest, a practice widely condemned as forced labour.</p>
              <p>""The government of Uzbekistan remains fully committed to
eradicating forced labour in the cotton harvest,"" Erkin
Mukhitdinov, first deputy minister at the country's labour
ministry, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation via email.</p>
              <p>""We have taken a number of steps including increased wages,
improved working and living conditions, reduced areas allocated
for cotton production,"" he said, without responding directly to
a request for comment on the upcoming court proceedings.</p>
              <p>However, Berlin-based UGF last year said in a report that
state-imposed forced labour was still ""systematic and massive"".</p>
              <p>Under a 2012 EU regulation, Uzbek cotton imports receive a
preferential tariff under the Generalised Scheme of Preferences,
which seeks to facilitate trade with certain developing nations.</p>
              <p>But the legal motion said this regulation was void as a
matter of EU law, and cannot be applied by Britain or any member
state of the bloc to cotton imports from Uzbekistan.</p>
              <p>UGF said this was because the EU had not assessed the human
rights implications of applying tariffs to Uzbek cotton nor
considered the nation's compliance with an ILO convention on
forced labour to which it is a party.</p>
              <p>UGF Director Umida Niyazova said she hoped the legal action
would attract international attention and influence Uzbekistan's
government to change the ""system of forced labour"".</p>
              <p>""Any kind of global pressure at this point ... at this time
..  could be very effective,"" she said. ""This case could be the
last straw, and an important moment for the Uzbek people.""</p>

The ILO last year said 93% of those who worked in the 2018
Uzbek cotton harvest did so voluntarily, and the systematic
recruitment of students, teachers, doctors and nurses had ended
- although this was disputed by human rights groups such as
UGF.
In response to a request for comment put to Britain's
international trade department, a spokesman said the government
""does not generally comment on ongoing or potential litigation"".
Last year Britain, which gives preferential tariffs to
Uzbekistan, imported 360,000 pounds ($455,000) of Uzbek cotton,
- 0.1% of its total cotton imports in 2018 - state data showed.

UZBEK COTTON COMMITMENT
The annual cotton harvest in Uzbekistan is the world's
largest recruitment operation, with about 2.6 million people
temporarily picking cotton every year, according to the ILO.
Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov, who has been opening up the
country since taking office in 2016, has vowed to stop thousands
of students, teachers and health workers from picking the
harvest, a practice widely condemned as forced labour.
""The government of Uzbekistan remains fully committed to
eradicating forced labour in the cotton harvest,"" Erkin
Mukhitdinov, first deputy minister at the country's labour
ministry, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation via email.
""We have taken a number of steps including increased wages,
improved working and living conditions, reduced areas allocated
for cotton production,"" he said, without responding directly to
a request for comment on the upcoming court proceedings.
However, Berlin-based UGF last year said in a report that
state-imposed forced labour was still ""systematic and massive"".
Under a 2012 EU regulation, Uzbek cotton imports receive a
preferential tariff under the Generalised Scheme of Preferences,
which seeks to facilitate trade with certain developing nations.
But the legal motion said this regulation was void as a
matter of EU law, and cannot be applied by Britain or any member
state of the bloc to cotton imports from Uzbekistan.
UGF said this was because the EU had not assessed the human
rights implications of applying tariffs to Uzbek cotton nor
considered the nation's compliance with an ILO convention on
forced labour to which it is a party.
UGF Director Umida Niyazova said she hoped the legal action
would attract international attention and influence Uzbekistan's
government to change the ""system of forced labour"".
""Any kind of global pressure at this point ... at this time
..  could be very effective,"" she said. ""This case could be the
last straw, and an important moment for the Uzbek people.""

              <p>LONDON, Oct 18 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Britain must
ensure human traffickers do not exploit uncertainty surrounding
Brexit, from its future migration policy to cooperation with
European law enforcement agencies, the nation's anti-slavery
commissioner said on Friday.</p>
              <p>Sara Thornton said Britain would need to arrange new
partnerships across Europe to bring traffickers to justice and
""stress test"" migration systems to protect workers from labour
abuse as the country's departure from the European Union looms.</p>
              <p>While the exact nature and date of Brexit is still unclear,
activists and police say Europe-wide anti-trafficking efforts
could be hampered and that migrant workers risk being exploited
under government plans to minimise labour shortages.</p>
              <p>""Protecting victims and prosecuting traffickers is not
enough,"" Thornton said in a statement. ""To stop modern slavery
from happening in the first place, we need to do much more to
tackle the systems and structures that allow it to thrive.""</p>
              <p>""Those who traffick and trade in human beings will take any
opportunity for exploitation,"" said the former police chief, who
took up the post in May after the inaugural commissioner quit
mid-2018. ""We must not let them threaten our joint security.""</p>
              <p>Thornton on Friday published her strategy to tackle the
crime in the coming years, and said her priorities included
securing more prosecutions and improving support for victims.</p>
              <p>Too many suspected modern slaves are living in limbo as they
wait to learn if they will be recognised as victims and granted
more support, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in August.</p>
              <p>About 7,000 possible slavery victims were found in Britain
last year - up a third on 2017 - while there are an estimated
136,000 modern slaves across the country, according to the
Global Slavery Index by human rights group Walk Free Foundation.</p>
              <p>Thornton also urged businesses, public services and the
government to ""do all that they can"" to prevent trafficking and
slavery from taking place in their operations and supply chains.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>TRAFFICKERS ON NOTICE</p>
              <p>Britain has positioned itself as a leader in the global
drive to end slavery since passing the 2015 Modern Slavery Act
to jail traffickers for life, better protect vulnerable people,
and compel big companies to outline their anti-slavery measures.</p>
              <p>Yet a government-ordered review of the world-first law this
year found that a lack of convictions, limited awareness among
and training of professionals, and problems around data
collection have blunted Britain's anti-slavery response.</p>
              <p>In a report published on Thursday, the Home Office (interior
ministry) said it was committed to reforming its support system
for victims and ensuring that children received specialist care.</p>
              <p>There are more than 1,400 active law enforcement
investigations involving modern slavery across Britain, up from
about 200 at the end of 2016, according to government data.</p>
              <p>""We have made it harder than ever for trafficking gangs to
evade justice,"" said Britain's interior minister Priti Patel.</p>
              <p>The Crown Prosecution Service secured 191 modern slavery
convictions last year - up from 180 in 2017 - but the conviction
rate dipped to 65% from 68%, the statistics showed.</p>
              <p>The chief executive of charity Focus on Labour Exploitation
said she was concerned that the British government was ""failing
to grasp what meaningful protection should look like"".</p>
              <p>The government must introduce a joint liability law that
would make companies legally liable for worker abuses that occur
in their supply chains, and overturn policies that leave migrant
workers at risk of exploitation, according to Lucila Granada.</p>
              <p>""Without repealing ... hostile environment policies putting
people at risk, migrant exploitation will continue to thrive.""

partnerships across Europe to bring traffickers to justice and
""stress test"" migration systems to protect workers from labour
abuse as the country's departure from the European Union looms.
While the exact nature and date of Brexit is still unclear,
activists and police say Europe-wide anti-trafficking efforts
could be hampered and that migrant workers risk being exploited
under government plans to minimise labour shortages.
""Protecting victims and prosecuting traffickers is not
enough,"" Thornton said in a statement. ""To stop modern slavery
from happening in the first place, we need to do much more to
tackle the systems and structures that allow it to thrive.""
""Those who traffick and trade in human beings will take any
opportunity for exploitation,"" said the former police chief, who
took up the post in May after the inaugural commissioner quit
mid-2018. ""We must not let them threaten our joint security.""
Thornton on Friday published her strategy to tackle the
crime in the coming years, and said her priorities included
securing more prosecutions and improving support for victims.
Too many suspected modern slaves are living in limbo as they
wait to learn if they will be recognised as victims and granted
more support, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in August.
About 7,000 possible slavery victims were found in Britain
last year - up a third on 2017 - while there are an estimated
136,000 modern slaves across the country, according to the
Global Slavery Index by human rights group Walk Free Foundation.
Thornton also urged businesses, public services and the
government to ""do all that they can"" to prevent trafficking and
slavery from taking place in their operations and supply chains.

TRAFFICKERS ON NOTICE
Britain has positioned itself as a leader in the global
drive to end slavery since passing the 2015 Modern Slavery Act
to jail traffickers for life, better protect vulnerable people,
and compel big companies to outline their anti-slavery measures.
Yet a government-ordered review of the world-first law this
year found that a lack of convictions, limited awareness among
and training of professionals, and problems around data
collection have blunted Britain's anti-slavery response.
In a report published on Thursday, the Home Office (interior
ministry) said it was committed to reforming its support system
for victims and ensuring that children received specialist care.
There are more than 1,400 active law enforcement
investigations involving modern slavery across Britain, up from
about 200 at the end of 2016, according to government data.
""We have made it harder than ever for trafficking gangs to
evade justice,"" said Britain's interior minister Priti Patel.
The Crown Prosecution Service secured 191 modern slavery
convictions last year - up from 180 in 2017 - but the conviction
rate dipped to 65% from 68%, the statistics showed.
The chief executive of charity Focus on Labour Exploitation
said she was concerned that the British government was ""failing
to grasp what meaningful protection should look like"".
The government must introduce a joint liability law that
would make companies legally liable for worker abuses that occur
in their supply chains, and overturn policies that leave migrant
workers at risk of exploitation, according to Lucila Granada.
""Without repealing ... hostile environment policies putting
people at risk, migrant exploitation will continue to thrive.""

              <p>According to the World Bank, climate change effects could

Biron and Adela Suliman</p>
              <p>WASHINGTON/LONDON, Oct 18 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -
M usic teacher and composer Haskell Small remembers when the
noise became too much for him.</p>
              <p>""I couldn't find a place to get some fresh air without
noise,"" he said of the day a half-decade ago.</p>
              <p>Small, 71, who works out of his Washington home, said the
focus of his ire was a specific piece of lawn equipment: the
gas-powered leaf blower.</p>
              <p>""I accept that living in a city will have more noise, but
this particular type of noise is piercing and very loud -
aaargh!"" he yelled at the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p>Many in his neighbourhood felt the same way, so they
organised and, last December, convinced the city to join more
than 100 other U.S. jurisdictions in banning the blowers in
favour of quieter battery-operated machines.
Washington's action against auditory assault is just one
example of a growing trend of cities around the world
purposefully trying to slow and quiet urban life, with an eye on
improving health and wellbeing.</p>
              <p>Efforts to slow the pace of city life range from the literal
- with many cities pushing for lower speed limits on their roads
- to the imaginative, such as looking for ways to promote
mindfulness.</p>
              <p>Many of them include a recognition of the rising importance
of public spaces that are geared more toward quiet and
contemplation than efficiency and technology.</p>
              <p>Noise, for example, is the ""new secondhand smoke"", according
to the Quiet Coalition, a Massachusetts-based non-profit.</p>
              <p>""We're in a noisier and noisier world,"" said the group's
executive director, Jamie L. Banks. Finding ways to change that
is ""urgent"", he said.</p>
              <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has said the health
risks of living in noisy cities can include hearing loss,
cardiovascular disease and sleep disorders.</p>
              <p>Europe has been particularly proactive on the issue,
adopting a directive in 2002 that aims to reduce environmental
noise pollution. It warns European Union members that prolonged
exposure could lead to ""harmful effects"" on health.</p>
              <p>But in the United States, there has been no federal
regulation on noise since the late 1970s. That has left local
jurisdictions such as Washington to act in response to growing
public demand for quiet.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>'VACCINE' FOR ILLS OF MODERNITY?</p>
              <p>The idea of cities trying to lower the volume and slow down
is not new.</p>
              <p>This year, a global network of more than 260 cities will
celebrate 20 years of stepping on the brakes.</p>
              <p>The Cittaslow - or Slow City - network began in Italy in
1999 and takes its inspiration from the Slow Food movement. It
grades its members according to factors such as sustainable
infrastructure, promotion of local economies and fairness.</p>
              <p>""The effect is positive connection, because we put people in
contact with each other,"" said secretary general Pier Giorgio
Oliveti of the network that spans 30 countries so far.</p>
              <p>Cittaslow's approach could be ""a vaccine"" for the ills of
modernity, he said.</p>
              <p>For instance, since its entry into the slow-city network in
2015, Lidzbark in Poland has redeveloped its riverfront,
introduced free electric public transport, and built new bike
lanes and a public square, according to its mayor Maciej
Sitarek.</p>
              <p>""Our residents have begun to recognise the meaning of a
slower but still good life,"" he said by email.</p>
              <p>One of the network's larger members is Jeonju, a South
Korean city of about 650,000 people that sits on the Jeonjucheon
River.</p>
              <p>Part of the Cittaslow network since 2016 - though one
historic village in its boundaries joined in 2010 - Jeonju's
leaders have sought to slow the city while maintaining its
identity.</p>
              <p>They run monthly car-free zones, hope to plant 10 million
trees by 2026 and are ""transforming a straight eight-lane road
into a curvy four-lane road"" with a slower speed limit, Mayor
Seung-su Kim said in an email interview.</p>

WASHINGTON/LONDON, Oct 18 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -
M usic teacher and composer Haskell Small remembers when the
noise became too much for him.
""I couldn't find a place to get some fresh air without
noise,"" he said of the day a half-decade ago.
Small, 71, who works out of his Washington home, said the
focus of his ire was a specific piece of lawn equipment: the
gas-powered leaf blower.
""I accept that living in a city will have more noise, but
this particular type of noise is piercing and very loud -
aaargh!"" he yelled at the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Many in his neighbourhood felt the same way, so they
organised and, last December, convinced the city to join more
than 100 other U.S. jurisdictions in banning the blowers in
favour of quieter battery-operated machines.
Washington's action against auditory assault is just one
example of a growing trend of cities around the world
purposefully trying to slow and quiet urban life, with an eye on
improving health and wellbeing.
Efforts to slow the pace of city life range from the literal
- with many cities pushing for lower speed limits on their roads
- to the imaginative, such as looking for ways to promote
mindfulness.
Many of them include a recognition of the rising importance
of public spaces that are geared more toward quiet and
contemplation than efficiency and technology.
Noise, for example, is the ""new secondhand smoke"", according
to the Quiet Coalition, a Massachusetts-based non-profit.
""We're in a noisier and noisier world,"" said the group's
executive director, Jamie L. Banks. Finding ways to change that
is ""urgent"", he said.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has said the health
risks of living in noisy cities can include hearing loss,
cardiovascular disease and sleep disorders.
Europe has been particularly proactive on the issue,
adopting a directive in 2002 that aims to reduce environmental
noise pollution. It warns European Union members that prolonged
exposure could lead to ""harmful effects"" on health.
But in the United States, there has been no federal
regulation on noise since the late 1970s. That has left local
jurisdictions such as Washington to act in response to growing
public demand for quiet.

'VACCINE' FOR ILLS OF MODERNITY?
The idea of cities trying to lower the volume and slow down
is not new.
This year, a global network of more than 260 cities will
celebrate 20 years of stepping on the brakes.
The Cittaslow - or Slow City - network began in Italy in
1999 and takes its inspiration from the Slow Food movement. It
grades its members according to factors such as sustainable
infrastructure, promotion of local economies and fairness.
""The effect is positive connection, because we put people in
contact with each other,"" said secretary general Pier Giorgio
Oliveti of the network that spans 30 countries so far.
Cittaslow's approach could be ""a vaccine"" for the ills of
modernity, he said.
For instance, since its entry into the slow-city network in
2015, Lidzbark in Poland has redeveloped its riverfront,
introduced free electric public transport, and built new bike
lanes and a public square, according to its mayor Maciej
Sitarek.
""Our residents have begun to recognise the meaning of a
slower but still good life,"" he said by email.
One of the network's larger members is Jeonju, a South
Korean city of about 650,000 people that sits on the Jeonjucheon
River.
Part of the Cittaslow network since 2016 - though one
historic village in its boundaries joined in 2010 - Jeonju's
leaders have sought to slow the city while maintaining its
identity.
They run monthly car-free zones, hope to plant 10 million
trees by 2026 and are ""transforming a straight eight-lane road
into a curvy four-lane road"" with a slower speed limit, Mayor
Seung-su Kim said in an email interview.
""We are going through a phase to become a better city in the
future,"" he added.
However, the Jeonju projects have seen some pushback, Kim
acknowledged, with a share of residents complaining that the
lower speed limits make driving more complicated, while others
say trying to maintain old traditions could hamper development.
Some international experts also have expressed concern that
many of the feel-good interventions integral to the slow cities
movement mainly are available only in wealthier communities or
to people living in small towns.
Other pushback has come from industries rejecting greater
regulation.
That is a key reason the U.S. government has essentially
halted federal efforts to foster quiet across the country, said
Arline Bronzaft, professor emerita at the City University of New
York and a leading expert on noise reduction.
And not everyone considers quiet their priority.
In one community near Houston, Texas, residents in June
voted down a measure to limit landscaping noise, with some
worried the law would push up service prices and make it harder
for landscapers to make a living.
SMART VS. SLOW
For Lakshmi Rajendran, a researcher who looks at future
cities at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge, a warning bell
went off last year when the British government created a
ministerial position to counteract loneliness.
A subsequent public campaign found that almost half of
British adults report their busy lives stop them from connecting
with others.
""Efficiency is always linked with speed, which doesn't need

Rajendran and her colleagues are now looking at ways to slow

""As everyone becomes glued to their mobiles and online
communities, physical contact is being lost,"" Rajendran said.
""Slowness could help bring that back.""
'CHANGE GEARS'
In the English town of Reading, a group of residents
recently used apps and online communities to find silence
together, huddling around their phones in parks, graveyards and
bookstores.
The local walking group, led by sound artist Richard
Bentley, was part of a global citizen-led initiative in
September to map out quiet public places.
""Quiet spaces allow you to change gear,"" Bentley told the

              <p>LONDON, Oct 18 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From children
trafficked to work for drug gangs and women forced into the sex
trade to migrant labourers enslaved on farms and factories,
modern-day slavery blights Britain in many ways.</p>
              <p>About 7,000 suspected slavery victims were found in Britain
last year - up a third on 2017 - while there are an estimated
136,000 modern slaves across the country, according to the
Global Slavery Index by human rights group Walk Free Foundation.</p>
              <p>Hailed as a leader in the global drive to end slavery,
Britain passed the 2015 Modern Slavery Act to jail traffickers
for life, better protect vulnerable people, and force large
companies to outline their actions to avoid using forced labour.</p>
              <p>Yet a government-ordered review of the world-first law this
year found that a lack of convictions, limited awareness among
and training of professionals, and problems around data
collection have blunted Britain's anti-slavery response.</p>
              <p>As Britain marks Anti-Slavery Day on Oct. 18 - a day set by
parliament to raise awareness of slavery - we asked experts in
the sector for their views on the successes and failings of the
Modern Slavery Act nearly five years on. Here are the responses:</p>
              <p>PATRICIA CARRIER, MODERN SLAVERY REGISTRY PROJECT MANAGER AT THE
BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS RESOURCE CENTRE</p>
              <p>""The Modern Slavery Act was a landmark piece of legislation,
but five years on it is failing to live up to its promise. The
main problem is still enforcement – the law has no teeth.</p>
              <p>Companies face no penalty for not complying with the Act,
let alone for weak anti-slavery efforts.</p>
              <p>Bizarrely, companies can report having done nothing to
prevent modern slavery and still be in compliance with the law.</p>
              <p>Our analysis of thousands of company statements finds that
just 23% are meeting the Act's minimum requirements.</p>
              <p>The UK government should require companies to actively
identify and prevent modern slavery in their supply chains.""</p>
              <p>JAKUB SOBIK, SPOKESMAN FOR ANTI-SLAVERY INTERNATIONAL</p>
              <p>""The business reporting requirements have shifted the
conversation and companies have started to take notice of
slavery in their supply chains. Authorities and the general
public are more aware of modern slavery.</p>

LONDON, Oct 18 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From children
trafficked to work for drug gangs and women forced into the sex
trade to migrant labourers enslaved on farms and factories,
modern-day slavery blights Britain in many ways.
About 7,000 suspected slavery victims were found in Britain
last year - up a third on 2017 - while there are an estimated
136,000 modern slaves across the country, according to the
Global Slavery Index by human rights group Walk Free Foundation.
Hailed as a leader in the global drive to end slavery,
Britain passed the 2015 Modern Slavery Act to jail traffickers
for life, better protect vulnerable people, and force large
companies to outline their actions to avoid using forced labour.
Yet a government-ordered review of the world-first law this
year found that a lack of convictions, limited awareness among
and training of professionals, and problems around data
collection have blunted Britain's anti-slavery response.
As Britain marks Anti-Slavery Day on Oct. 18 - a day set by
parliament to raise awareness of slavery - we asked experts in
the sector for their views on the successes and failings of the
Modern Slavery Act nearly five years on. Here are the responses:
PATRICIA CARRIER, MODERN SLAVERY REGISTRY PROJECT MANAGER AT THE
BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS RESOURCE CENTRE
""The Modern Slavery Act was a landmark piece of legislation,
but five years on it is failing to live up to its promise. The
main problem is still enforcement – the law has no teeth.
Companies face no penalty for not complying with the Act,
let alone for weak anti-slavery efforts.
Bizarrely, companies can report having done nothing to
prevent modern slavery and still be in compliance with the law.
Our analysis of thousands of company statements finds that
just 23% are meeting the Act's minimum requirements.
The UK government should require companies to actively
identify and prevent modern slavery in their supply chains.""
JAKUB SOBIK, SPOKESMAN FOR ANTI-SLAVERY INTERNATIONAL
""The business reporting requirements have shifted the
conversation and companies have started to take notice of
slavery in their supply chains. Authorities and the general
public are more aware of modern slavery.
The biggest shortcoming is the lack of comprehensive victim
protecting measures.
In practice, it means that proper care for identified
victims is far from guaranteed and we see survivors being
detained, deported, or even sent to jail.
This plays into the hands of traffickers, as their threats
to their victims that they would be mistreated by the
authorities if they come forward are being proven true.""
AHMED AYDEED, DIRECTOR AT DUNCAN LEWIS SOLICITORS
""The Act has contributed to a greater awareness of modern
slavery in the public eye, and has also created a minimal level
of protection for trafficking victims.
However, there is still a lack of understanding of the
legislation and the government has failed, for four years now,
to publish statutory guidance.
The courts, in landmark decisions, have highlighted the
importance of adequate support for modern slavery victims and
the importance of assisting victims as soon as there is credible
suspicion of their circumstances.
It seems the courts appreciate our duties to modern slavery
victims, enshrined within statute and international conventions,
more than the government.""
TAMARA BARNETT, HEAD OF OFFICE AT THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING
FOUNDATION
""Five years on from the Act, the UK has taken significant

              <p>LONDON, Oct 18 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - British police
and prosecutors must get better at dealing with a rising number
of children caught selling drugs and recognise that they might
be victims of modern-day slavery rather than criminal suspects,
according to a former police chief.</p>
              <p>Thousands of children in Britain are estimated to be used by
gangs to carry drugs from cities to rural areas, and are
increasingly being coerced at a younger age, said Phil Brewer,
the ex-head of the Metropolitan Police's anti-slavery squad.</p>
              <p>Yet the authorities face a ""really difficult"" task in trying
to judge whether a young person found dealing drugs should be
treated as a suspect or a victim, said Brewer, who retired from
the police last month after five years in charge of the unit.</p>
              <p>Lawyers have raised concerns that many children are
prosecuted on drug charges in spite of evidence suggesting they
were compelled to commit crimes and a legal defence protecting
such defendants under the landmark 2015 Modern Slavery Act.</p>
              <p>""There needs to be a bigger emphasis on encouraging young
people to disclose what has happened to them,"" Brewer said,
explaining how many children are either too scared to speak out,
or do not see themselves as victims of grooming or exploitation.</p>
              <p>""They must feel safe in the knowledge that they can give the
names of those people that have exploited them ... and trust
that the authorities will do something about it,"" he told the
Thomson Reuters Foundation ahead of Anti-Slavery Day on Oct. 18.</p>
              <p>The number of suspected British child slaves referred to the
government last year for support more than doubled to 1,421 -
from 676 in 2017 - amid rising concern from police about the
growing so-called ""county lines"" drug trade.</p>
              <p>Government data on possible victims of modern slavery does
not break down how many children are trafficked by drug gangs,
but police and charities believe the number is rapidly rising.</p>
              <p>Britain this month pledged 20 million pounds ($25 million)
to boost efforts to disrupt the trade - from technology to track
cars suspected of being used by drug gangs to putting more
officers at railway stations seen as key transit hubs.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>""MISJUDGED LOYALTIES""</p>
              <p>Gangs are luring some children into selling drugs by telling
them they will not be punished if they say they were coerced,
citing a legal defence intended for trafficking victims, police
and prosecutors told lawmakers earlier this year.</p>
              <p>While police forces have got better recently at realising
""that the suspect in front of them might be a victim"", there is
still cause for concern and room for improvement, Brewer said.</p>
              <p>""For example, if a young person does a 'no comment'
interview and doesn't disclose who is responsible for exploiting
them ... these are elements that might be seen as an admission
of guilt.""</p>
              <p>""Children become criminalised sometimes because they don't
talk until the 11th hour, and the system doesn't respond well,""
said Brewer, who this week won a Human Trafficking Foundation
award for his anti-slavery efforts at the Metropolitan Police.</p>
              <p>The crime also presents a challenge for smaller police
forces in rural Britain who are not accustomed to young people
arriving from cities carrying drugs, he added, calling for
better cooperation between officers across different regions.</p>
              <p>Yet Brewer said he was confident that the growing use of the
Modern Slavery Act to prosecute people who force children to
sell drugs would act as a deterrent – due to the risk of heavier
prison sentences and stigma of being labelled as a trafficker.</p>
              <p>The biggest obstacle to securing justice may be the mindset
of many children caught up in the crime, said the former cop,
who is now an advisor for anti-slavery group Stop the Traffik.</p>
              <p>A former gang leader - who once recruited teenagers as drug
runners - told the Thomson Reuters Foundation last year that it
was ""too easy"" for criminals to groom children into the drug
trade with the promise of quick cash and notoriety.</p>
              <p>""Many children consider it (selling drugs) to be a lifestyle
choice ... but as a professional looking at it from the outside,
you see that is not a choice at all but the path they've been
sent down by those intent on exploiting them,"" Brewer said.</p>
              <p>""They end up committing crime based on misjudged loyalties.""

              <p>BOGOTA, Oct 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Mothers of
young men and teenagers who say their sons were murdered by
government soldiers during Colombia's conflict begged a tribunal
for answers on Thursday as the country investigates human rights
atrocities committed during its war.</p>
              <p>Colombia's five-decade war pitted leftist rebels against
government forces and right-wing paramilitary groups. Some
200,000 people were killed, 7.7 million displaced and 60,000
listed as missing, according to government figures.</p>
              <p>A 2016 peace accord between the government and
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels established
a Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) tribunal which is
investigating war crimes.</p>
              <p>Its aims including uncovering what happened during
Colombia's war and prosecuting FARC leaders and state military
officials accused of human rights abuses.</p>
              <p>Wearing T-shirts with photos of their missing sons as
handmade quilts and posters commemorating the dead lined the
Bogota courtroom's walls, a dozen mothers and other relatives
described their long quest for justice before three judges.</p>
              <p>""I want to know the truth about what happened to my son, who
did it and why. Who took him away?,"" said Beatriz Mendez, whose
19-year-old son and a nephew disappeared in 2004.</p>
              <p>""I've been waiting for more than a decade for justice. There
will be divine justice,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation
as other mothers hugged and wiped away tears.</p>
              <p>The rights abuses are among the so-called ""false positives""
scandal that rocked Colombia in the late 2000s, when army units
were found to have killed civilians and listed them as
guerrillas killed in combat to inflate casualty numbers.</p>
              <p>Some officers accused of involvement have appeared before
the JEP tribunal, while dozens of soldiers and officers have
been convicted of crimes tied to the scandal since 2008 and are
in prison. Dozens more have been fired.</p>
              <p>Colombia's attorney general's office is also investigating
nearly 2,300 similar cases of alleged extra-judicial killings
when victims, some as young as 16, were often lured from their
homes in Bogota's slum neighborhoods by the promise of work.</p>
              <p>""Our duty is to reach those who are the most responsible,""
judge Catalina Diaz told the hearing.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>REDUCED JAILED SENTENCES</p>
              <p>The peace accord allows for former rebels and others who
come forward to receive reduced sentences and avoid prison if
they confess to crimes and repay victims, including any land and
property seizures.</p>
              <p>Those admitting to war crimes will be sentenced to five to
eight years of ""alternative punishment"". What that will mean in
reality remains unclear, but options could include community
service, restricted freedom or house arrest.</p>
              <p>Those who neither confess nor accept responsibility and are

BOGOTA, Oct 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Mothers of
young men and teenagers who say their sons were murdered by
government soldiers during Colombia's conflict begged a tribunal
for answers on Thursday as the country investigates human rights
atrocities committed during its war.
Colombia's five-decade war pitted leftist rebels against
government forces and right-wing paramilitary groups. Some
200,000 people were killed, 7.7 million displaced and 60,000
listed as missing, according to government figures.
A 2016 peace accord between the government and
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels established
a Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) tribunal which is
investigating war crimes.
Its aims including uncovering what happened during
Colombia's war and prosecuting FARC leaders and state military
officials accused of human rights abuses.
Wearing T-shirts with photos of their missing sons as
handmade quilts and posters commemorating the dead lined the
Bogota courtroom's walls, a dozen mothers and other relatives
described their long quest for justice before three judges.
""I want to know the truth about what happened to my son, who
did it and why. Who took him away?,"" said Beatriz Mendez, whose
19-year-old son and a nephew disappeared in 2004.
""I've been waiting for more than a decade for justice. There
will be divine justice,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation
as other mothers hugged and wiped away tears.
The rights abuses are among the so-called ""false positives""
scandal that rocked Colombia in the late 2000s, when army units
were found to have killed civilians and listed them as
guerrillas killed in combat to inflate casualty numbers.
Some officers accused of involvement have appeared before
the JEP tribunal, while dozens of soldiers and officers have
been convicted of crimes tied to the scandal since 2008 and are
in prison. Dozens more have been fired.
Colombia's attorney general's office is also investigating
nearly 2,300 similar cases of alleged extra-judicial killings
when victims, some as young as 16, were often lured from their
homes in Bogota's slum neighborhoods by the promise of work.
""Our duty is to reach those who are the most responsible,""
judge Catalina Diaz told the hearing.

REDUCED JAILED SENTENCES
The peace accord allows for former rebels and others who
come forward to receive reduced sentences and avoid prison if
they confess to crimes and repay victims, including any land and
property seizures.
Those admitting to war crimes will be sentenced to five to
eight years of ""alternative punishment"". What that will mean in
reality remains unclear, but options could include community
service, restricted freedom or house arrest.
Those who neither confess nor accept responsibility and are
found guilty could face up to 20 years in jail.
The peace accord has been criticized by some Colombians who
demand tougher sanctions and jail for FARC rebels.
But judge Ivan Gonzalez emphasized that the JEP is focused
on ensuring victims learn the truth about what happened and
receive reparations as outlined in the peace accord.
""The more truth and reparations there are, the less jail
time there is,"" he said.
Besides extra-judicial killings, judges are sifting through
thousands of victim testimonies and investigating select cases
as most representative of the atrocities, including kidnapping
and the recruitment of children as fighters into FARC ranks.
""In the case of (child) recruitment we have 8,800 cases, so
to investigate this really takes a long time,"" Gonzalez said.
He said it is hoped the JEP can build a case on the use of
sexual violence by FARC rebels, including forced abortions
against women and girls in guerrilla ranks, and examine whether
guerrillas used rape as a weapon of war.

              <p>BARCELONA, Oct 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Britain's
response to escalating climate protests on London's streets this
month, with mass arrests and tighter restrictions, is consistent
with a ""global pattern of suppression"" of environmental
activists, said a U.N. human rights expert.</p>
              <p>Those who oppose environmentally damaging projects such as
coal plants or mines face worse challenges in other parts of the
world like Latin America and Southeast Asia, where they suffer
violence, harassment and intimidation, said David R. Boyd, the
U.N. special rapporteur on human rights and the environment.</p>
              <p>But London police moves to dismantle protest camps set up by
the Extinction Rebellion group and prevent its members gathering
""is a disturbing precedent that other governments will utilise
to their advantage"", Boyd told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p>Police on Monday ordered that any ""assembly"" linked to the
two-week Extinction Rebellion ""Autumn Uprising"" should cease.</p>
              <p>Activists petitioned for a swift judicial review, but were
told on Thursday a High Court hearing would be held on the case
on Oct. 24, after the protests are scheduled to end.</p>
              <p>""While we are disappointed that the court is not able to
hear the application sooner - particularly given the immediate
risk of people being unlawfully arrested for peaceful,
non-violent protest - we nonetheless look forward to putting
forward our arguments next week,"" Extinction Rebellion's legal
team said in a statement.</p>
              <p>The London protests have seen climate activists block roads
and disrupt traffic near government buildings and corporate
offices, as well as at train stations and London City Airport.</p>
              <p>Despite the clampdown, the actions have continued, including
a large rally in Trafalgar Square Wednesday afternoon.</p>
              <p>More than 1,710 people have now been arrested since the
protests began on Oct. 7, police said.</p>
              <p>Boyd said rights to freedom of expression and association
were clearly enshrined in the UK Human Rights Act, and were
being curtailed under the current policing approach.</p>
              <p>The authorities can step in ""if public safety is
jeopardised, if there is disorder or crime happening"", he noted.</p>
              <p>But the Extinction Rebellion protests seemed to have been
non-violent and carefully planned, he added.</p>
              <p>""What is unfortunate is that we're living through a global
climate emergency - that is clear from the scientific evidence -
and instead of responding with appropriate urgency to tackle the
causes... governments are putting their efforts into tackling
protesters instead,"" Boyd said in an interview.</p>
              <p>On Thursday, the 14-member International Network of Civil
Liberties Organizations expressed concern that the London
protest prohibition ""is disproportionate and constitutes a
serious interference with the right to protest"", and called for
it to be reversed.</p>
              <p>The Metropolitan Police Service said on its website that it
had not banned protests by climate activists. ""What we cannot
allow is for central London to be brought to a standstill,"" said
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor.</p>
              <p>Britain's Home Office said operational decisions were a
matter for the police.</p>
              <p>The right to protest peacefully was a long-standing
tradition in Britain and ""a vital foundation of our democracy"",
it said in an emailed statement.</p>
              <p>But it said it was also essential that ""people can go about
their daily business without disruption"".</p>
              <p>The government has highlighted its efforts to act on climate
change. Four months ago, Britain became the first major economy
to legislate for net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>
              <p>This week it announced a new Environment Bill, as well as
stepped-up measures to tackle climate change, including a plan
to accelerate the decarbonisation of transport and improve
energy efficiency in buildings.</p>
              <p>Craig Bennett, CEO of green group Friends of the Earth,
however, told Wednesday's rally in Trafalgar Square that the
government's assertion it was doing more to address climate
threats than other nations was insufficient.</p>
              <p>""The only thing that's relevant is whether the government is
doing enough,"" he said, noting scientists had urged far more
rapid action to cut climate-changing emissions, so as to limit
global impacts such as worsening hunger, heatwaves and storms.</p>
              <p>One of the key demands of the Extinction Rebellion movement
is for Britain's net-zero target to be brought forward to 2025.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>ANGRY YOUTH</p>
              <p>Boyd, who is also an associate professor of law, policy and
sustainability at Canada's University of British Columbia, said
governments around the world ""for several decades have failed to
take adequate action to address the climate crisis"".</p>
              <p>That delay is why young people now are angry about the slow
pace of change, he said.</p>
              <p>The past year has seen Friday school strikes and
demonstrations by children and students grow in many countries,
as they demand politicians do more to curb global warming.</p>
              <p>Young protesters also are seeking a say in decisions that
affect the climate and environment.</p>
              <p>The U.N. rapporteur - who will next week present a report to
the United Nations saying climate change is already harming
billions of people, violating human rights and exacerbating
inequality - warned even those protests could lead to arrests if
they continued to expand.</p>
              <p>A mass march led by young climate strikers, including
Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, last month attracted an
estimated 4 million people around the world.</p>
              <p>""There is no question that, at some point, those protests
will cross the line as well from the governments' perspective,
and that will be a pretty ugly day when we start to see young
people arrested,"" Boyd said.</p>
              <p>""Unless governments start responding substantively to
demands that children and youth are making, those children and
youth are going to reach a point of frustration where things
will boil over,"" he added.

offices, as well as at train stations and London City Airport.
Despite the clampdown, the actions have continued, including
a large rally in Trafalgar Square Wednesday afternoon.
More than 1,710 people have now been arrested since the
protests began on Oct. 7, police said.
Boyd said rights to freedom of expression and association
were clearly enshrined in the UK Human Rights Act, and were
being curtailed under the current policing approach.
The authorities can step in ""if public safety is
jeopardised, if there is disorder or crime happening"", he noted.
But the Extinction Rebellion protests seemed to have been
non-violent and carefully planned, he added.
""What is unfortunate is that we're living through a global
climate emergency - that is clear from the scientific evidence -
and instead of responding with appropriate urgency to tackle the
causes... governments are putting their efforts into tackling
protesters instead,"" Boyd said in an interview.
On Thursday, the 14-member International Network of Civil
Liberties Organizations expressed concern that the London
protest prohibition ""is disproportionate and constitutes a
serious interference with the right to protest"", and called for
it to be reversed.
The Metropolitan Police Service said on its website that it
had not banned protests by climate activists. ""What we cannot
allow is for central London to be brought to a standstill,"" said
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor.
Britain's Home Office said operational decisions were a
matter for the police.
The right to protest peacefully was a long-standing
tradition in Britain and ""a vital foundation of our democracy"",
it said in an emailed statement.
But it said it was also essential that ""people can go about
their daily business without disruption"".
The government has highlighted its efforts to act on climate
change. Four months ago, Britain became the first major economy
to legislate for net-zero emissions by 2050.
This week it announced a new Environment Bill, as well as
stepped-up measures to tackle climate change, including a plan
to accelerate the decarbonisation of transport and improve
energy efficiency in buildings.
Craig Bennett, CEO of green group Friends of the Earth,
however, told Wednesday's rally in Trafalgar Square that the
government's assertion it was doing more to address climate
threats than other nations was insufficient.
""The only thing that's relevant is whether the government is
doing enough,"" he said, noting scientists had urged far more
rapid action to cut climate-changing emissions, so as to limit
global impacts such as worsening hunger, heatwaves and storms.
One of the key demands of the Extinction Rebellion movement
is for Britain's net-zero target to be brought forward to 2025.

ANGRY YOUTH
Boyd, who is also an associate professor of law, policy and
sustainability at Canada's University of British Columbia, said
governments around the world ""for several decades have failed to
take adequate action to address the climate crisis"".
That delay is why young people now are angry about the slow
pace of change, he said.
The past year has seen Friday school strikes and
demonstrations by children and students grow in many countries,
as they demand politicians do more to curb global warming.
Young protesters also are seeking a say in decisions that
affect the climate and environment.
The U.N. rapporteur - who will next week present a report to
the United Nations saying climate change is already harming
billions of people, violating human rights and exacerbating
inequality - warned even those protests could lead to arrests if
they continued to expand.
A mass march led by young climate strikers, including
Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, last month attracted an
estimated 4 million people around the world.
""There is no question that, at some point, those protests
will cross the line as well from the governments' perspective,
and that will be a pretty ugly day when we start to see young
people arrested,"" Boyd said.
""Unless governments start responding substantively to
demands that children and youth are making, those children and
youth are going to reach a point of frustration where things
will boil over,"" he added.

LONDON, Oct 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - It was bad
enough to be stolen from home and trafficked over the seas into
slavery - but rescued children say Britain offers scant solace
or support once they escape their ordeal.
Victims of trafficking testified in parliament on Wednesday
about falling into slavery and how they struggled in its
aftermath, saying Britain falls far short of its reputation as a
leader in the fight against modern slavery.
“We’re getting confused, we are scared every night that they
will send us back. We cannot sleep,” Anna, a 16-year-old from
the Horn of Africa, told a room of fellow survivors, policy
makers and advocates.
Her name has been changed to protect her identity.
Anna is one of millions of child victims in a network that
enslaves 40.3 million people in everything from forced labour to
sex work, according to the International Labour Organization.
In Britain, 3,137 children suspected of being trafficked
were referred to the government last year, an increase of 48% on
2017 and the highest annual number on record.
Most were British, while hundreds come from as far afield as
Albania to Eritrea, many then coerced into selling drugs for
dealers as they expand business outside the big cities,
according to government figures.
Experts in child trafficking - from temporary carers to
Britain's slavery tsar - agreed the system needed an overhaul,
saying more must be done to slash red tape and speed trafficked
children back into some sort of normal.
“The system needs to wake up and get a move on and just
apply some common sense really,” said Vernon Coaker, moderator
of the event and an opposition member of the British parliament.
“It’s wrong when a system is set up where people have to
fight all the time to get what should just happen.”

LEADER
Britain is considered an international leader in the fight
against slavery, having passed the 2015 Modern Slavery Act to
jail traffickers for life, better protect vulnerable people, and
compel large businesses to address the threat of forced labour.
Yet child victims have no legal guarantee of specialist
support nor any right to remain in Britain post-trafficking,

              <p>BANGKOK, Oct 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A Thai
trafficker was sentenced to a record 374 years in jail for child
trafficking in a ruling that lawyers say will send a deterrent
to other criminals.</p>
              <p>Yuttana Kodsap, 31, was found guilty of child trafficking
for the purpose of pornography after he lured children aged 7-12
to play computer games at his house where he filmed sexual acts
with them and sold the videos on a chat app, police said.</p>
              <p>A court in Thailand's southern province of Phang Nga
sentenced him to 374 years in jail for his crimes and ordered
him to pay 800,000 Thai baht ($26,000) in compensation to each
of the five victims, according to court documents provided to
the Thomson Reuters Foundation by the Court of Justice.</p>
              <p>The case was the second trafficking case in Thailand in
which offenders were sentenced to more than 300 years in
jail. Last year the criminal court sentenced three men to up to
309 years each for trafficking children for prostitution.</p>
              <p>In both cases, courts capped the imprisonment period at 50
years in accordance with Thai law.</p>
              <p>Papop Siamhan, an independent lawyer with expertise in human
trafficking, said child prostitution cases resulted in long
prison sentences because they often involved several laws and
many children.</p>
              <p>""Long prison sentences will act as a deterrent because
people will be afraid to commit such crimes, and it will also
result in authorities and judges being more careful when
handling such cases,"" he said.</p>
              <p>Earlier this year the United States praised Thailand for
sentencing convicted traffickers and complicit officials to
significant prison terms in its annual Trafficking in Persons
(TIP) report.</p>
              <p>Thailand was ranked as a Tier 2 country in the report,
meaning it is making significant efforts to combat the crime.</p>
              <p>Since January this year, courts have handed down 170 prison
sentences in trafficking cases of which 74 were sentences of
more than 10 years, according to the Court of Justice.</p>
              <p>Archana Kotecha, Asia region director and head of legal at
anti-slavery charity Liberty Shared, said long sentences can be
effective deterrents when they are addressed at kingpins in
trafficking cases and not low level offenders.</p>
              <p>But she said this must be accompanied by seizure of assets
which should be used to pay compensation to victims.</p>
              <p>""Deterrence aimed at the freedom and assets of offenders is
likely more effective and holistic as it takes into account the
need to compensate victims for what they have endured and
removes the commercial gain made by the offender,"" she said.</p>

The case was the second trafficking case in Thailand in
which offenders were sentenced to more than 300 years in
jail. Last year the criminal court sentenced three men to up to
309 years each for trafficking children for prostitution.
In both cases, courts capped the imprisonment period at 50
years in accordance with Thai law.
Papop Siamhan, an independent lawyer with expertise in human
trafficking, said child prostitution cases resulted in long
prison sentences because they often involved several laws and
many children.
""Long prison sentences will act as a deterrent because
people will be afraid to commit such crimes, and it will also
result in authorities and judges being more careful when
handling such cases,"" he said.
Earlier this year the United States praised Thailand for
sentencing convicted traffickers and complicit officials to
significant prison terms in its annual Trafficking in Persons
(TIP) report.
Thailand was ranked as a Tier 2 country in the report,
meaning it is making significant efforts to combat the crime.
Since January this year, courts have handed down 170 prison
sentences in trafficking cases of which 74 were sentences of
more than 10 years, according to the Court of Justice.
Archana Kotecha, Asia region director and head of legal at
anti-slavery charity Liberty Shared, said long sentences can be
effective deterrents when they are addressed at kingpins in
trafficking cases and not low level offenders.
But she said this must be accompanied by seizure of assets
which should be used to pay compensation to victims.
""Deterrence aimed at the freedom and assets of offenders is
likely more effective and holistic as it takes into account the
need to compensate victims for what they have endured and
removes the commercial gain made by the offender,"" she said.

collecting, what it is for, and admit when there are mistakes.""
This is particularly relevant to poorer residents and those
who are not tech-savvy and may be excluded, said Colin Fernandes
at the Global Disaster Preparedness Center, a unit of the
American Red Cross.
""Data collection often misses those in informal settlements,
who are usually the most vulnerable to disasters and climate
change risks, and most in need of welfare benefits and other
assistance,"" he said.
""There is a failure to collect data, or a reluctance on
their part to give up data, because they don't know whether the
data will be used to evict them or protect them. They need to be
assured of what they are signing up for.""

              <p>""In Dubai it's better if you're driving.""</p>
              <p>With more than one vehicle for every two people - according

              <p>Having invested almost 100 billion dirhams ($27 billion) on

              <p>The cube-shaped vehicles built in Italy by California-based
firm NEXT Future Transportation can carry up to 10 people each

pods are released to collect more passengers.</p>
              <p>""It's like a relay race,"" said inventor Tommaso Gecchelin,
who co-founded the company.</p>
              <p>With a top speed of 90 km per hour (56 miles per hour) and
measuring 6.5 square metres (70 square feet) each, the pods look
like ""rooms on wheels"", he said in a phone interview.</p>
              <p>They can also include bars, toilets and check-in facilities
for people headed to the airport.</p>
              <p>A fleet of 1,000 could help Dubai cut traffic congestion by
up to 50%, by allowing people like Irechukwu to move around in
affordable comfort all year round, Gecchelin estimated.</p>
              <p>The company plans to start mass production by the end of
next year and have at least four pods ready to ferry visitors
within the Dubai 2020 Expo site, after it tested two prototypes
in the city in 2018.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>NO PILOT</p>
              <p>The pod trials come under the city's plans to make a quarter
of daily transportation self-driven by 2030, which Dubai's Roads
and Transport Authority says could help significantly cut
transportation costs, road accidents and pollution.</p>

been looking into self-driving cars, ""sky pods"" that run on
suspended rails and flying taxis.</p>
              <p>In 2017, the city launched its bid to become the world's
first city with a drone taxi service when an unmanned two-seater
drone resembling a small helicopter cabin topped by a wide hoop
studded with 18 propellers took its maiden flight within the
emirate.</p>
              <p>Alexander Zosel, co-founder of Volocopter, the German
company that built the sky cab, said 1,000 drones taking off and
landing vertically from at least 30 ports across the city could
move 10,000 people around per hour.</p>
              <p>A ride in a flying cab would cost around the same as one
that drives on the road, he added.</p>

              <p>FLYING OR WALKING?</p>
              <p>While autonomous cars and flying taxis might be the future
of transport in Dubai, they will not work everywhere, said Rode
of LSE Cities.</p>
              <p>Some cities trying to reduce car usage might not want a
proliferation of privately-owned self-driving vehicles, which
risk increasing traffic while they drive around empty, looking
for parking or trying to pick up their owners, he said.</p>
              <p>""Autonomous vehicles have to be based on shared mobility ...
otherwise you risk replacing one inefficient mode of transport
with another.""</p>
              <p>And flying taxis could also cause undesirable side-effects,

              <p>Instead of looking at new ways to get people where they need

about the same population as Madrid, but covers an area more

              <p>HONG KONG, Oct 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When
authorities drew up a plan to make Hong Kong a hub for Asia's
wine trade, they faced a big challenge: where to store the
bottles in a city that was fast running out of space. So they
went underground.</p>
              <p>Officials presented World War Two-era bunkers as potential
sites, and former diplomat Gregory De'eb and businessman Jim
Thompson signed a lease on them, setting up Hong Kong's first
commercial wine cellar 20 metres (66 ft) below ground in 2003.</p>
              <p>Crown Wine Cellars can store more than 100,000 bottles, and
also has a subterranean clubhouse.</p>
              <p>""It is the underground aspect of the club that is its most
attractive and popular feature,"" said De'eb. ""Members even view
the lack of mobile phone reception as overwhelmingly positive.""</p>
              <p>Hong Kong plans to move more facilities beneath the Earth's
surface to free up space above, in one of the world's priciest
real-estate markets.</p>
              <p>With almost 70% of the global population expected to be
living in urban areas by 2050, according to the United Nations,
cities are coming under the spotlight as never before.</p>
              <p>From Singapore to sub-Saharan Africa, they are fast running
out of space to house their swelling populations.</p>
              <p>Cities have long put metro rail networks, as well as
utilities like sewage and water pipes underground, with several
also moving commercial, retail and storage facilities down below
to free up space or better handle extreme temperatures.</p>
              <p>In Hong Kong, known for its towering skyscrapers and wooded
hills, sky-high home prices have boosted the urgency of
maximising use of underground space.</p>
              <p>The government has vowed to create more land for housing,
including by building artificial islands.</p>
              <p>It is also looking to use underground space for waste
treatment, data centres, water reservoirs, power stations,
crematoriums and sports facilities.</p>
              <p>The city's rocky terrain lends itself to cavern development
as a ""cost-effective alternative"" for long-term land supply that
offers safety, environmental and security benefits, said Edward
Lo, Hong Kong's chief town planner.</p>
              <p>""Given the lack of land resources in Hong Kong, it has all
along been our policy objective to develop underground space,""
he added.</p>

              <p>'BAD' NEIGHBOURS</p>
              <p>From the catacombs of ancient Rome to step wells in medieval

HONG KONG, Oct 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When
authorities drew up a plan to make Hong Kong a hub for Asia's
wine trade, they faced a big challenge: where to store the
bottles in a city that was fast running out of space. So they
went underground.
Officials presented World War Two-era bunkers as potential
sites, and former diplomat Gregory De'eb and businessman Jim
Thompson signed a lease on them, setting up Hong Kong's first
commercial wine cellar 20 metres (66 ft) below ground in 2003.
Crown Wine Cellars can store more than 100,000 bottles, and
also has a subterranean clubhouse.
""It is the underground aspect of the club that is its most
attractive and popular feature,"" said De'eb. ""Members even view
the lack of mobile phone reception as overwhelmingly positive.""
Hong Kong plans to move more facilities beneath the Earth's
surface to free up space above, in one of the world's priciest
real-estate markets.
With almost 70% of the global population expected to be
living in urban areas by 2050, according to the United Nations,
cities are coming under the spotlight as never before.
From Singapore to sub-Saharan Africa, they are fast running
out of space to house their swelling populations.
Cities have long put metro rail networks, as well as
utilities like sewage and water pipes underground, with several
also moving commercial, retail and storage facilities down below
to free up space or better handle extreme temperatures.
In Hong Kong, known for its towering skyscrapers and wooded
hills, sky-high home prices have boosted the urgency of
maximising use of underground space.
The government has vowed to create more land for housing,
including by building artificial islands.
It is also looking to use underground space for waste
treatment, data centres, water reservoirs, power stations,
crematoriums and sports facilities.
The city's rocky terrain lends itself to cavern development
as a ""cost-effective alternative"" for long-term land supply that
offers safety, environmental and security benefits, said Edward
Lo, Hong Kong's chief town planner.
""Given the lack of land resources in Hong Kong, it has all
along been our policy objective to develop underground space,""
he added.

'BAD' NEIGHBOURS
From the catacombs of ancient Rome to step wells in medieval
India and army bunkers, underground spaces have been used for a
variety of reasons down the ages.
Helsinki and Montreal, which are blanketed in snow for
several months of the year, are considered leaders in
""underground urbanism"", a movement focused on innovative ways to
use underground space.
Besides mass transit, growing concerns around the
environmental and health impacts of ""bad neighbour"" facilities
such as refuse transfer and waste treatment plants have pushed
cities to consider moving those below ground as well.
Underground space is ideal for a densely populated city like
Hong Kong, which has more than 7 million people crammed into an
area of about 1,100 square kilometres (425 square miles), with
less than a quarter of that land available for development.
About a decade ago, authorities unveiled a policy aimed at
studying the opportunities in underground space.
In a government-commissioned study, consultancy Arup
identified 48 potential underground and hillside sites for new
caverns, and some 400 state facilities that could be moved
underground.
""The idea was to better integrate facilities, so people can
easily move between them, and avoid the conflicts of traffic and

And less energy is needed because of more stable
temperatures underground, an important factor for cities looking
to curb their carbon emissions.
Underground structures also perform better in earthquakes
and need fewer repairs, while offering better protection from
typhoons and thunderstorms, which are forecast to become more
severe as global temperatures rise.
Cheaper, fast-digging technologies such as those used by
billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk to build a high-speed
transport tunnel in Los Angeles, meanwhile, can cut construction
time and minimise disruption above ground.
""As older urban areas in Hong Kong deteriorate and new
infrastructure or redevelopment is needed, underground
development is a way to build new facilities with minimum
disruption to the surface and public,"" Wallace said.

ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS
Elsewhere in Asia, space constraints and security concerns
prompted the development of underground space decades ago in
Japan and South Korea.
More than 20 Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai and
Shenzhen are now making plans for urban underground space, while
Singapore unveiled an underground master-plan this year.
Hong Kong, like Singapore, has traditionally relied on
reclaimed land, but that is seen as increasingly unsustainable
because it fuels environmentally harmful processes like sand
mining, said Mee Kam Ng, director of the urban studies programme
at The Chinese University of Hong Kong.
Digging out space underground can also have effects on
groundwater and surface ecology, she said.
Instead, Hong Kong could free up nearly 4,000 hectares
through better planning for its existing land resources such as
the largely rural New Territories in the north, she said, citing
research by the Citizens Task Force, a non-profit network.
Some residents are resistant to the idea of tearing up parks
to create shopping malls underground.
An ongoing study of potential underground development in
Tsim Sha Tsui has drawn criticism from planners and locals, who
say any benefits will be outweighed by the damage to Kowloon
Park, a green oasis in the congested city.
The plan proposes that underground spaces be built beneath

Areas of the park could be affected for up to seven years

              <p>LONDON, Oct 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A lawyer
working with Extinction Rebellion climate protesters in London
said the group hopes a court hearing on Thursday will rule that
a police ban on their public gatherings this week is unlawful,
as U.N. experts said it violated their human rights.</p>
              <p>The Metropolitan Police said on Monday it had tightened
rules on the two-week Extinction Rebellion ""Autumn Uprising""
because there had been breaches of public order regulations and
""ongoing serious disruption to the community"".</p>
              <p>""Anyone who fails to comply... is liable for arrest and
prosecution,"" it added on its website.</p>
              <p>At an Extinction Rebellion rally in London's Trafalgar
Square on Wednesday, speakers denounced the protest restrictions
before a crowd of nearly 500 activists, flanked by police in
day-glow vests.</p>
              <p>Craig Bennett, CEO of green group Friends of the Earth,
called the temporary order ""draconian, appalling, shocking"".</p>
              <p>""When the state tries to shut down lawful, peaceful protest,
you know the state has lost its argument,"" he said, as activists
- many with black tape over their mouths - hoisted magenta and
blue silk flags sporting Extinction Rebellion's hourglass logo.</p>
              <p>Bennett, speaking through a megaphone, said greater
restrictions on civil rights to protest were something ""we
should all be very worried about"".</p>
              <p>Caroline Russell, a Green Party member of the London
Assembly, said ""it is absolutely essential that we stand firm
about the right to protest"".</p>
              <p>In the crowd, activists carried homemade placards reading,
""Banning peaceful protest is like banning fire alarms"" and ""We
know it's scary! But silencing us won't make it go away"".</p>
              <p/>
              <p>LEGAL CLARITY</p>
              <p>David R. Boyd, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights
and the environment, said the police move to stop Extinction
Rebellion members assembling in London was ""clearly a violation
of human rights, including freedom of expression and freedom of

              <p>""A preferable response would be to invest additional
resources in responding to the global climate emergency instead
of investing more money in policing,"" said Boyd, who is also an
associate professor of law, policy and sustainability at
Canada's University of British Columbia.</p>
              <p>Philip Alston, the U.N. special rapporteur on extreme
poverty and human rights, described the London police order to
end the demonstrations as ""climate apartheid in action"".</p>
              <p>Climate change hits the poor first and hardest, he noted,
while ""the rich are in denial but also taking precautions to

              <p>""Meanwhile, the government uses the forces of law and order

said in emailed comments to the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p>""The existential threat of climate change and the imperative
need to accommodate public protest cannot be addressed

              <p>On Tuesday, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he had not been

              <p>Some of the company's buses had been slightly diverted, she
said, but streets blocked by protests had produced unaccustomed
quiet and more pedestrian footfall.</p>
              <p>""It was better without the cars - no smoke, no beep-beep,""
she said. ""I agree with (the protesters). I think they should
just keep going.""</p>
              <p>Matthew Shribman, a science communicator who produces online
videos aimed at making science more accessible, told activists
at Trafalgar Square that their demonstrations were having the

              <p>""This movement is making people listen the world over,"" he
said.</p>
              <p>But Jackie Miller, an Australian tourist from Sydney,
visiting Trafalgar Square with her two daughters, said she saw
the protest's main effect as diverting police power from other
areas.</p>
              <p>""I don't believe in protesting. I don't think it gets you
anywhere,"" the 44-year-old said. Yet when it came to demanding
action on climate change, ""I can see their point,"" she added.</p>
              <p>Jeff Michels, 27, who lives in Brussels and was visiting the

attention to an issue too few people took seriously enough.</p>
              <p>""To get action, you need people to feel uncomfortable,"" he
said. With popular support for climate action growing, the
protests ""will keep coming back"", he predicted.

""It was better without the cars - no smoke, no beep-beep,""
she said. ""I agree with (the protesters). I think they should
just keep going.""
Matthew Shribman, a science communicator who produces online
videos aimed at making science more accessible, told activists
at Trafalgar Square that their demonstrations were having the
desired effect of making more people aware of climate risks.
""This movement is making people listen the world over,"" he
said.
But Jackie Miller, an Australian tourist from Sydney,
visiting Trafalgar Square with her two daughters, said she saw
the protest's main effect as diverting police power from other
areas.
""I don't believe in protesting. I don't think it gets you
anywhere,"" the 44-year-old said. Yet when it came to demanding
action on climate change, ""I can see their point,"" she added.
Jeff Michels, 27, who lives in Brussels and was visiting the
National Gallery art museum adjoining Trafalgar Square with a
friend, said he felt disruptive protests were necessary to draw
attention to an issue too few people took seriously enough.
""To get action, you need people to feel uncomfortable,"" he
said. With popular support for climate action growing, the
protests ""will keep coming back"", he predicted.

              <p>By Sebastien Malo</p>
              <p>DULUTH, Minnesota, Oct 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -
B efore the advent of air conditioning, this northern U.S. city
on the shore of Lake Superior promoted itself as a cool summer
haven for the sweaty and allergy affected.</p>
              <p>One day Duluth might offer another kind of relief: As a
haven for future U.S. migrants fleeing runaway heatwaves and
other extreme weather elsewhere in the country.</p>
              <p>The Minnesota town, nestled along the world's largest
freshwater lake, is among a small group of cities that
scientists predict will become top destinations for Americans
abandoning parts of the country one day made inhospitable by
climate change.</p>
              <p>Up to now, frigid winters in Duluth - often ranked one of
the coldest cities in the United States - have limited its
appeal. The city, planned to one day become as large as Chicago,
never quite achieved its aims, as vacant lots testify.</p>
              <p>But Sandy Hoff, the president and owner of local real estate
development firm F.I. Salter, said a changing climate could spur
a property boom that would ""no doubt"" propel his company in ways
unseen since his grandfather acquired it 90 years ago.</p>
              <p>""Duluth, in particular on the shore of the lake here, has
tended to be a little cooler maybe than people have wanted at
times in the past,"" he admitted.</p>
              <p>""Maybe a little climate change, where we're getting a little
warmer, is beneficial to us,"" he said.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>NO JOKE</p>
              <p>Predictions that a wave of Americans could one day wash in
as a result of climate threats leave many residents part
intrigued, part skeptical.</p>
              <p>Karen Pagel Guerndt, a realtor, joked that she hopes people
don't hear about Harvard professor Jesse Keenan's research
suggesting Duluth is well-situated to become a climate
sanctuary.</p>
              <p>""We don't want to be a big city,"" she said.</p>
              <p>She's kidding, of course, she said - after all, she sells
homes in Duluth for a living.</p>
              <p>Some early climate migrants already are already buying them.</p>
              <p>Angel Dobrow, her husband Bob and their dog arrived in
Duluth in 2017 from Northfield, about three hours south, and
bought a sandy brown brick bungalow on two acres, with a
backyard forest included.</p>
              <p>Dobrow, who works as a herbalist and for a small company
that supports farmers, said they made the move with the future -
and growing worries about how climate change might affect them
- a top priority.</p>
              <p>""The number one criteria for me was access to freshwater.
I'm nervous about climate change. I wanted to be where - I mean
it's a little hokey - we could walk and have water,"" she said.</p>
              <p>Leaving their home of 16 years ""was hard,"" said Dobrow, 59.
""But we felt like we were being freed"" from ongoing worries
about where they would best be able to ride out climate change
impacts.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION</p>
              <p>Harvard's Keenan, an idiosyncratic bow tie wearer, first set
foot in Duluth in March - three months after he began fleshing
out why the quiet town of 86,000 might one day see tens of
thousands of new residents settle in.</p>
              <p>The professor and his team had identified Duluth after more
than 2,000 hours of work studying which U.S. towns might appeal
to tomorrow's climate migrants and have room for them.</p>
              <p>In Duluth's case, the attraction can partly be summed up in
an old real estate adage: Location, location, location, said
Keenan, an expert in climate adaptation and design.</p>
              <p>Duluth abuts the cooling breeze of Lake Superior - a big
source of freshwater - and is a reasonable 2.5-hour drive to a
dynamic economic hub, Minneapolis.</p>
              <p>The northern city's infamous cool weather means it will be
temperate when most of the country sweats in a world climate
experts say could be up to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees
Fahrenheit) hotter than preindustrial times as early as 2030.</p>
              <p>With its secure water supply, it is also less likely to face
some of the climate-driven threats other parts of the country
may grapple with, including worsening droughts and water
shortages.</p>
              <p>Other U.S. ""Rust Belt"" cities - which lost population as
heavy industry declined - also have been floated as potential
climate refuges, including New York state's Buffalo and
Cincinnati in Ohio.</p>
              <p>On a visit to the University of Minnesota Duluth in March,
Keenan offered a few sleek potential slogans for the city:
""Duluth - not as cold as you think"", ""The most climate-proof
city in America"", or ""Duluth: 99% climate-proof"".</p>
              <p>The social scientist was riffing off some of Duluth's own
marketing ideas from another era, when it tried to persuade
tourists that the lake-side city was worth a detour.</p>
              <p>Duluth's cool weather has long been the best draw for summer
tourists, said Tony Dierckins, a local historian.</p>
              <p>Vintage postcards tout the town as ""the air-conditioned
city"" and it was dubbed the country's ""hay fever haven"" until
the arrival of antihistamines blunted that appeal, Dierckins
said.</p>
              <p>The invention of air conditioning meant some residents of
Rust Belt cities such as Duluth eventually departed for warmer
destinations in the south of the United States, following jobs,
said David Woodward, a professor of history at UMD.</p>
              <p>As a result, Duluth represents a ""time capsule"" of sorts,

DULUTH, Minnesota, Oct 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -
B efore the advent of air conditioning, this northern U.S. city
on the shore of Lake Superior promoted itself as a cool summer
haven for the sweaty and allergy affected.
One day Duluth might offer another kind of relief: As a
haven for future U.S. migrants fleeing runaway heatwaves and
other extreme weather elsewhere in the country.
The Minnesota town, nestled along the world's largest
freshwater lake, is among a small group of cities that
scientists predict will become top destinations for Americans
abandoning parts of the country one day made inhospitable by
climate change.
Up to now, frigid winters in Duluth - often ranked one of
the coldest cities in the United States - have limited its
appeal. The city, planned to one day become as large as Chicago,
never quite achieved its aims, as vacant lots testify.
But Sandy Hoff, the president and owner of local real estate
development firm F.I. Salter, said a changing climate could spur
a property boom that would ""no doubt"" propel his company in ways
unseen since his grandfather acquired it 90 years ago.
""Duluth, in particular on the shore of the lake here, has
tended to be a little cooler maybe than people have wanted at
times in the past,"" he admitted.
""Maybe a little climate change, where we're getting a little
warmer, is beneficial to us,"" he said.

NO JOKE
Predictions that a wave of Americans could one day wash in
as a result of climate threats leave many residents part
intrigued, part skeptical.
Karen Pagel Guerndt, a realtor, joked that she hopes people
don't hear about Harvard professor Jesse Keenan's research
suggesting Duluth is well-situated to become a climate
sanctuary.
""We don't want to be a big city,"" she said.
She's kidding, of course, she said - after all, she sells
homes in Duluth for a living.
Some early climate migrants already are already buying them.
Angel Dobrow, her husband Bob and their dog arrived in
Duluth in 2017 from Northfield, about three hours south, and
bought a sandy brown brick bungalow on two acres, with a
backyard forest included.
Dobrow, who works as a herbalist and for a small company
that supports farmers, said they made the move with the future -
and growing worries about how climate change might affect them
- a top priority.
""The number one criteria for me was access to freshwater.
I'm nervous about climate change. I wanted to be where - I mean
it's a little hokey - we could walk and have water,"" she said.
Leaving their home of 16 years ""was hard,"" said Dobrow, 59.
""But we felt like we were being freed"" from ongoing worries
about where they would best be able to ride out climate change
impacts.

LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION
Harvard's Keenan, an idiosyncratic bow tie wearer, first set
foot in Duluth in March - three months after he began fleshing
out why the quiet town of 86,000 might one day see tens of
thousands of new residents settle in.
The professor and his team had identified Duluth after more
than 2,000 hours of work studying which U.S. towns might appeal
to tomorrow's climate migrants and have room for them.
In Duluth's case, the attraction can partly be summed up in
an old real estate adage: Location, location, location, said
Keenan, an expert in climate adaptation and design.
Duluth abuts the cooling breeze of Lake Superior - a big
source of freshwater - and is a reasonable 2.5-hour drive to a
dynamic economic hub, Minneapolis.
The northern city's infamous cool weather means it will be
temperate when most of the country sweats in a world climate
experts say could be up to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees
Fahrenheit) hotter than preindustrial times as early as 2030.
With its secure water supply, it is also less likely to face
some of the climate-driven threats other parts of the country
may grapple with, including worsening droughts and water
shortages.
Other U.S. ""Rust Belt"" cities - which lost population as
heavy industry declined - also have been floated as potential
climate refuges, including New York state's Buffalo and
Cincinnati in Ohio.
On a visit to the University of Minnesota Duluth in March,
Keenan offered a few sleek potential slogans for the city:
""Duluth - not as cold as you think"", ""The most climate-proof
city in America"", or ""Duluth: 99% climate-proof"".
The social scientist was riffing off some of Duluth's own
marketing ideas from another era, when it tried to persuade
tourists that the lake-side city was worth a detour.
Duluth's cool weather has long been the best draw for summer
tourists, said Tony Dierckins, a local historian.
Vintage postcards tout the town as ""the air-conditioned
city"" and it was dubbed the country's ""hay fever haven"" until
the arrival of antihistamines blunted that appeal, Dierckins
said.
The invention of air conditioning meant some residents of
Rust Belt cities such as Duluth eventually departed for warmer
destinations in the south of the United States, following jobs,
said David Woodward, a professor of history at UMD.
As a result, Duluth represents a ""time capsule"" of sorts,
with a population virtually unchanged in half a century,
Woodward said.
That means there is room for newcomers - but after decades
of a somewhat-depressed economy and no need for fresh housing,
many of Duluth's homes have aged. Some fear the city is not
ready for an influx.

SERENDIPITY
On Jefferson Street, amid chirping birds and bushy trees,
four neat houses speak to Duluth's housing crisis.
The Loaves and Fishes residences are for Duluth's homeless
residents, most of whom work but cannot afford the high rents
landlords typically charge, said Joel Kilgour, who volunteers at
the non-profit and chairs the Affordable Housing Coalition.
Rents have skyrocketed largely due to a housing shortage of
about 3,000 units. Local housing is shared with about 30,000
college students who need a home during the school year, said
UMD's Woodward.
Kilgour fears a surge of climate migrants could increase
pressures on housing, compounding an already ""serious internal
displacement crisis"" and creating a more unjust future for
current residents.
""If we as a community can't solve (current problems),
there's no way that we're going to be able to handle an influx
of climate refugees in an equitable manner,"" he said.
That conundrum is on the mind of many more Duluth residents
as well, including elected officials such as Mayor Emily Larson,
a former Loaves and Fishes volunteer.
In the heart of the Civic Center, Larson's stately office,
with ornate brass lamps hanging from the ceiling, acts as a
reminder that this mid-size city hall was intended for a ""big
city mayor"", she quipped.
If climate migration puts to better use Duluth's oversize
territory and infrastructure - there are 29% more road miles per
person here than in the similarly-sized Minnesota town of St.
Cloud, federal data shows - the result could be a kind of
""ironic serendipity,"" said Larson.
But she concedes she has ""trepidations"" about rapid future
growth.
""We struggle like many communities to ensure we have
economic opportunity and safety and housing,"" she said.
Preservationists such as Dennis Lamkin also fear for the
city's historic housing stock.
After developers build on the ample vacant and forested land
on the city's periphery to meet growing demand for homes,
continuing waves of climate migrants could prompt razing of the
city's myriad aging historic mansions to make room for
apartments, he worries.
Many mansions were erected during the city's heyday at the
turn of the last century, when more millionaires lived here than
anywhere else in the nation, thanks to thriving mining, lumber
and wheat industries.
""I would hate to see developers come into town, tear down
the historic architecture that we have, and just build
non-descript housing units to accomodate climate refugees,"" he
said.

FUTURES
Harvard's Keenan said after his presentation in March he
received at least two dozen emails from people who had recently
moved to Duluth with climate change in mind.
""Last October I bought a house in Duluth. It's my retirement
plan,"" said New Yorker Lacy Shelby by email. ""I needed ... a
lower 'dose' of noticeable climate change,"" she said.
Word is spreading among physicians too. At St. Luke's

              <p>SINGAPORE, Oct 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -
H omosexuality is banned in Singapore and arts are strictly
censored - yet performers say the tough line helps foment a
thriving, LGBT+ cultural scene in this conservative city state.</p>
              <p>Drag artists stage sellout shows at upmarket bars, gay
performance poets are in demand and singers use rap to come out.</p>
              <p>Gay sex remains illegal - even in private - but LGBT+
artists feel they now have a firm foothold in popular culture.</p>
              <p>The tiny island plays host to three LGBT+ arts festivals a
year and performers say their work stands in resistance to the
government as they weave past censors to reach a wider audience.</p>
              <p>""It is our way of pointing at the world we live in and
saying it's ridiculous and wrong,"" said drag queen Becca D'Bus,
whose shows attract a young, prosperous and professional crowd
in some of the city's busiest downtown bars.</p>
              <p>LGBT+ artists - creating everything from movies to music -
say state censorship, far from a deterrent, acts as a muse.</p>
              <p>""The harshness of the government ... increases the ingenuity
of artists in staging events without actually using words like
'queer' or 'gay',"" said poet and author Cyril Wong.</p>
              <p>""A word such as 'gender' is used instead.""</p>
              <p>Gay sex between men – though not women – is a crime in the
Southeast Asian city state, a state governed on strict lines and
conservative values.</p>
              <p>“In terms of laws, our rights for gay and bi men are bad.
Gay sex is still a jailable offence. This is worse than many
other neighbouring countries where gay sex is not illegal,” said
writer Ng Yi-Sheng. “But again, we haven't had crackdowns on gay
men such as in Malaysia and Indonesia.”</p>
              <p>Lawmakers are cautious on social reform, citing the rich
ethnic and religious mix in Singapore’s 5.6 million inhabitants.</p>
              <p>Activists are increasingly pushing back against the ban on
gay sex, aiming for change in the courts and an end to
discrimination across their young and modern society.</p>
              <p>“From theatre to performance and visual art exhibitions,
LGBT+ artists in Singapore have slowly carved out space and
pushed the comfort zone for dialogue around gay counterculture,”
said Tristan Cai, a Singaporean, who teaches art and Asian
studies at St. Mary’s College of Maryland in the United States.</p>
              <p>LGBT+ festivals such as Pink Dot, Queer Zinefest and Love
and Pride Film Festival have sprung up as a form of resistance
against state restrictions on LGBT+ art and culture.</p>
              <p>In July, popular musician Joshua Su came out to his parents
by releasing a new track on which he raps: ""G-A-Y-B-O-Y OK.""</p>
              <p>Academics say the high-profile arts scene helps the wider
push for LGBT+ rights.</p>
              <p>“The LGBTQ community has been working hard for inclusion and
against discrimination over the past decade....Their efforts
have contributed to a level of greater acceptance in Singapore
society,” says Ian Chong, associate professor in the department
of political science at National University of Singapore.</p>
              <p>The National Arts Council, a government funding body, said
art had ""the power to bring people in our diverse, multicultural
society together"" and reflected the many voices of Singapore.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>QUEERNESS</p>
              <p>""I talk a lot about queerness in my comedy, trying to debunk
myths and stereotypes people may have about me,"" 32-year-old
bisexual poet and stand-up comedian Stephanie Chan told the
Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p>Film-makers have learnt to use the internet to get round the
state censors of their LGBT+ output.</p>
              <p>""If we were to make a film to show in cinemas, we will have
to get a classification rating and some scenes may get cut,""
said filmmaker Leon Cheo.</p>
              <p>""Queer festivals make us feel less alone since social
discrimination never goes away,"" said 42-year-old poet and
author Cyril Wong, a winner of the Singapore Literature Prize.</p>
              <p>Yet Singapore has liberal credentials compared to some
countries in the region.</p>
              <p>Brunei sparked outcry this year over plans to impose the
death penalty for gay sex, then backtracked after intense global
criticism. In neighbouring Malaysia, the authorities caned two
women last year after they were convicted of same-sex relations.</p>
              <p>Popular opinion in Singapore appears divided.</p>
              <p>Last year, an Ipsos survey revealed 55% of Singaporeans
support the ban on gay sex. Yet a study by the Singapore-based
Institute of Policy Studies found six in 10 people aged 18-25
believe same-sex marriage is not wrong.</p>
              <p>Singapore's prime minister Lee Hsien Loong says his country
occupies a middle ground on LGBT+ rights.</p>
              <p>""We are not like San Francisco, neither are we like certain
countries in the Middle East,"" Lee told a conference in June.</p>
              <p>""It's something in between. It's the way this society is.""</p>
              <p/>
              <p>CENSORED</p>
              <p>All plays and public performances – including poetry
readings – must be screened and approved by the government's
Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA).</p>

SINGAPORE, Oct 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -
H omosexuality is banned in Singapore and arts are strictly
censored - yet performers say the tough line helps foment a
thriving, LGBT+ cultural scene in this conservative city state.
Drag artists stage sellout shows at upmarket bars, gay
performance poets are in demand and singers use rap to come out.
Gay sex remains illegal - even in private - but LGBT+
artists feel they now have a firm foothold in popular culture.
The tiny island plays host to three LGBT+ arts festivals a
year and performers say their work stands in resistance to the
government as they weave past censors to reach a wider audience.
""It is our way of pointing at the world we live in and
saying it's ridiculous and wrong,"" said drag queen Becca D'Bus,
whose shows attract a young, prosperous and professional crowd
in some of the city's busiest downtown bars.
LGBT+ artists - creating everything from movies to music -
say state censorship, far from a deterrent, acts as a muse.
""The harshness of the government ... increases the ingenuity
of artists in staging events without actually using words like
'queer' or 'gay',"" said poet and author Cyril Wong.
""A word such as 'gender' is used instead.""
Gay sex between men – though not women – is a crime in the
Southeast Asian city state, a state governed on strict lines and
conservative values.
“In terms of laws, our rights for gay and bi men are bad.
Gay sex is still a jailable offence. This is worse than many
other neighbouring countries where gay sex is not illegal,” said
writer Ng Yi-Sheng. “But again, we haven't had crackdowns on gay
men such as in Malaysia and Indonesia.”
Lawmakers are cautious on social reform, citing the rich
ethnic and religious mix in Singapore’s 5.6 million inhabitants.
Activists are increasingly pushing back against the ban on
gay sex, aiming for change in the courts and an end to
discrimination across their young and modern society.
“From theatre to performance and visual art exhibitions,
LGBT+ artists in Singapore have slowly carved out space and
pushed the comfort zone for dialogue around gay counterculture,”
said Tristan Cai, a Singaporean, who teaches art and Asian
studies at St. Mary’s College of Maryland in the United States.
LGBT+ festivals such as Pink Dot, Queer Zinefest and Love
and Pride Film Festival have sprung up as a form of resistance
against state restrictions on LGBT+ art and culture.
In July, popular musician Joshua Su came out to his parents
by releasing a new track on which he raps: ""G-A-Y-B-O-Y OK.""
Academics say the high-profile arts scene helps the wider
push for LGBT+ rights.
“The LGBTQ community has been working hard for inclusion and
against discrimination over the past decade....Their efforts
have contributed to a level of greater acceptance in Singapore
society,” says Ian Chong, associate professor in the department
of political science at National University of Singapore.
The National Arts Council, a government funding body, said
art had ""the power to bring people in our diverse, multicultural
society together"" and reflected the many voices of Singapore.

QUEERNESS
""I talk a lot about queerness in my comedy, trying to debunk
myths and stereotypes people may have about me,"" 32-year-old
bisexual poet and stand-up comedian Stephanie Chan told the
Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Film-makers have learnt to use the internet to get round the
state censors of their LGBT+ output.
""If we were to make a film to show in cinemas, we will have
to get a classification rating and some scenes may get cut,""
said filmmaker Leon Cheo.
""Queer festivals make us feel less alone since social
discrimination never goes away,"" said 42-year-old poet and
author Cyril Wong, a winner of the Singapore Literature Prize.
Yet Singapore has liberal credentials compared to some
countries in the region.
Brunei sparked outcry this year over plans to impose the
death penalty for gay sex, then backtracked after intense global
criticism. In neighbouring Malaysia, the authorities caned two
women last year after they were convicted of same-sex relations.
Popular opinion in Singapore appears divided.
Last year, an Ipsos survey revealed 55% of Singaporeans
support the ban on gay sex. Yet a study by the Singapore-based
Institute of Policy Studies found six in 10 people aged 18-25
believe same-sex marriage is not wrong.
Singapore's prime minister Lee Hsien Loong says his country
occupies a middle ground on LGBT+ rights.
""We are not like San Francisco, neither are we like certain
countries in the Middle East,"" Lee told a conference in June.
""It's something in between. It's the way this society is.""

CENSORED
All plays and public performances – including poetry
readings – must be screened and approved by the government's
Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA).
There are no official statistics on how much content is
banned each year and the IMDA declined to comment.
In 2007, Ng was banned from reading a short story at a Pride
event as it described a civil servant who turned gay after
reading a piece of erotica.
""I felt indignant and frustrated, but it was also funny. By
banning my story about a banned story, they were fulfilling this
image of Singapore as a censor-happy nation,” Ng said, noting
the irony of the government banning a story about censorship.
The National Arts Council (NAC) said it had regularly
supported Ng's projects.
Yet many gay artists and writers say their projects are
rejected by the NAC and complain of missing out on teaching
jobs at public universities.
A spokesman for the NAC said the body supported all artists
and arts groups ""according to our strategic priorities"".
The situation has improved immeasurably since the 1990s,
Wong said, when LGBT+ art was limited to independent galleries
or low-key informal events for fear of police persecution.
Now, there is more of a spirit of openness with local
companies sponsoring festivals since as PinkDot, he added.
""This freedom cannot be underestimated,"" Wong said.
Mainstream media, such as digital sites Today and Nylon
Magazine, also prominently feature drag queens, added D'Bus.
The other visible change is that people – from both the
straight and LGBT+ communities – flock to her shows.
""I find fun, glamour, frivolity, beauty and
pleasure productive,"" she said.
""They bring people together.""

              <p>PEACE OF MIND</p>
              <p>Halfway across the globe, Colombia's second city of Medellin
has a different model for fighting crime. Once Colombia's murder
capital, former no-go slums now boast open-air gyms, hillside
cable cars and community halls where youth orchestras play.</p>
              <p>In the past decade, city mayors have invested hundreds of
millions of dollars in social development projects and urban
renewal to help bridge the gap between rich and poor and reclaim
areas that were once controlled by gangs.</p>
              <p>There are fewer night-time gun battles since the death in
1993 of city drug lord Pablo Escobar, who ran the world's
largest cocaine cartel, though gang violence hotspots persist.</p>
              <p>Medellin's crime prevention approach focuses on finding
alternatives to keep teenagers off the streets and away from
gangs who - often with the nicest clothes, motorbikes and money
in their pockets from drug dealing - can easily lure them in.</p>
              <p>About 3,000 young people in Medellin belong to gangs or risk
being recruited, according to the mayor's office. Often armed
and fighting over turf, neighbourhood gangs control drug
trafficking and extortion and prostitution rackets.</p>
              <p>Six months ago, Johan Rodriguez received an unexpected knock
on the door from social workers at his home in a gang-ridden
Medellin hillside slum offering him work or training as part of
a new programme to keep vulnerable young people away from crime.</p>
              <p>""I was mixed up with the gangs then and I was consuming
drugs,"" said 25-year-old Rodriguez, one of nearly 1,000 young
people aged between 10 and 28 taking part in the ""Parceros"" or
""Mates"" project, which city hall launched last year.</p>
              <p>It offers support to go back to school, get job interviews
and set up small businesses, from textile to DJ companies, as
well as activities that help young people make friends across
the invisible borders that divide gang territory.</p>
              <p>""While the violence is always there, the project showed me
there's something else around the corner, another way. It opened
up my eyes,"" said Rodriguez, who works in a motorbike factory
after social workers sent his CV to employers across the city.</p>
              <p>""What I liked the most is that it taught me if you were
violent, you felt powerful on the street. But I learned that a
person is powerful when they have a peace of mind inside and are
happy with themselves.""</p>
              <p>The programme includes yoga, breathing exercises to deal
with anger, and challenges including diving into a swimming pool
covered with ice and walking over hot coals.</p>
              <p>""The point of the exercises is to show us that we can
achieve goals and overcome our fears,"" Rodriguez said.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>SUCCESS STORIES</p>
              <p>Colombia and South Africa are both highly unequal countries
struggling to find ways to move on from violent pasts and reduce
widespread corruption and unemployment.</p>
              <p>Community projects like the 'i was shot in joburg :)' shop,
which sells photos taken by homeless children at risk of drugs
and gang violence, seek to provide alternatives to crime.</p>
              <p>In Pheko's Diepsloot township, 30 km north of Sandown where
he works, people pay 20 rand ($1.30) a month for community-run
patrols.</p>
              <p>""We see projects come and go if they are functioning in
isolation,"" said Stewart Barret, director of Navan Consulting,
which analyses future trends in South Africa, calling for better
trained police, more jobs and well-functioning schools.</p>
              <p>Security innovations like Vumacam and Aura - a mobile
platform which summons armed responders - are looking to work
more closely with the police.</p>
              <p>""We know that without the improvement of social and economic
issues in the country, we are simply repeatedly filling a broken
cup,"" said Warren Myers, founder of Aura.</p>
              <p>The police are working on a pilot project with private
security companies, said police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu
Naidoo, declining to give more details due to confidentiality.</p>
              <p>""The South African Police Service welcomes and encourages
the involvement of private security in the fight against crime,""
he said. ""They complement our efforts.""</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, South Africans are doing whatever they can to
feel safer, said Jason Mordecai, managing director of 7Arrows.</p>
              <p>""People are building their own camera surveillance with
equipment bought online. They are using Whatapp groups to share
information,"" he said.</p>
              <p>""The irony is that sometimes the security walls become so
high that you never speak to your neighbours. We become more and
more anonymous to one another as we try to hide from crime.""</p>
              <p>Back in Sandown, Pheko hit the accelerator as an alarm went
off in a nearby house. As he leapt out of his car, his radio
buzzed.</p>
              <p>""False alarm,"" he said, adjusting his gun to continue his
daily patrol.</p>

in their pockets from drug dealing - can easily lure them in.
About 3,000 young people in Medellin belong to gangs or risk
being recruited, according to the mayor's office. Often armed
and fighting over turf, neighbourhood gangs control drug
trafficking and extortion and prostitution rackets.
Six months ago, Johan Rodriguez received an unexpected knock
on the door from social workers at his home in a gang-ridden
Medellin hillside slum offering him work or training as part of
a new programme to keep vulnerable young people away from crime.
""I was mixed up with the gangs then and I was consuming
drugs,"" said 25-year-old Rodriguez, one of nearly 1,000 young
people aged between 10 and 28 taking part in the ""Parceros"" or
""Mates"" project, which city hall launched last year.
It offers support to go back to school, get job interviews
and set up small businesses, from textile to DJ companies, as
well as activities that help young people make friends across
the invisible borders that divide gang territory.
""While the violence is always there, the project showed me
there's something else around the corner, another way. It opened
up my eyes,"" said Rodriguez, who works in a motorbike factory
after social workers sent his CV to employers across the city.
""What I liked the most is that it taught me if you were
violent, you felt powerful on the street. But I learned that a
person is powerful when they have a peace of mind inside and are
happy with themselves.""
The programme includes yoga, breathing exercises to deal
with anger, and challenges including diving into a swimming pool
covered with ice and walking over hot coals.
""The point of the exercises is to show us that we can
achieve goals and overcome our fears,"" Rodriguez said.

SUCCESS STORIES
Colombia and South Africa are both highly unequal countries
struggling to find ways to move on from violent pasts and reduce
widespread corruption and unemployment.
Community projects like the 'i was shot in joburg :)' shop,
which sells photos taken by homeless children at risk of drugs
and gang violence, seek to provide alternatives to crime.
In Pheko's Diepsloot township, 30 km north of Sandown where
he works, people pay 20 rand ($1.30) a month for community-run
patrols.
""We see projects come and go if they are functioning in
isolation,"" said Stewart Barret, director of Navan Consulting,
which analyses future trends in South Africa, calling for better
trained police, more jobs and well-functioning schools.
Security innovations like Vumacam and Aura - a mobile
platform which summons armed responders - are looking to work
more closely with the police.
""We know that without the improvement of social and economic
issues in the country, we are simply repeatedly filling a broken
cup,"" said Warren Myers, founder of Aura.
The police are working on a pilot project with private
security companies, said police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu
Naidoo, declining to give more details due to confidentiality.
""The South African Police Service welcomes and encourages
the involvement of private security in the fight against crime,""
he said. ""They complement our efforts.""
Meanwhile, South Africans are doing whatever they can to
feel safer, said Jason Mordecai, managing director of 7Arrows.
""People are building their own camera surveillance with
equipment bought online. They are using Whatapp groups to share
information,"" he said.
""The irony is that sometimes the security walls become so
high that you never speak to your neighbours. We become more and
more anonymous to one another as we try to hide from crime.""
Back in Sandown, Pheko hit the accelerator as an alarm went
off in a nearby house. As he leapt out of his car, his radio
buzzed.
""False alarm,"" he said, adjusting his gun to continue his
daily patrol.

              <p>LONDON, Oct 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Driverless
transport, underground shops, heated bike paths, armed street
patrols – this is not the setting for a dystopian novel but it
could soon be the city where you live.</p>
              <p>As the world sees the biggest wave of urban growth in
history – with almost 70% of its population expected to be
living in urban areas by 2050, up from 56% today – the task of
making cities greener and safer is becoming more urgent.</p>
              <p>That cities are attracting more people is nothing new, noted
urban specialist Philipp Rode, who runs London-based research
centre LSE Cities.</p>
              <p>""People move to cities to live and work because they're a
solution: they significantly reduce the amount of movement and
space required to do anything,"" he told the Thomson Reuters
Foundation.</p>
              <p>""But the absolute increase in population, the millions
coming into cities - that's unprecedented.""</p>
              <p>The shift is creating significant challenges for many cities
already at risk from worsening climate change and rising
inequality, with the race on to house swelling populations and
tackle homelessness.</p>
              <p>To cope with these modern-day pressures, cities around the
world are trying to become ""smarter"" - from moving storage and
retail facilities underground, to using data and technology to
improve security, healthcare and mobility.</p>
              <p>Many cities, particularly in poorer nations, are also facing
large and expanding slum populations which lack basic services,
fueling inequality, and, in some cases, violence.</p>
              <p>Mandy Pienaar, a 43-year-old media executive from
Johannesburg, knows this only too well.</p>
              <p>One winter evening, as she and her boyfriend drove home from
the movies in the South African city, two armed assailants
hijacked their car, stripped them of their clothing and stole
their bank cards before the couple managed to escape.</p>
              <p>""It was quite shocking because there were a lot of people
walking past who kind of looked at me as if this was an everyday
occurrence, to see a stripped woman sitting in a slum area in
the cold,"" Pienaar recalled.</p>
              <p>Their ordeal illustrates the ""false sense of security"" that
comes with living as they do in a gated community, she said.</p>
              <p>""We have bars on every window, huge dogs, electric fencing
... to us that's normal. We've become desensitised.""</p>
              <p>Community-led projects like ""vuvuzela patrols"" aim to tackle
such violence, with groups of men armed with plastic trumpets
escorting women on their daily commutes in Johannesburg.</p>
              <p>But security is not the only worry on urban planners' minds.</p>
              <p>From the small U.S. city of Duluth to the metropolis of Hong
Kong, cities are thrashing out ways to reinvent themselves and
revamp how their residents live, move and consume.</p>
              <p>""Mobility, water, waste: the world's greatest challenges are
solved in cities,"" said Tiina Kaho, head of the Helsinki
Metropolitan Smart &amp; Clean Foundation, a coalition of
businesses, researchers and state officials.</p>
              <p>Yet as the world transforms rapidly, ""cities will have to
innovate like never before"", she said.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>GOING UNDERGROUND</p>
              <p>From Singapore to sub-Saharan Africa, cities are running out
of space to house swelling populations.</p>
              <p>""It's a scarce resource,"" said Rode. ""Using that space in
the most efficient way possible is crucial.""</p>
              <p>Historically cities have tended to grow outwards rather than
upwards, according to a report published by the World Resources
Institute and Yale University in January.</p>
              <p>But, if uncontrolled, such expansion can make it challenging
to deliver basic services, with trips to school or the doctor
becoming longer, for example. At the same time, it eats into
farmland and can threaten green areas and biodiversity.</p>
              <p>To be sustainable, cities will need to temper their sprawl
with efforts to increase density, researchers said.</p>
              <p>In Britain, for example, the government announced plans to
build hundreds of thousands of new rural homes along its 'Green
Belt' - protected areas in the English countryside.</p>
              <p>For other cities, increasing density will mean putting more
facilities below ground - not just subway networks and utilities
but commercial, retail and storage facilities too.</p>
              <p>In Hong Kong, known for its towering skyscrapers and wooded
hills, there is a particular urgency to maximise use of
underground space, with home and land prices among the world's
highest.</p>
              <p>The government has vowed to free more space for housing
through measures like building artificial islands.</p>
              <p>It is also looking to use underground spaces for waste
treatment, data centres, water reservoirs, power stations,
crematoriums and sports facilities.</p>
              <p>""For the city, it results in more efficient use of space ...
and avoids the conflicts of traffic and weather disruptions
above ground,"" said Mark Wallace, director of infrastructure at
Arup, a consultancy that studied underground space in Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>Other cities have also gone underground, with Finland's
capital Helsinki moving sports facilities and emergency shelters
below the surface. Canada's Montreal, meanwhile, has a wide
pedestrian network of shops and hotels beneath its streets.</p>
              <p>In December billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk unveiled a
1.14-mile (1.8 km) tunnel in the Los Angeles area that was dug
with new fast, low-cost technology, as a first step to
developing a high-speed subterranean network for vehicles.</p>
              <p>While excavating and building underground is more expensive,
there are savings in maintenance and land costs, Wallace said.</p>
              <p>But underground living is no replacement for better land-use
planning, researchers warned, while residents worry construction
and access to buried facilities will eat into green space above.</p>
              <p>Euan Mills, urban design and planning lead at Future Cities
Catapult, a UK-funded innovation centre, said cities should
""accommodate nature, but not at the expense of density"".</p>
              <p>For him, the answer lies in building skywards.</p>
              <p>""Human bodies need daylight, so going underground won't
work,"" he said.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>SAFE CITIES</p>
              <p>As cities seek space to grow, they must also consider how
their development affects social equality, said Rode of LSE
Cities.</p>
              <p>""In fast-expanding cities the differences between rich and
poor increase,"" he said.</p>
              <p>Neighbourhoods tend to display income disparities, leaving
some with better access to services, and leading to what Rode
called ""anti-urban gestures"" such as gated communities.</p>
              <p>In South Africa, the legacy of apartheid-era city planning
and rapid urban population growth have contributed to making it
the most unequal country by income, according to the World Bank.</p>
              <p>South Africa's cities remain for the most part racially
divided more than 20 years after the end of apartheid, under
which millions of black people were forcibly removed from
white-only urban areas to live in crowded townships and
homelands, with buffer zones separating the races.</p>
              <p>Those patterns of inequality can stoke grievances, according
to urban analysts, with South Africa – which has one of the
world's highest murder rates – in July deploying the army to
quell a surge in violence in gang-infested parts of Cape Town.</p>
              <p>That has led to a proliferation of private security firms,
such as safety start-up Aura, which created a mobile platform
allowing customers to access a network of armed emergency
services.</p>
              <p>""The police are stretched thin,"" said Warren Myers, founder
of Aura, which has received about 25 panic alerts a day from its
70,000 users since its launch in 2017.</p>
              <p>""We need to marry as many different technologies as possible
- CCTV, facial recognition, data collection, WhatsApp groups -
to better protect South Africans,"" he added.</p>
              <p>But private security is hardly sufficient to tackle crime,
analysts warned, as realised by cities in Latin America where
drug-fuelled murder rates are among the world's highest.</p>
              <p>After decades of heavy-handed police tactics in cities in
Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela and parts of Central
America, new methods of tackling crime are gaining currency,
with a stronger focus on social development projects.</p>
              <p>In Colombia's second city of Medellin, this approach has
focused on urban renewal in slums: once-neglected shanty
districts now boast landscaped parks, open-air gyms, schools,
playgrounds and community halls where youth orchestras play.</p>
              <p>""Sustained investment in deprived areas ... combined with
increased community policing and recreational alternatives, like
after-school programmes, have seemed to turn the dial in
reducing homicide rates,"" said Robert Muggah, co-founder of the
Igarape Institute, a Brazil-based think-tank.</p>
              <p>After the death of cocaine drug-lord Pablo Escobar in 1993,
Medellin's murder rate plunged more than 90% from 266 per
100,000 people in 1991 to 19 per 100,000 in 2018.</p>
              <p>Medellin resident Johan Rodriguez, 25, decided to retire
from gang life after taking part in a six-month programme to
keep vulnerable people away from crime.</p>
              <p>The ""Parceros"" (""Mates"") project, launched last year by city
hall, helps teenagers go back to school, get job interviews and
set up small businesses, from textiles to DJing.</p>
              <p>""While the violence is always there, the project showed me
there's something else around the corner, another way,"" said
Rodriguez, who now works in a motorbike factory after social
workers sent out his CV to employers across the city.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>CLIMATE HAVENS</p>
              <p>Yet as record numbers of people move into cities, some urban
areas are facing uncertainty over the future as climate change
brings worsening threats, from extreme heat to flooding.</p>
              <p>One fifth of the world's major cities will experience
unprecedented climate conditions by 2050, such as more intense
dry and monsoon seasons, according to the Crowther Lab, a
Swiss-based research group.</p>
              <p>Researchers predict that as wild weather becomes more
frequent, it could force millions of people to move out of
harm's way, with some unable to return.</p>
              <p>From Indonesia's sinking capital of Jakarta to the Middle
East's sweltering cities, that poses a new kind of challenge for
urban planners, Rode said.</p>
              <p>""Cities have faced numerous events like wars or earthquakes
when populations had to be evacuated, but the idea had always
been to return and rebuild,"" he said.</p>
              <p>In response to the threats, some U.S. cities - such as
Minnesota's Duluth - are studying efforts to become top
destinations for Americans abandoning parts of the country that
may one day be made inhospitable by climate change.</p>
              <p>Angel Dobrow, 59, who works for a small firm that supports
farmers, and her husband have already made the move to lakefront
Duluth, leaving their longtime home in another part of Minnesota
in 2017.</p>
              <p>""As a person concerned with climate change, being near
freshwater and having a little bit of land to grow food and grow
herbs was critical for me,"" said Dobrow, sitting in her lush
garden in the northern city.</p>
              <p>Duluth, located by the world's largest freshwater lake, may
not seem the most obvious choice as a haven for climate
migrants.</p>
              <p>With its frigid winters, the metropolis is often ranked as
one of the coldest cities in the United States.</p>
              <p>But Sandy Hoff, the president and owner of local real estate
development firm F.I. Salter, said a changing climate could spur
a property boom that would ""no doubt"" propel his company in ways
unseen since his grandfather acquired it 90 years ago.</p>
              <p>Dobrow said when summer heat and humidity burden other areas
of Minnesota, Duluth's lakefront breezes ""feel like air
conditioning"".</p>
              <p>But some fear an influx of new residents could exacerbate a
housing crisis in a city where few new homes have been built.</p>
              <p>Joel Kilgour, who chairs Duluth's Affordable Housing
Coalition and volunteers at housing non-profit Loaves and
Fishes, said the city's homeless are forced to seek rooms at the
charity as they cannot afford rising rents.</p>
              <p>""If we as a community can't solve that, there's no way that
we're going to be able to handle an influx of climate refugees
in an equitable manner,"" Kilgour said.</p>
              <p>Potential climate refuge cities may also struggle to build
costly infrastructure, such as water treatment plants and energy
utilities, without a sufficient tax base ahead of time to pay
for them, researchers warned.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>SMART CITIES?</p>
              <p>To try to thrive amid rapid urbanisation and worsening
climate change threats, many cities around the world are trying
to become ""smarter"".</p>
              <p>From heated bike paths to melt snow in Toronto to high-tech
sensors that detect when Barcelona's bins need emptying,
governments are pooling resources from citizens and businesses
to make cities more efficient, sustainable and livable.</p>
              <p>Many of those efforts focus on improving mobility in cities,
with urban planners looking at innovative ways to cut both
traffic and climate-warming emissions.</p>
              <p>Dubai - which, according to the Roads and Transport
Authority (RTA), has more than one vehicle for every two people
- is experimenting with driverless mobility pods that aim to
combine the comfort of ride-hailing services like Uber with the
efficiency and capacity of buses.</p>
              <p>The cube-shaped vehicles, built by U.S.-based NEXT Future
Transportation Inc., can carry up to 10 people each and dock
together when in motion, allowing passengers to move from one
unit to the other using the front and rear doors.</p>
              <p>The vehicles – which should enter mass production at the end
of 2020 – are designed to pick up single users at home, then
pool people going in the same direction inside one module, as
other pods are released to collect more passengers.</p>
              <p>""It's like a relay race,"" said founder Tommaso Gecchelin.</p>
              <p>Rode of LSE Cities said it was important one inefficient car
system should not be replaced with another, adding autonomous
vehicles should carry as many passengers as possible.</p>
              <p>Allowing private self-driving cars could result in empty
vehicles ""just driving around waiting for their owners"", taking
up public space needlessly, he warned.</p>
              <p>Other major smart city initiatives have run into delays or
unexpected problems, sparking criticism.</p>
              <p>Kenya's planned Konza Technopolis – a new $14.5 billion city
to be built about 60 km (37 miles) southeast of crowded Nairobi
– has fallen behind schedule on its goal of accommodating 20,000
people by 2020, according to Nairobi-based entrepreneurs and
analysts.</p>
              <p>Dubbed the Silicon Savannah, Konza aims to become a modern
tech hub but the first building has yet to be completed due to
red tape and a lack of funding, critics noted.</p>
              <p>Lavasa - the first city in India's $7.5 billion plan to turn
100 urban centres into Smart Cities by 2020 - has suffered from
design issues, and ignored the needs of poor and marginalised
groups, planners and rights groups have said.</p>
              <p>""Urban planners, not cities, are the ones who need to get
smarter,"" said Mills of Future Cities Catapult, calling for more
investment in data collection and training of city planners.</p>
              <p>""Google knows more about our cities than planning
departments do.""</p>
              <p/>
              <p>SLOWER CITIES?</p>
              <p>Even as some cities become smarter and more efficient, calls
also are mounting to slow the frantic pace of urban life.</p>
              <p>Efforts range from the literal – with many cities pushing
for lower speed limits on their roads — to the imaginative,
including art installations to promote mindfulness.</p>
              <p>On a recent ""sound walk"" in the English town of Reading, a
dozen residents, including a retired historian and teenage
students, strolled silently through parks, graveyards and
bookstores.</p>
              <p>Led by sound artist Richard Bentley, the group uploaded
photos and audio recordings from their phones to Hush City, an
app that maps quiet areas in cities.</p>
              <p>With noise pollution the most common cause of environmental
complaints in Europe, according to the European Commission, and
more people crowding into urban areas, Bentley expects peace and
quiet could become a ""commodified luxury"".</p>
              <p>Historically, poorer groups lower down the social ladder
have had to live in noisy parts of cities while those with more
means could move away, he said.</p>
              <p>""It's incredibly important to keep these quiet spaces and to
be aware of their possible disappearance,"" he added.</p>
              <p>Some places are jumping on the livability bandwagon through
Cittaslow, which means ""slow city"" in Italian.</p>
              <p>The global network of more than 260 cities grades its
members according to factors such as sustainable infrastructure,
promotion of local economies, fairness and ""good living"".</p>
              <p>South Korean member Jeonju, a city of about 650,000 people,
has planted millions of trees and runs monthly car-free zones

LONDON, Oct 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Driverless
transport, underground shops, heated bike paths, armed street
patrols – this is not the setting for a dystopian novel but it
could soon be the city where you live.
As the world sees the biggest wave of urban growth in
history – with almost 70% of its population expected to be
living in urban areas by 2050, up from 56% today – the task of
making cities greener and safer is becoming more urgent.
That cities are attracting more people is nothing new, noted
urban specialist Philipp Rode, who runs London-based research
centre LSE Cities.
""People move to cities to live and work because they're a
solution: they significantly reduce the amount of movement and
space required to do anything,"" he told the Thomson Reuters
Foundation.
""But the absolute increase in population, the millions
coming into cities - that's unprecedented.""
The shift is creating significant challenges for many cities
already at risk from worsening climate change and rising
inequality, with the race on to house swelling populations and
tackle homelessness.
To cope with these modern-day pressures, cities around the
world are trying to become ""smarter"" - from moving storage and
retail facilities underground, to using data and technology to
improve security, healthcare and mobility.
Many cities, particularly in poorer nations, are also facing
large and expanding slum populations which lack basic services,
fueling inequality, and, in some cases, violence.
Mandy Pienaar, a 43-year-old media executive from
Johannesburg, knows this only too well.
One winter evening, as she and her boyfriend drove home from
the movies in the South African city, two armed assailants
hijacked their car, stripped them of their clothing and stole
their bank cards before the couple managed to escape.
""It was quite shocking because there were a lot of people
walking past who kind of looked at me as if this was an everyday
occurrence, to see a stripped woman sitting in a slum area in
the cold,"" Pienaar recalled.
Their ordeal illustrates the ""false sense of security"" that
comes with living as they do in a gated community, she said.
""We have bars on every window, huge dogs, electric fencing
... to us that's normal. We've become desensitised.""
Community-led projects like ""vuvuzela patrols"" aim to tackle
such violence, with groups of men armed with plastic trumpets
escorting women on their daily commutes in Johannesburg.
But security is not the only worry on urban planners' minds.
From the small U.S. city of Duluth to the metropolis of Hong
Kong, cities are thrashing out ways to reinvent themselves and
revamp how their residents live, move and consume.
""Mobility, water, waste: the world's greatest challenges are
solved in cities,"" said Tiina Kaho, head of the Helsinki
Metropolitan Smart & Clean Foundation, a coalition of
businesses, researchers and state officials.
Yet as the world transforms rapidly, ""cities will have to
innovate like never before"", she said.

GOING UNDERGROUND
From Singapore to sub-Saharan Africa, cities are running out
of space to house swelling populations.
""It's a scarce resource,"" said Rode. ""Using that space in
the most efficient way possible is crucial.""
Historically cities have tended to grow outwards rather than
upwards, according to a report published by the World Resources
Institute and Yale University in January.
But, if uncontrolled, such expansion can make it challenging
to deliver basic services, with trips to school or the doctor
becoming longer, for example. At the same time, it eats into
farmland and can threaten green areas and biodiversity.
To be sustainable, cities will need to temper their sprawl
with efforts to increase density, researchers said.
In Britain, for example, the government announced plans to
build hundreds of thousands of new rural homes along its 'Green
Belt' - protected areas in the English countryside.
For other cities, increasing density will mean putting more
facilities below ground - not just subway networks and utilities
but commercial, retail and storage facilities too.
In Hong Kong, known for its towering skyscrapers and wooded
hills, there is a particular urgency to maximise use of
underground space, with home and land prices among the world's
highest.
The government has vowed to free more space for housing
through measures like building artificial islands.
It is also looking to use underground spaces for waste
treatment, data centres, water reservoirs, power stations,
crematoriums and sports facilities.
""For the city, it results in more efficient use of space ...
and avoids the conflicts of traffic and weather disruptions
above ground,"" said Mark Wallace, director of infrastructure at
Arup, a consultancy that studied underground space in Hong Kong.
Other cities have also gone underground, with Finland's
capital Helsinki moving sports facilities and emergency shelters
below the surface. Canada's Montreal, meanwhile, has a wide
pedestrian network of shops and hotels beneath its streets.
In December billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk unveiled a
1.14-mile (1.8 km) tunnel in the Los Angeles area that was dug
with new fast, low-cost technology, as a first step to
developing a high-speed subterranean network for vehicles.
While excavating and building underground is more expensive,
there are savings in maintenance and land costs, Wallace said.
But underground living is no replacement for better land-use
planning, researchers warned, while residents worry construction
and access to buried facilities will eat into green space above.
Euan Mills, urban design and planning lead at Future Cities
Catapult, a UK-funded innovation centre, said cities should
""accommodate nature, but not at the expense of density"".
For him, the answer lies in building skywards.
""Human bodies need daylight, so going underground won't
work,"" he said.

SAFE CITIES
As cities seek space to grow, they must also consider how
their development affects social equality, said Rode of LSE
Cities.
""In fast-expanding cities the differences between rich and
poor increase,"" he said.
Neighbourhoods tend to display income disparities, leaving
some with better access to services, and leading to what Rode
called ""anti-urban gestures"" such as gated communities.
In South Africa, the legacy of apartheid-era city planning
and rapid urban population growth have contributed to making it
the most unequal country by income, according to the World Bank.
South Africa's cities remain for the most part racially
divided more than 20 years after the end of apartheid, under
which millions of black people were forcibly removed from
white-only urban areas to live in crowded townships and
homelands, with buffer zones separating the races.
Those patterns of inequality can stoke grievances, according
to urban analysts, with South Africa – which has one of the
world's highest murder rates – in July deploying the army to
quell a surge in violence in gang-infested parts of Cape Town.
That has led to a proliferation of private security firms,
such as safety start-up Aura, which created a mobile platform
allowing customers to access a network of armed emergency
services.
""The police are stretched thin,"" said Warren Myers, founder
of Aura, which has received about 25 panic alerts a day from its
70,000 users since its launch in 2017.
""We need to marry as many different technologies as possible
- CCTV, facial recognition, data collection, WhatsApp groups -
to better protect South Africans,"" he added.
But private security is hardly sufficient to tackle crime,
analysts warned, as realised by cities in Latin America where
drug-fuelled murder rates are among the world's highest.
After decades of heavy-handed police tactics in cities in
Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela and parts of Central
America, new methods of tackling crime are gaining currency,
with a stronger focus on social development projects.
In Colombia's second city of Medellin, this approach has
focused on urban renewal in slums: once-neglected shanty
districts now boast landscaped parks, open-air gyms, schools,
playgrounds and community halls where youth orchestras play.
""Sustained investment in deprived areas ... combined with
increased community policing and recreational alternatives, like
after-school programmes, have seemed to turn the dial in
reducing homicide rates,"" said Robert Muggah, co-founder of the
Igarape Institute, a Brazil-based think-tank.
After the death of cocaine drug-lord Pablo Escobar in 1993,
Medellin's murder rate plunged more than 90% from 266 per
100,000 people in 1991 to 19 per 100,000 in 2018.
Medellin resident Johan Rodriguez, 25, decided to retire
from gang life after taking part in a six-month programme to
keep vulnerable people away from crime.
The ""Parceros"" (""Mates"") project, launched last year by city
hall, helps teenagers go back to school, get job interviews and
set up small businesses, from textiles to DJing.
""While the violence is always there, the project showed me
there's something else around the corner, another way,"" said
Rodriguez, who now works in a motorbike factory after social
workers sent out his CV to employers across the city.

CLIMATE HAVENS
Yet as record numbers of people move into cities, some urban
areas are facing uncertainty over the future as climate change
brings worsening threats, from extreme heat to flooding.
One fifth of the world's major cities will experience
unprecedented climate conditions by 2050, such as more intense
dry and monsoon seasons, according to the Crowther Lab, a
Swiss-based research group.
Researchers predict that as wild weather becomes more
frequent, it could force millions of people to move out of
harm's way, with some unable to return.
From Indonesia's sinking capital of Jakarta to the Middle
East's sweltering cities, that poses a new kind of challenge for
urban planners, Rode said.
""Cities have faced numerous events like wars or earthquakes
when populations had to be evacuated, but the idea had always
been to return and rebuild,"" he said.
In response to the threats, some U.S. cities - such as
Minnesota's Duluth - are studying efforts to become top
destinations for Americans abandoning parts of the country that
may one day be made inhospitable by climate change.
Angel Dobrow, 59, who works for a small firm that supports
farmers, and her husband have already made the move to lakefront
Duluth, leaving their longtime home in another part of Minnesota
in 2017.
""As a person concerned with climate change, being near
freshwater and having a little bit of land to grow food and grow
herbs was critical for me,"" said Dobrow, sitting in her lush
garden in the northern city.
Duluth, located by the world's largest freshwater lake, may
not seem the most obvious choice as a haven for climate
migrants.
With its frigid winters, the metropolis is often ranked as
one of the coldest cities in the United States.
But Sandy Hoff, the president and owner of local real estate
development firm F.I. Salter, said a changing climate could spur
a property boom that would ""no doubt"" propel his company in ways
unseen since his grandfather acquired it 90 years ago.
Dobrow said when summer heat and humidity burden other areas
of Minnesota, Duluth's lakefront breezes ""feel like air
conditioning"".
But some fear an influx of new residents could exacerbate a
housing crisis in a city where few new homes have been built.
Joel Kilgour, who chairs Duluth's Affordable Housing
Coalition and volunteers at housing non-profit Loaves and
Fishes, said the city's homeless are forced to seek rooms at the
charity as they cannot afford rising rents.
""If we as a community can't solve that, there's no way that
we're going to be able to handle an influx of climate refugees
in an equitable manner,"" Kilgour said.
Potential climate refuge cities may also struggle to build
costly infrastructure, such as water treatment plants and energy
utilities, without a sufficient tax base ahead of time to pay
for them, researchers warned.

SMART CITIES?
To try to thrive amid rapid urbanisation and worsening
climate change threats, many cities around the world are trying
to become ""smarter"".
From heated bike paths to melt snow in Toronto to high-tech
sensors that detect when Barcelona's bins need emptying,
governments are pooling resources from citizens and businesses
to make cities more efficient, sustainable and livable.
Many of those efforts focus on improving mobility in cities,
with urban planners looking at innovative ways to cut both
traffic and climate-warming emissions.
Dubai - which, according to the Roads and Transport
Authority (RTA), has more than one vehicle for every two people
- is experimenting with driverless mobility pods that aim to
combine the comfort of ride-hailing services like Uber with the
efficiency and capacity of buses.
The cube-shaped vehicles, built by U.S.-based NEXT Future
Transportation Inc., can carry up to 10 people each and dock
together when in motion, allowing passengers to move from one
unit to the other using the front and rear doors.
The vehicles – which should enter mass production at the end
of 2020 – are designed to pick up single users at home, then
pool people going in the same direction inside one module, as
other pods are released to collect more passengers.
""It's like a relay race,"" said founder Tommaso Gecchelin.
Rode of LSE Cities said it was important one inefficient car
system should not be replaced with another, adding autonomous
vehicles should carry as many passengers as possible.
Allowing private self-driving cars could result in empty
vehicles ""just driving around waiting for their owners"", taking
up public space needlessly, he warned.
Other major smart city initiatives have run into delays or
unexpected problems, sparking criticism.
Kenya's planned Konza Technopolis – a new $14.5 billion city
to be built about 60 km (37 miles) southeast of crowded Nairobi
– has fallen behind schedule on its goal of accommodating 20,000
people by 2020, according to Nairobi-based entrepreneurs and
analysts.
Dubbed the Silicon Savannah, Konza aims to become a modern
tech hub but the first building has yet to be completed due to
red tape and a lack of funding, critics noted.
Lavasa - the first city in India's $7.5 billion plan to turn
100 urban centres into Smart Cities by 2020 - has suffered from
design issues, and ignored the needs of poor and marginalised
groups, planners and rights groups have said.
""Urban planners, not cities, are the ones who need to get
smarter,"" said Mills of Future Cities Catapult, calling for more
investment in data collection and training of city planners.
""Google knows more about our cities than planning
departments do.""

SLOWER CITIES?
Even as some cities become smarter and more efficient, calls
also are mounting to slow the frantic pace of urban life.
Efforts range from the literal – with many cities pushing
for lower speed limits on their roads — to the imaginative,
including art installations to promote mindfulness.
On a recent ""sound walk"" in the English town of Reading, a
dozen residents, including a retired historian and teenage
students, strolled silently through parks, graveyards and
bookstores.
Led by sound artist Richard Bentley, the group uploaded
photos and audio recordings from their phones to Hush City, an
app that maps quiet areas in cities.
With noise pollution the most common cause of environmental
complaints in Europe, according to the European Commission, and
more people crowding into urban areas, Bentley expects peace and
quiet could become a ""commodified luxury"".
Historically, poorer groups lower down the social ladder
have had to live in noisy parts of cities while those with more
means could move away, he said.
""It's incredibly important to keep these quiet spaces and to
be aware of their possible disappearance,"" he added.
Some places are jumping on the livability bandwagon through
Cittaslow, which means ""slow city"" in Italian.
The global network of more than 260 cities grades its
members according to factors such as sustainable infrastructure,
promotion of local economies, fairness and ""good living"".
South Korean member Jeonju, a city of about 650,000 people,
has planted millions of trees and runs monthly car-free zones
since joining in 2016, Mayor Seung-Su Kim said by email.
Pier Giorgio Oliveti, the network's secretary general, said
the approach could be a ""vaccine"" for the ills of modernity.
But Mills of Future Cities Catapult argued that ""one of the
most exciting things about cities is how alive they are"".
""I don't think we should be slowing them down,"" he added.
Now, more than ever, urban planners and government should
""reflect on what cities are for"", advised LSE Cities' Rode.
""Why are cities such attractive places for living and
working? Because they bring people together to enjoy public
life,"" he said.
""That real, physical experience needs to be preserved.""

cities are planned without people in mind, you get more informal

land-based planning, and plan around people and their needs.""</p>
              <p>From Bangkok to Manila, as Asian cities strive to become
more modern, street vendors and hawkers are viewed increasingly
as a hindrance to city planning and are being evicted from

              <p>But public spaces are for the good of all members of the
public and must be legally available to everyone, said
Chidchanok Samantrakul at WIEGO, a global non-profit that helps
informal workers.</p>
              <p>""Half the city is informal - informal settlers, street
vendors - yet planners only focus on the formal. But there has
to be opportunity for everyone to co-exist,"" she said.</p>
              <p>Several cities in the region are now using Minecraft, a

But increasingly, planners are ignoring the poorest and most
vulnerable residents including slum dwellers and street vendors,
said Renu Khosla, director of the Centre for Urban & Regional
Excellence in New Delhi.
""Our cities are not being planned for the poor. But when
cities are planned without people in mind, you get more informal
settlements, you get more inequality,"" she told the Thomson
Reuters Foundation.
""Perhaps it's time to move away from territorial and
land-based planning, and plan around people and their needs.""
From Bangkok to Manila, as Asian cities strive to become
more modern, street vendors and hawkers are viewed increasingly
as a hindrance to city planning and are being evicted from
pavements.
But public spaces are for the good of all members of the
public and must be legally available to everyone, said
Chidchanok Samantrakul at WIEGO, a global non-profit that helps
informal workers.
""Half the city is informal - informal settlers, street
vendors - yet planners only focus on the formal. But there has
to be opportunity for everyone to co-exist,"" she said.
Several cities in the region are now using Minecraft, a
video game that allows players to build their own worlds using
virtual Lego-like pieces, to get communities to participate in
upgrading their common spaces, under a UN-Habitat programme.
In the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi, where women and girls
often face harassment on the streets and on public transport,
Minecraft was used to identify safety issues and make public
spaces safer, said Thu Dao Thi Bao of non-profit Plan
International.
""Technology helps give girls and women a voice. We have to
encourage their participation in city planning and management.""

              <p>LONDON, Oct 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Thousands of
homeless people and minority groups in Britain could be blocked
from voting in national elections if government plans requiring
voters to show photo identification go ahead, civil society
groups warned on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The proposal requiring all citizens to present photo ID to
vote were outlined by Queen Elizabeth on Monday during the
so-called Queen's Speech, which sees the politically-neutral
monarch set out the government's annual agenda.</p>
              <p>The plans, if approved into law, would come into effect
ahead of the next scheduled general election in 2022 in a bid to
stop electoral fraud, a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said, but the
move has sparked concerns about disenfranchisement.</p>
              <p>""These plans are set to leave tens of thousands of
legitimate voters voiceless and hit some groups much harder than
others,"" said Jess Garland, director at the Electoral Reform
Society, a campaign group promoting democracy and voter rights.</p>
              <p>""There remains no evidence of widespread impersonation at
the ballot box yet the government continues to cynically pursue
this 'show your papers' policy knowing full well the potential
impact across the country.""</p>
              <p>About 45 million people voted in the last general election
in 2017 with one conviction of fraud, according to Britain's
Electoral Commission, an independent regulatory body.</p>
              <p>The Cabinet Office spokeswomen said Northern Ireland voters
had shown photo ID at polling stations since 2003 and successful
trials took place in five UK local authorities in 2018.</p>
              <p>""Electoral fraud is an unacceptable crime that strikes at a
core principle of our democracy. Showing ID to vote is a
reasonable and proportionate way to protect our elections,"" the
Cabinet Office spokeswoman said in a statement.</p>
              <p>Any voter who does not have an approved form of ID, such as
a passport or driving licence, will be able to apply, free of
charge, for a local electoral ID from their local authority,
according to government plans.</p>
              <p>About 3.5 million people in Britain had none of these types
of photo ID, according to a 2015 Electoral Commission report.</p>
              <p>Civil rights groups, including the Salvation Army,  homeless
charity Centrepoint and Liberty, last year issued a letter
warning compulsory voter ID would disproportionately impact the
homeless, those without a permanent address, and Black, Asian
and Minority Ethnic groups (BAME).</p>
              <p>Clare Collier, advocacy director at civil rights group
Liberty, said the risk of electoral fraud was being used as an
excuse for greater surveillance of the British public.</p>
              <p>The reforms are now subject to debate by parliament,
concluding with a vote for approval next week.</p>
              <p>""Voter ID is likely to damage election turnout and will
worst affect those who are already disadvantaged - including
young people, older people, disabled, transgender, BAME
communities and homeless people,"" she said.</p>

had shown photo ID at polling stations since 2003 and successful
trials took place in five UK local authorities in 2018.
""Electoral fraud is an unacceptable crime that strikes at a
core principle of our democracy. Showing ID to vote is a
reasonable and proportionate way to protect our elections,"" the
Cabinet Office spokeswoman said in a statement.
Any voter who does not have an approved form of ID, such as
a passport or driving licence, will be able to apply, free of
charge, for a local electoral ID from their local authority,
according to government plans.
About 3.5 million people in Britain had none of these types
of photo ID, according to a 2015 Electoral Commission report.
Civil rights groups, including the Salvation Army,  homeless
charity Centrepoint and Liberty, last year issued a letter
warning compulsory voter ID would disproportionately impact the
homeless, those without a permanent address, and Black, Asian
and Minority Ethnic groups (BAME).
Clare Collier, advocacy director at civil rights group
Liberty, said the risk of electoral fraud was being used as an
excuse for greater surveillance of the British public.
The reforms are now subject to debate by parliament,
concluding with a vote for approval next week.
""Voter ID is likely to damage election turnout and will
worst affect those who are already disadvantaged - including
young people, older people, disabled, transgender, BAME
communities and homeless people,"" she said.

LONDON, Oct 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Gay and

              <p>NEW DELHI, Oct 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Shoved,
cursed and ridiculed, Nisha's hospital visits were always
stressful as a transgender woman and got worse after she was
diagnosed as HIV-positive.</p>
              <p>But a new app introduced as part of a drive to end an HIV
epidemic in India by 2030 is providing her and the transgender
community better access to doctors, lifesaving drugs - and hope
- although it has raised concerns about digital privacy.</p>
              <p>India has the world's third largest population living with
HIV - 2.1 million people - according to UNAIDS, with recognition
that help is needed in the transgender community where the
prevalence is 3.1% compared to 0.26% among all adults.</p>
              <p>Nisha tested HIV positive last year after earning a living
as a sex worker in New Delhi. On the job, she said, condoms
would often break or she would not use one for more money.</p>
              <p>""That was a bad idea. I ended up with HIV. I felt suicidal
after I found out,"" Nisha, 29, a trans woman who goes by one
name, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p>""It didn't help that going to the hospital was torturous.
People made faces, passed lewd comments ... a doctor even kicked
me out.""</p>
              <p>Despite the Supreme Court recognising India's 2 million
transgender people as a third gender with equal rights in 2014,
they are often kicked out by their families and denied jobs,
education and healthcare, leading them to begging or sex work.</p>
              <p>Trans women like Nisha say they face ""double discrimination""
and the risk of being shunned and abused - first because of
their gender identity and then because of their HIV status.</p>
              <p>But a counselling programme along with a new app is helping
health workers track down HIV-positive transgender people,
monitor their treatment and link them to doctors and
antiretroviral therapy (ART) to suppress the AIDS virus.</p>
              <p>""I have found new strength. I don't feel depressed or
nervous anymore,"" said Nisha, who now begs at traffic lights.</p>
              <p>""The app helps keep me physically healthy and she ensures
I'm mentally and emotionally (healthy),"" she said, pointing to
her outreach worker Samyra, an HIV-positive trans woman.</p>
              <p>The eMpower app - developed by IBM in partnership with India
HIV/AIDS Alliance and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria - monitored more than 1.2 million
people between January 2018 and March 2019.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>'HALF THE BATTLE WON'</p>
              <p>With mobile tablets in hand, HIV-positive transgender
outreach workers keep a tab on others in their community living
with HIV and counsel them and accompany them to see doctors.</p>
              <p>""I tell them 'I'm like you. I'm HIV-positive and I'm taking
medicines too. You're not alone',"" said Samyra, who works with
Vihaan, a national initiative to expand counselling, outreach
and follow-up programmes to people living with HIV.</p>
              <p>""That makes a huge difference because it's coming from one
of your own. Half of the HIV battle is won when you have someone
to hold your hand along the way.""</p>
              <p>Health experts said transgender focused initiatives like
this and the launch in March of India's first HIV treatment
clinic in Mumbai city run for and by LGBT+ people were pushing
the country towards its target to end the epidemic by 2030.</p>
              <p>But to achieve this target they said it was critical for
patients to stick with ART. Sometimes stigma and side effects
can cause them to drop out of the treatment.</p>
              <p>That is why health workers follow up with clients every few
months and record information on the eMpower app, including
their weight, viral load and CD4 - white blood cells that fight
HIV - and advise them on everything from their diet to safe sex.</p>
              <p>They also note whether a client has faced discrimination,
and arrange for partners and family members to get tested.</p>
              <p>Sonal Mehta, head of India HIV/AIDS Alliance, said the app
has helped boost Vihaan's outreach numbers as well as the
confidence of trans clients and workers, who often come from
poor, semi-literate backgrounds.</p>
              <p>""The trans clients definitely feel much more secure ... but
the outreach workers themselves also feel very empowered. They
are professional officers working on the field, talking to
doctors, government officers, engaging with various
organisations,"" she said.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD</p>
              <p>While such technological advances are seen as key in the
HIV/AIDS fight, health and software experts warn they can come
at the cost of privacy.</p>
              <p>The eMpower app creates a profile for each client with
personal information including name, biometric ID number,
occupation and monthly income, and a map pinning their location.</p>
              <p>Without proper safeguards, such an app runs the risk of data
breach and sharing information with third-parties, which can
further ostracise an already marginalised community, said Ambika
Tandon, a cyber security expert.</p>
              <p>""The potential to monetise is definitely a risk factor,""
said Tandon, policy officer in gender-based research at the
Banaglore-based Centre for Internet and Society.</p>
              <p>""Another is informational privacy ... (clients) may not
necessarily know where their information is being stored, who
will have access to it ... There could be multiple points at
which their data could be vulnerable.""</p>
              <p>Saravanan RM, a senior technical officer at India HIV/AIDS
Alliance, said the eMpower app a ""fool-proof system"".</p>
              <p>He said all sensitive data was stored on the organisation's
server, which could only be accessed by specific workers through
a password-protected system.</p>
              <p>None of the information can be seen by any partners - not
IBM, state or federal governments. It is further beefed up by a
mobile device management (MDM), he said.</p>
              <p>""For example, if any device is lost or has gone into someone
else's hands, what we can do through MDM is clean out the entire
tablet and the data will not be acquired,"" he said.</p>
              <p>Dr. V Sam Prasad, India programme manager of the AIDS
Healthcare Foundation, said the app should not be dismissed
because there was a privacy risk as it came with major benefits.</p>
              <p>Several HIV-positive transgender people like Swati, a trans
woman who contracted HIV after injecting drugs, felt the same.</p>
              <p>""Even if it (personal data) is leaked, what's the worst that
could happen? I've faced unimaginable things. Nothing scares me,
at least not such things,"" said Swati, 25, after a follow-up

              <p>""It is (eMpower) saving me. It is not an enemy.""</p>

""Even if it (personal data) is leaked, what's the worst that
could happen? I've faced unimaginable things. Nothing scares me,
at least not such things,"" said Swati, 25, after a follow-up
meeting with her outreach worker at her one-room home.
""It is (eMpower) saving me. It is not an enemy.""

              <p>""Women have men in their lives and when men are not allowed,
it's hard for women to build a life there,"" said Robinson, 57.</p>
              <p>To find new residents, SuBAMUH opened up to all and in 2018,
two couples moved there - one lesbian and the other a man and

              <p>BANGKOK, Oct 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Human
traffickers in Thailand have ignored court orders to compensate
victims in more than 99% of cases in recent years, fuelling
fears that many survivors could be re-trafficked, data obtained
exclusively by the Thomson Reuters Foundation revealed.</p>
              <p>Thai courts have ordered traffickers to pay their victims
more than 130 million baht ($4.3 million) for damages caused in
about 1,335 cases since 2014, according to the latest available
statistics from the Office of the Attorney General.</p>
              <p>But the money was only paid in five cases, with survivors
receiving a total of 5.6 million baht - excluding cases settled
out of court - found data from the government's anti-trafficking
department, obtained via Thailand's freedom of information law.</p>
              <p>Although Thailand has rescued a record-breaking 1,000-plus
trafficking victims this year, campaigners are concerned that
the failure to pay compensation will leave them in fresh danger.</p>
              <p>""It's an important issue that is unfortunately being
neglected,"" said Chonticha Tangworamongkon, a program director
at the Human Rights and Development Foundation, which provides
free legal aid to migrant workers and trafficking victims.</p>
              <p>""This money will enable (victims) to start a new life and
prevent them from being re-trafficked, but the government's role
in assisting victims in pursuing the claims is still not clear.""</p>
              <p>Thailand is considering amending its 1999 anti-money
laundering law to allow offenders' assets seized by the
Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO) to be used to compensate
victims.</p>
              <p>Four public hearings were held this year to discuss the
legal amendment - seized assets are currently state property -
but it is unclear when it will be reviewed by the cabinet.</p>
              <p>Thailand is home to about 610,000 modern slaves - about one
in 113 of its 69 million people - according to the Global
Slavery Index by the rights group Walk Free Foundation.</p>
              <p>The United States called on Thailand in June to increase
compensation to victims in its annual Trafficking in Persons
(TIP) report - which ranked it as a Tier 2 country - meaning it
is making significant efforts to combat the crime.</p>
              <p>Trafficking victims are automatically compensated through a
government fund - which provides living and rehabilitation
expenses and lost wages - but Tangworamongkon said these sums of
money were not sufficient for victims to rebuild their lives.</p>
              <p>While Thai law allows victims to claim compensation from
convicted traffickers, offenders have refused to pay in more
than 1,000 cases - for which there is no legal punishment.</p>
              <p>The law requires the Ministry of Social Development and
Human Security to assist victims in enforcing their compensation
claims, yet anti-trafficking charities and campaigners say it
has failed to ensure that fines are collected from offenders.</p>
              <p>But pursuing claims is a complex process, which involves
tracing offenders' assets and bringing in the Legal Execution
Department - which enforces court orders - to seize them.</p>
              <p>Ratchapon Maneelek, a director at Thailand's
anti-trafficking department, which falls under the social
ministry, said several government agencies had been holding
meetings to determine the extent of their legal powers to
enforce claims.</p>
              <p>""This is something new for us that we may not have
expertise in,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>NO MONEY, NO PAY</p>
              <p>Aged nine, Bo Soe's mother took him from Myanmar to Thailand
in 2013, where he was forced by a trafficker to sell roses.</p>
              <p>For five years, Bo Soe and about 10 other children were
forced to tout to tourists in a backpacker district in Bangkok
from 6 p.m. to 5 a.m. without pay, eating only one meal a day.</p>
              <p>""It was very horrible and I was scared. Whenever I couldn't
sell all (the roses), I would be beaten,"" the 15-year-old told
the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Thailand's western
region of Mae Sot, where he lives with his grandmother and aunt.</p>
              <p>In May, judges upheld a lower court ruling convicting a man
and woman of trafficking, jailing them for 12 years. They were
then ordered to pay 1.26 million baht in compensation to Bo Soe.</p>
              <p>""I don't know whether or not I will receive the money ...

BANGKOK, Oct 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Human
traffickers in Thailand have ignored court orders to compensate
victims in more than 99% of cases in recent years, fuelling
fears that many survivors could be re-trafficked, data obtained
exclusively by the Thomson Reuters Foundation revealed.
Thai courts have ordered traffickers to pay their victims
more than 130 million baht ($4.3 million) for damages caused in
about 1,335 cases since 2014, according to the latest available
statistics from the Office of the Attorney General.
But the money was only paid in five cases, with survivors
receiving a total of 5.6 million baht - excluding cases settled
out of court - found data from the government's anti-trafficking
department, obtained via Thailand's freedom of information law.
Although Thailand has rescued a record-breaking 1,000-plus
trafficking victims this year, campaigners are concerned that
the failure to pay compensation will leave them in fresh danger.
""It's an important issue that is unfortunately being
neglected,"" said Chonticha Tangworamongkon, a program director
at the Human Rights and Development Foundation, which provides
free legal aid to migrant workers and trafficking victims.
""This money will enable (victims) to start a new life and
prevent them from being re-trafficked, but the government's role
in assisting victims in pursuing the claims is still not clear.""
Thailand is considering amending its 1999 anti-money
laundering law to allow offenders' assets seized by the
Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO) to be used to compensate
victims.
Four public hearings were held this year to discuss the
legal amendment - seized assets are currently state property -
but it is unclear when it will be reviewed by the cabinet.
Thailand is home to about 610,000 modern slaves - about one
in 113 of its 69 million people - according to the Global
Slavery Index by the rights group Walk Free Foundation.
The United States called on Thailand in June to increase
compensation to victims in its annual Trafficking in Persons
(TIP) report - which ranked it as a Tier 2 country - meaning it
is making significant efforts to combat the crime.
Trafficking victims are automatically compensated through a
government fund - which provides living and rehabilitation
expenses and lost wages - but Tangworamongkon said these sums of
money were not sufficient for victims to rebuild their lives.
While Thai law allows victims to claim compensation from
convicted traffickers, offenders have refused to pay in more
than 1,000 cases - for which there is no legal punishment.
The law requires the Ministry of Social Development and
Human Security to assist victims in enforcing their compensation
claims, yet anti-trafficking charities and campaigners say it
has failed to ensure that fines are collected from offenders.
But pursuing claims is a complex process, which involves
tracing offenders' assets and bringing in the Legal Execution
Department - which enforces court orders - to seize them.
Ratchapon Maneelek, a director at Thailand's
anti-trafficking department, which falls under the social
ministry, said several government agencies had been holding
meetings to determine the extent of their legal powers to
enforce claims.
""This is something new for us that we may not have
expertise in,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

NO MONEY, NO PAY
Aged nine, Bo Soe's mother took him from Myanmar to Thailand
in 2013, where he was forced by a trafficker to sell roses.
For five years, Bo Soe and about 10 other children were
forced to tout to tourists in a backpacker district in Bangkok
from 6 p.m. to 5 a.m. without pay, eating only one meal a day.
""It was very horrible and I was scared. Whenever I couldn't
sell all (the roses), I would be beaten,"" the 15-year-old told
the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Thailand's western
region of Mae Sot, where he lives with his grandmother and aunt.
In May, judges upheld a lower court ruling convicting a man
and woman of trafficking, jailing them for 12 years. They were
then ordered to pay 1.26 million baht in compensation to Bo Soe.
""I don't know whether or not I will receive the money ...
but I'm happy to be back with my family,"" said Bo Soe, whose
name has been changed to protect his identity as a minor.
Papop Siamhan, a lawyer who has followed the case, said Bo
Soe was unlikely to ever receive the money, since the
traffickers could not afford the compensation, and the long
prison sentence meant they would not be able to gather the cash.
Lawyers and charities, which are often hired by trafficking
victims to trace offenders' assets and enforce compensation
orders, say seizures by AMLO can actually thwart survivors'
efforts to obtain restitution.
""If it's a case involving the fishing sector, for instance,
AMLO will seize the vessels and freeze the bank accounts of
offenders,"" said Siamhan. ""(This) means the victims' lawyer will
have to track down other assets.""

""OUR LIVES ARE CHEAP""
Sugunya Rattananakintr, a public prosecutor who focuses on
human trafficking cases, said court rules should be amended to
require offenders who were ordered to pay compensation to do so
before they were allowed to appeal their sentences and fines.
""The problem is the enforcement of compensation orders since
the ministry doesn't have knowledge in this area,"" she said.
""If you wait until the case reaches the highest court, the
offenders will transfer all their assets, leaving them with
nothing left to pay (in compensation to victims).""
Maneelek from the anti-trafficking division said the
Ministry of Social Development and Human Security and other
related government agencies signed an agreement last year to
help victims with their cases and track down offenders' assets.
""We are in the process of looking for ways to cooperate
(within government), which might take some time,"" he said.
However, time is not a luxury that many victims can afford.
Having been trafficked at 22 and forced to work on a fishing
boat for three years without pay, Aung Aung was hopeful when the
six traffickers were jailed for 10 years in July and ordered to
pay about 2 million baht in compensation to their victims.
But Aung Aung does not know when he will receive the 65,000

again in southern Thailand despite knowing the risks involved.
""It was like hell, working so hard ... for more than three

""I hope I will get the compensation money some day.""

A 2017 survey found that more than half of British women had
suffered sexual harassment while at a place of work or study,
ranging from inappropriate comments to sexual assault.
""#MeToo has helped place a public spotlight on how
widespread sexual harassment is in the workplace,"" said
Alexandra Patsalides, a human rights lawyer at women's rights
group Equality Now.
""Employers must send a clear message that sexual misconduct
is never acceptable and effective policies need to be
implemented that address predatory sexual misbehaviour and hold
perpetrators fully to account,"" she said.

              <p>By Tom Allard</p>
              <p>BANGKOK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - He is Asia’s most-wanted man. He
is protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private
jet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night
at a Macau casino.</p>
              <p>Tse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected
of leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate
formed out of an alliance of five of Asia’s triad groups,
according to law enforcement officials. Its members call it
simply “The Company.” Police, in a nod to one of Tse’s
nicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for “Brother Number
Three.”</p>
              <p>The syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of
methamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen
countries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South
Pacific. But meth – a highly addictive drug with devastating
physical and mental effects on long-term users – is its main
business, they say.</p>
              <p>In what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate’s
meth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be
as high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the
cartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a
40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has
expanded at least fourfold in the past five years.</p>
              <p>This unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an
unprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the
prime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously
unreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the
Australian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about
20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far
the biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug
trafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in
the investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar,
China, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan,
while not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the
investigation.</p>
              <p>A document containing AFP profiles of the operation’s top 19
syndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the
leader of the syndicate. According to the document, the
organization has “been connected with or directly involved in at
least 13 cases” of drug trafficking since January 2015. The
document does not provide specific details of the cases.</p>
              <p>A Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the
“Multinational CEO” of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional
government agencies says Tse is “believed to be” the leader of
the Sam Gor syndicate.</p>
              <p>Police have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected
boss of the trafficking group.</p>
              <p>Some investigators say that the scope of the syndicate’s
operation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin
America’s most legendary narco-traffickers. “Tse Chi Lop is in
the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,” said Jeremy
Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC.
“The word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no
doubt it applies here.”</p>
              <p>Reuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to
questions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan’s Ministry
of Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on
investigations.</p>
              <p>During the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific
to uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This
included interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement
officials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence
reports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings
and other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in
Myanmar’s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia’s Golden
Triangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing
drugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited
the Thai compound of one of the syndicate’s alleged drug lords.</p>
              <p>What emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly
transnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the
AFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often
refer to as “T1” - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong,
Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.</p>
              <p>The syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and
sophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin
American cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies
a bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a
more diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels
do, including Japan’s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic
Chinese gangs across Southeast Asia.</p>
              <p>The crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled
outbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police
say. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked
rivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a
united pursuit of gargantuan profits.</p>
              <p>“The crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate
with seamless efficiency,” says one veteran Western anti-drugs
official. “They function like a global corporation.”</p>
              <p>Like most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed,
the investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
              <p>In addition to the contrasts between their drug operations,
there’s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop
and Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed
Mexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine
trafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their
extravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has
been revealed about Tse’s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug
lords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>A TRIP, A TRAP</p>
              <p>Tse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern
China, and grew up during China’s Cultural Revolution. Amid the
bloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group
of imprisoned members of Mao’s Red Guard in the southern city of
Guangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big
Circle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police,
and like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong
Kong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their
criminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.</p>
              <p>In the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong,
Macau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based
in Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling
ring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless
opium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand,
China and Laos meet.</p>
              <p>In 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on
drug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New
York. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into
America, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over
his head.</p>
              <p>Through a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged
for leniency.</p>
              <p>His ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His
12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed.
If freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed
“great sorrow” for his crime, court records show.</p>
              <p>The entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to
nine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional
institution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.</p>
              <p>After he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to
Canada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for
the next four years. It’s unclear when Tse returned to his old
haunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife
registered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company
Ltd, in Hong Kong in 2011.</p>
              <p>Police suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He
“picked up where he left off,” said the senior AFP investigator.
Tse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and
the Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved
irresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his
drug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no
extra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.</p>
              <p>His policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for
business, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011,
AFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and
meth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather
than arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under
surveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely
for more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug
cell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They
wanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.</p>
              <p>The syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other
drug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and
selling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the
syndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the
Melbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police
watched the Australian meet two men.</p>
              <p>One of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted
hair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese
family man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance
showed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal
security. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of
Thai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eight
worked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as
part of his security protocol.</p>
              <p>Tse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts
and five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in
private jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand
for a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt,
according to a member of the task force investigating the
syndicate.</p>
              <p>Tse was a frequent visitor to Asia’s casinos and fond of
betting on horses, especially on English races. “We believe he
lost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the
tables in Macau,” said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.</p>
              <p>As the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected
that the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia
with meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA,
commonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the
Sam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say,
when a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of
white powder strapped to each of his thighs.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>‘ALADDIN’S CAVE OF INTEL’</p>
              <p>Cai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the
airport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It
was the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous,
picking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said
a former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation.
“His hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,” the
commander told Reuters. “Methamphetamine is very toxic.”</p>
              <p>Cai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs
was a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful
tranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. “We were very
fortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,” the
commander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been
monitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police
had no idea who he was.</p>
              <p>Cai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a
“pesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,” according to
Myanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A
friend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father.
Cai’s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for
ketamine at the airport, the commander said.</p>
              <p>Unimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight.
The next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport.
One recognized him from surveillance work he’d been conducting.</p>
              <p>Still, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they
later found on one of his phones might have explained his
silence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least
three assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch
and electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said
one investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy
saying “Loyalty to the Heavens.” The banner was a “triad-related
sign,” he added.</p>
              <p>The tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed
the video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat
because he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a
law enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of
the victim’s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad
members were sending a message about the price of disloyalty,
the officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.</p>
              <p>The torture videos were just one of the items allegedly
found in Cai’s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was
a diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate’s activities, but
sloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones,
police say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media
conversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.</p>
              <p>They were “an Aladdin’s Cave of intel,” said one AFP
commander based in North Asia.</p>
              <p>For at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly
travelled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for
the syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the
Drug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its
investigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip
from an international courier company recording the delivery of
two consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf
Chinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea
packets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had
been cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
              <p>Two days after Cai’s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon
address, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That
evening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon
jetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so,
Myanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but
other than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate,
including couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.</p>
              <p>Then came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery
of photos and videos on Cai’s phones, an AFP investigator based
in Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing
he had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier.
“This one stuck out because it was Canadian,” he recalled. “I
said: ‘Fuck, I know who you are!'”</p>
              <p>It was Tse Chi Lop.</p>
              <p>The Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of
intelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work
on Cai’s phones.</p>
              <p>Australia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime
gangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade,
the AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and
small, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent
described the database, which includes a trove of names,
chemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and
surveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence
on Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.</p>
              <p>The AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai’s
phones with the database. They discovered photos related to
three big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in
China, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators
and Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese
anti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and
addresses in Cai’s phones to other meth busts in China.</p>
              <p>For regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations
upended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by
different crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the
work of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics
agent said they believed Cai was “one of the members of a
mega-syndicate,” which had been involved in multiple “drugs
cases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.”</p>
              <p>Cai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still
in jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking
charges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to
contact Cai’s lawyer.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>METH PARADISE</p>
              <p>During his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing
the country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and
obtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a
bigger vessel in international waters, according to police and
the Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures
of the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where
the meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.</p>
              <p>The police reconstruction of Cai’s dealings in Myanmar led
to another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production
had shifted from China’s southern provinces to Shan State in
Myanmar’s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had
provided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor
ingredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were
smuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in
the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the
freedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.</p>
              <p>Armed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan
State have long controlled large tracts of territory and used
drug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the
military. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar
government with rebel groups over the years has brought relative
calm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to
flourish.</p>
              <p>“Production facilities can be hidden from law enforcement
and other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,”
analyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the
International Crisis Group. “Drug production and profits are now
so vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.”</p>
              <p>The Myanmar government and police did not respond to
questions from Reuters.</p>
              <p>Along the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there
is evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts
a deep ravine known as the “Valley of Death,” where ethnic
Kachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for
decades with Myanmar’s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past
trucks carrying building materials and workers.</p>
              <p>The Kaung Kha militia’s immaculate and expansive new
headquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green
hills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers
away, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved
out of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned
out vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba
tablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine.
When it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more
than 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg
of caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances
used in drug production.</p>
              <p>The Loikan facility was “very likely” to have been the
source of much of the Sam Gor syndicate’s meth, said the
Yangon-based AFP officer.</p>
              <p>“Some militia were involved in the lab,” said Oi Khun, a
communications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia,
in an interview. He paused, then added: “But not with the
knowledge of senior members” of the militia.</p>
              <p>One person in Loikan described how workers from the lab
would come down from the hills. The men, like most of the
villagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the
locals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.</p>
              <p>“I asked them once. ‘Why don’t you bathe?’” the person said.
“They said they did, but there was nothing they could do about
the smell.”</p>
              <p>The rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the
skin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature
stench might reveal their illicit activities. “We all knew,” the
person said. “We just didn’t talk about it. That just brings you
danger.”</p>
              <p>Meth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals,
say Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network’s
couriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the
Asia-Pacific.</p>
              <p>Shan’s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the
world, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told
Reuters. “They can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the
ground and let it dry.”</p>
              <p>The UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth
is worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business
model for meth is “very different” to heroin, said the UNODC’s
Douglas. “Inputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not
needed, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore
far, far higher.”</p>
              <p>The wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in
northeastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a
UNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control
Commission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to
the UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand,
$298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the
Japanese market, that’s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.</p>
              <p>The money the syndicate is making “means that if they lose
ten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,”
said the Chinese counter-narcotics official. “They can afford
failure. It doesn’t matter.”</p>
              <p/>
              <p>‘MONEY, MONEY’</p>
              <p>The analysis of Cai’s phones was continuing to provide
leads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the
pick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with
Myanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at
sea for weeks.</p>
              <p>One of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the
Shun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement
document reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea
when, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a
marine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and
paid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV
Valkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s
and hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea
sickness tablets. According to local media, he didn’t have a
fishing license at the time.</p>
              <p>After buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on
a course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in
the Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the
rendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western
Australian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was
seen “unloading a lot of packages” into a van, the commander
said.</p>
              <p>“We knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of
organized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and
comes back with some gear on it, that it hasn’t just dropped
from the sky in the middle of the ocean.”</p>
              <p>Investigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car
hire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug
traffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say,
that some of Smith’s alleged co-conspirators were members of an
ethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and
Comanchero motorcycle gangs, known as “bikies” in Australia.</p>
              <p>As they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of
crystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor
syndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy
of an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians
reconvened in Perth a month later.</p>
              <p>Bikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and
a self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had
refined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star
hotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police
investigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants,
said the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar &amp; Grill in Perth.
The restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that
included caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.</p>
              <p>On November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again,
this time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the
Andaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth
from Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast
of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the
Indian Ocean.</p>
              <p>The Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.</p>
              <p>When the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in
international waters off the West Australian coast on December
19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting “money, money,”
according to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De
Man’s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith
and his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved
their identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by
the crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.</p>
              <p>The Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of
Geraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The
men unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of
the AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault
weapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty
to importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of
his alleged associates are still on trial.</p>
              <p>Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it
had “worked together with our counterparts on the investigation”
of the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the “substantial
seizure of illicit narcotics” by the Australian authorities in
December 2017. The bureau said it was “aware that Taiwanese
syndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in
(the) Asia-Pacific region,” and was working “collaboratively and
closely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and
cross-border drug trafficking.”</p>
              <p/>
              <p>NIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED</p>
              <p>As the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police
concluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone
a kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the
three biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the
1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The
other two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse’s original triad, and the
Bamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator,
the syndicate’s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that
it “must rival Apple’s.”</p>
              <p>“The syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market
to tap,” said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior
colonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade.
“The power this network possesses is unimaginable.”</p>
              <p>Investigators have had wins. In February last year, police
busted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough
tea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66
was intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than
one tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor
lieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar.
In December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected
syndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.</p>
              <p>Located near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed
compound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used
to experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a
100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to
the back of the property.</p>
              <p>Sue wasn’t there, but property and money from 38 bank
accounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized
during the investigation. Sue is still at large.</p>
              <p>But the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the
wider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal
meth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and
Southeast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in
most countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising
seizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019,
“suggested the supply of the drug had expanded.”</p>
              <p>In the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive
adversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug
motherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product
in shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth
coming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the
syndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This
included deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each
containing about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on
narrow jungle paths.</p>
              <p>Over the years, police have had little success in taking
down Asia’s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders
have been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to
the AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics
kingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than
a short period was in the mid-1970s. That’s when Ng Sik-ho, a
wily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced
to 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium
and morphine, according to court records.</p>
              <p>So far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho’s fate. He is being
tracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say
counter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they
believe he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.</p>

BANGKOK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - He is Asia’s most-wanted man. He
is protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private
jet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night
at a Macau casino.
Tse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected
of leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate
formed out of an alliance of five of Asia’s triad groups,
according to law enforcement officials. Its members call it
simply “The Company.” Police, in a nod to one of Tse’s
nicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for “Brother Number
Three.”
The syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of
methamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen
countries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South
Pacific. But meth – a highly addictive drug with devastating
physical and mental effects on long-term users – is its main
business, they say.
In what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate’s
meth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be
as high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the
cartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a
40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has
expanded at least fourfold in the past five years.
This unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an
unprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the
prime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously
unreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the
Australian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about
20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far
the biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug
trafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in
the investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar,
China, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan,
while not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the
investigation.
A document containing AFP profiles of the operation’s top 19
syndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the
leader of the syndicate. According to the document, the
organization has “been connected with or directly involved in at
least 13 cases” of drug trafficking since January 2015. The
document does not provide specific details of the cases.
A Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the
“Multinational CEO” of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional
government agencies says Tse is “believed to be” the leader of
the Sam Gor syndicate.
Police have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected
boss of the trafficking group.
Some investigators say that the scope of the syndicate’s
operation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin
America’s most legendary narco-traffickers. “Tse Chi Lop is in
the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,” said Jeremy
Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC.
“The word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no
doubt it applies here.”
Reuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to
questions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan’s Ministry
of Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on
investigations.
During the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific
to uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This
included interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement
officials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence
reports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings
and other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in
Myanmar’s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia’s Golden
Triangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing
drugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited
the Thai compound of one of the syndicate’s alleged drug lords.
What emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly
transnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the
AFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often
refer to as “T1” - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong,
Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.
The syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and
sophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin
American cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies
a bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a
more diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels
do, including Japan’s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic
Chinese gangs across Southeast Asia.
The crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled
outbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police
say. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked
rivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a
united pursuit of gargantuan profits.
“The crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate
with seamless efficiency,” says one veteran Western anti-drugs
official. “They function like a global corporation.”
Like most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed,
the investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.
In addition to the contrasts between their drug operations,
there’s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop
and Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed
Mexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine
trafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their
extravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has
been revealed about Tse’s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug
lords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.

A TRIP, A TRAP
Tse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern
China, and grew up during China’s Cultural Revolution. Amid the
bloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group
of imprisoned members of Mao’s Red Guard in the southern city of
Guangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big
Circle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police,
and like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong
Kong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their
criminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.
In the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong,
Macau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based
in Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling
ring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless
opium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand,
China and Laos meet.
In 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on
drug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New
York. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into
America, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over
his head.
Through a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged
for leniency.
His ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His
12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed.
If freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed
“great sorrow” for his crime, court records show.
The entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to
nine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional
institution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.
After he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to
Canada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for
the next four years. It’s unclear when Tse returned to his old
haunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife
registered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company
Ltd, in Hong Kong in 2011.
Police suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He
“picked up where he left off,” said the senior AFP investigator.
Tse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and
the Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved
irresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his
drug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no
extra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.
His policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for
business, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011,
AFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and
meth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather
than arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under
surveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely
for more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug
cell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They
wanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.
The syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other
drug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and
selling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the
syndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the
Melbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police
watched the Australian meet two men.
One of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted
hair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese
family man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance
showed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal
security. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of
Thai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eight
worked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as
part of his security protocol.
Tse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts
and five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in
private jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand
for a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt,
according to a member of the task force investigating the
syndicate.
Tse was a frequent visitor to Asia’s casinos and fond of
betting on horses, especially on English races. “We believe he
lost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the
tables in Macau,” said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.
As the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected
that the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia
with meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA,
commonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the
Sam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say,
when a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of
white powder strapped to each of his thighs.

‘ALADDIN’S CAVE OF INTEL’
Cai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the
airport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It
was the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous,
picking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said
a former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation.
“His hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,” the
commander told Reuters. “Methamphetamine is very toxic.”
Cai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs
was a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful
tranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. “We were very
fortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,” the
commander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been
monitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police
had no idea who he was.
Cai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a
“pesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,” according to
Myanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A
friend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father.
Cai’s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for
ketamine at the airport, the commander said.
Unimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight.
The next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport.
One recognized him from surveillance work he’d been conducting.
Still, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they
later found on one of his phones might have explained his
silence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least
three assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch
and electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said
one investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy
saying “Loyalty to the Heavens.” The banner was a “triad-related
sign,” he added.
The tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed
the video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat
because he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a
law enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of
the victim’s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad
members were sending a message about the price of disloyalty,
the officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.
The torture videos were just one of the items allegedly
found in Cai’s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was
a diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate’s activities, but
sloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones,
police say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media
conversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.
They were “an Aladdin’s Cave of intel,” said one AFP
commander based in North Asia.
For at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly
travelled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for
the syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the
Drug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its
investigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip
from an international courier company recording the delivery of
two consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf
Chinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea
packets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had
been cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.
Two days after Cai’s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon
address, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That
evening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon
jetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so,
Myanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but
other than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate,
including couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.
Then came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery
of photos and videos on Cai’s phones, an AFP investigator based
in Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing
he had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier.
“This one stuck out because it was Canadian,” he recalled. “I
said: ‘Fuck, I know who you are!'”
It was Tse Chi Lop.
The Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of
intelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work
on Cai’s phones.
Australia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime
gangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade,
the AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and
small, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent
described the database, which includes a trove of names,
chemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and
surveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence
on Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.
The AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai’s
phones with the database. They discovered photos related to
three big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in
China, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators
and Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese
anti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and
addresses in Cai’s phones to other meth busts in China.
For regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations
upended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by
different crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the
work of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics
agent said they believed Cai was “one of the members of a
mega-syndicate,” which had been involved in multiple “drugs
cases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.”
Cai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still
in jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking
charges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to
contact Cai’s lawyer.

METH PARADISE
During his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing
the country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and
obtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a
bigger vessel in international waters, according to police and
the Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures
of the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where
the meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.
The police reconstruction of Cai’s dealings in Myanmar led
to another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production
had shifted from China’s southern provinces to Shan State in
Myanmar’s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had
provided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor
ingredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were
smuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in
the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the
freedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.
Armed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan
State have long controlled large tracts of territory and used
drug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the
military. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar
government with rebel groups over the years has brought relative
calm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to
flourish.
“Production facilities can be hidden from law enforcement
and other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,”
analyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the
International Crisis Group. “Drug production and profits are now
so vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.”
The Myanmar government and police did not respond to
questions from Reuters.
Along the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there
is evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts
a deep ravine known as the “Valley of Death,” where ethnic
Kachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for
decades with Myanmar’s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past
trucks carrying building materials and workers.
The Kaung Kha militia’s immaculate and expansive new
headquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green
hills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers
away, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved
out of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned
out vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba
tablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine.
When it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more
than 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg
of caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances
used in drug production.
The Loikan facility was “very likely” to have been the
source of much of the Sam Gor syndicate’s meth, said the
Yangon-based AFP officer.
“Some militia were involved in the lab,” said Oi Khun, a
communications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia,
in an interview. He paused, then added: “But not with the
knowledge of senior members” of the militia.
One person in Loikan described how workers from the lab
would come down from the hills. The men, like most of the
villagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the
locals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.
“I asked them once. ‘Why don’t you bathe?’” the person said.
“They said they did, but there was nothing they could do about
the smell.”
The rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the
skin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature
stench might reveal their illicit activities. “We all knew,” the
person said. “We just didn’t talk about it. That just brings you
danger.”
Meth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals,
say Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network’s
couriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the
Asia-Pacific.
Shan’s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the
world, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told
Reuters. “They can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the
ground and let it dry.”
The UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth
is worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business
model for meth is “very different” to heroin, said the UNODC’s
Douglas. “Inputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not
needed, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore
far, far higher.”
The wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in
northeastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a
UNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control
Commission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to
the UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand,
$298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the
Japanese market, that’s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.
The money the syndicate is making “means that if they lose
ten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,”
said the Chinese counter-narcotics official. “They can afford
failure. It doesn’t matter.”

‘MONEY, MONEY’
The analysis of Cai’s phones was continuing to provide
leads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the
pick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with
Myanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at
sea for weeks.
One of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the
Shun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement
document reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea
when, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a
marine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and
paid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV
Valkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s
and hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea
sickness tablets. According to local media, he didn’t have a
fishing license at the time.
After buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on
a course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in
the Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the
rendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western
Australian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was
seen “unloading a lot of packages” into a van, the commander
said.
“We knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of
organized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and
comes back with some gear on it, that it hasn’t just dropped
from the sky in the middle of the ocean.”
Investigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car
hire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug
traffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say,
that some of Smith’s alleged co-conspirators were members of an
ethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and
Comanchero motorcycle gangs, known as “bikies” in Australia.
As they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of
crystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor
syndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy
of an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians
reconvened in Perth a month later.
Bikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and
a self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had
refined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star
hotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police
investigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants,
said the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth.
The restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that
included caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.
On November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again,
this time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the
Andaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth
from Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast
of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the
Indian Ocean.
The Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.
When the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in
international waters off the West Australian coast on December
19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting “money, money,”
according to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De
Man’s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith
and his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved
their identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by
the crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.
The Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of
Geraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The
men unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of
the AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault
weapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty
to importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of
his alleged associates are still on trial.
Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it
had “worked together with our counterparts on the investigation”
of the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the “substantial
seizure of illicit narcotics” by the Australian authorities in
December 2017. The bureau said it was “aware that Taiwanese
syndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in
(the) Asia-Pacific region,” and was working “collaboratively and
closely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and
cross-border drug trafficking.”

NIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED
As the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police
concluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone
a kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the
three biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the
1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The
other two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse’s original triad, and the
Bamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator,
the syndicate’s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that
it “must rival Apple’s.”
“The syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market
to tap,” said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior
colonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade.
“The power this network possesses is unimaginable.”
Investigators have had wins. In February last year, police
busted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough
tea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66
was intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than
one tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor
lieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar.
In December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected
syndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.
Located near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed
compound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used
to experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a
100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to
the back of the property.
Sue wasn’t there, but property and money from 38 bank
accounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized
during the investigation. Sue is still at large.
But the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the
wider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal
meth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and
Southeast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in
most countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising
seizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019,
“suggested the supply of the drug had expanded.”
In the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive
adversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug
motherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product
in shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth
coming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the
syndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This
included deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each
containing about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on
narrow jungle paths.
Over the years, police have had little success in taking
down Asia’s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders
have been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to
the AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics
kingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than
a short period was in the mid-1970s. That’s when Ng Sik-ho, a
wily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced
to 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium
and morphine, according to court records.
So far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho’s fate. He is being
tracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say
counter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they
believe he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.

              <p>NAIROBI, Oct 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda will
not impose the death penalty for gay sex, a presidential
spokesman said on Monday, after major aid donors  said they were
monitoring a plan by the African nation to reintroduce a bill
colloquially known as ""Kill the Gays"".</p>
              <p>Uganda's Ethics and Integrity Minister Simon Lokodo last
Thursday said the government planned to re-introduce an
anti-homosexuality bill in parliament within weeks to curb the
spread of homosexuality in the east African nation.</p>
              <p>Lokodo's statement was widely reported across the world and
international donors such as the European Union, World Bank, the
United States and the Global Fund said they were monitoring the
situation closely and stood by the rights of LGBT+ people.</p>
              <p>A spokesperson for President Yoweri Museveni on Monday said
the government has no plans to introduce the legislation that
would impose the death penalty for gay sex.</p>
              <p>""There are no plans by the government to introduce a law
like that,"" Don Wanyama, President Museveni's senior press
secretary told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p>""We have the penal code that already handles issues of
unnatural sexual behaviour so there is no law coming up.""</p>
              <p>Lokodo told the Thomson Reuters Foundation and local press
last week that the bill was about to be tabled in the largely
conservative Christian country where gay sex is currently
punishable with  life imprisonment under British colonial law.</p>
              <p>This prompted major aid donors on Friday to voice concerns,
and a government spokesman took to Twitter on Saturday to deny
any such plan.</p>
              <p>It was not possible to confirm any link between the donors'
concerns and the government spokesman's statement on Saturday.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>VIOLENCE AND PREJUDICE</p>
              <p>When asked why Lokodo had made the statement, Wanyama said:
""Ask him. I don't know where he got this idea from. There is no
plan by government to introduce a law of that nature.""</p>
              <p>Lokodo said the bill - that was nullified five years ago on
a technicality - was being resurrected and would be voted on by
the end of the year.</p>
              <p>""Our current penal law is limited. It only criminalises the
act,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p>""We want it made clear that anyone who is even involved in
promotion and recruitment has to be criminalised. Those that do
grave acts will be given the death sentence.""</p>
              <p>Lokodo did not immediately respond to calls and messages
from the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Monday.</p>
              <p>Earlier this year, Brunei in Southeast Asia sparked
international outcry over plans to impose the death penalty for
gay sex, backtracking only after intense criticism.</p>
              <p>African countries have some of the world's most prohibitive
laws governing homosexuality with same-sex relationships
considered taboo and gay sex deemed a crime across most of the
continent, with punishments ranging from imprisonment to death.</p>
              <p>Uganda is seen as one of the most difficult countries in
Africa to be in a sexual minority with members of the LGBT
community facing prejudice in getting jobs, renting housing or
seeking medical care or education.</p>
              <p>LGBT+ rights groups report that three gay men and one
transgender woman had been killed in homophobic attacks in
Uganda this year - the latest on Oct. 4 when a gay man was
bludgeoned to death.</p>
              <p>Rejected by their families and fearful for their lives,
hundreds of LGBT+ Ugandans have fled over the last five years to
seek refuge to countries such as neighbouring Kenya.</p>
              <p>Human rights groups said Lokodo's comments would inflame
homophobic attitudes further.</p>
              <p>""This is an example of how Uganda's politicians are stoking
dangerous intolerance and bias against LGBTI people,"" said
Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International's director for East Africa,
the Horn and the Great Lakes, in a statement.

like that,"" Don Wanyama, President Museveni's senior press
secretary told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
""We have the penal code that already handles issues of
unnatural sexual behaviour so there is no law coming up.""
Lokodo told the Thomson Reuters Foundation and local press
last week that the bill was about to be tabled in the largely
conservative Christian country where gay sex is currently
punishable with  life imprisonment under British colonial law.
This prompted major aid donors on Friday to voice concerns,
and a government spokesman took to Twitter on Saturday to deny
any such plan.
It was not possible to confirm any link between the donors'
concerns and the government spokesman's statement on Saturday.

VIOLENCE AND PREJUDICE
When asked why Lokodo had made the statement, Wanyama said:
""Ask him. I don't know where he got this idea from. There is no
plan by government to introduce a law of that nature.""
Lokodo said the bill - that was nullified five years ago on
a technicality - was being resurrected and would be voted on by
the end of the year.
""Our current penal law is limited. It only criminalises the
act,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
""We want it made clear that anyone who is even involved in
promotion and recruitment has to be criminalised. Those that do
grave acts will be given the death sentence.""
Lokodo did not immediately respond to calls and messages
from the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Monday.
Earlier this year, Brunei in Southeast Asia sparked
international outcry over plans to impose the death penalty for
gay sex, backtracking only after intense criticism.
African countries have some of the world's most prohibitive
laws governing homosexuality with same-sex relationships
considered taboo and gay sex deemed a crime across most of the
continent, with punishments ranging from imprisonment to death.
Uganda is seen as one of the most difficult countries in
Africa to be in a sexual minority with members of the LGBT
community facing prejudice in getting jobs, renting housing or
seeking medical care or education.
LGBT+ rights groups report that three gay men and one
transgender woman had been killed in homophobic attacks in
Uganda this year - the latest on Oct. 4 when a gay man was
bludgeoned to death.
Rejected by their families and fearful for their lives,
hundreds of LGBT+ Ugandans have fled over the last five years to
seek refuge to countries such as neighbouring Kenya.
Human rights groups said Lokodo's comments would inflame
homophobic attitudes further.
""This is an example of how Uganda's politicians are stoking
dangerous intolerance and bias against LGBTI people,"" said
Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International's director for East Africa,
the Horn and the Great Lakes, in a statement.

              <p>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Oct 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -
K ellu became pregnant after a Nigerian soldier offered her food
and shelter in exchange for sex. But the destitute teenager -
who lost her family when Boko Haram militants attacked her
village two years earlier - did not want to have the baby.</p>
              <p>After moving to a camp for displaced people in northeastern
Borno state, where she relied on neighbours for food,
18-year-old Kellu wanted an abortion but did not know where to
go - like a growing number of women since the Islamist
insurgency began.</p>
              <p>""If I continue with this pregnancy, it will ruin my life,""
Kellu, who guessed she was about two months pregnant, told the
Thomson Reuters Foundation, sitting on a mat in a building
pock-marked with bullet holes.</p>
              <p>""Everyone will know what I did. They will stigmatise me for
having a baby without a husband. Also, I have no money to take
care of myself. How am I supposed to look after a child?"" asked
Kellu, who declined to publish her real name.</p>
              <p>Nigeria has some of the world's most restrictive abortion
laws, which only allow abortion to save the life of the mother.</p>
              <p>The Johns Hopkins University estimates that 2.7 million
abortions are carried out in Nigeria each year, the majority
performed secretly and in dangerous conditions, with poor,
uneducated women most at risk.</p>
              <p>Health and aid workers say unsafe abortions have surged in
northern Nigeria since the start of the Boko Haram conflict in
2009, which has driven 1.8 million Nigerians from their homes,
according to the United Nations.</p>
              <p>At least 40 women and girls come in for emergency
post-abortion care each month, said Aminu, a senior nurse in a
busy government clinic in Yobe state - west of Borno state -
about three times the average of 10 to 15 a month a decade
earlier.
Nigeria has the fourth highest maternal mortality rate
globally, according to the World Health Organization, with about
100 women and girls dying each day.</p>
              <p>Death rates in the northeast - where clinics and hospitals
have been destroyed as armed groups fight to create an Islamic
caliphate - are the worst in Nigeria, government data shows.</p>
              <p>Women and girls go to pharmacies, vendors of locally made
drugs and older women to terminate pregnancies, using
medication, herbs or tools like sticks, Aminu said.</p>
              <p>Fatima, is was in her 40s, went to an aunt who gave her
herbs that caused a miscarriage in a few hours.</p>
              <p>""It wasn't a choice, I had to end it,"" said Fatima, who
declined to publish her real name, who was raising five children
and four grandchildren in a displaced camp in Borno state.</p>
              <p>""Men say it's immorality. But they are not the ones who have
to give birth and look after the babies. When your children are
telling you they are hungry, how can you have another one?"" she
asked, adding foetuses are often found in the camp's toilets.</p>
              <p>Nigerian officials insist the law is upheld.</p>
              <p>""Regardless of circumstances, abortion is prohibited except
for medical reasons,"" said Ali Grema, deputy director of
emergency medical response in the health ministry in Borno
state. ""It is not allowed for social reasons.""</p>
              <p>TABOO</p>
              <p>With many husbands missing, detained or dead, more women are
having sex outside marriage, aid workers said.</p>
              <p>While some women choose to get into new relationships, the
United Nations has recorded thousands of cases of sexual
violence and transactional sex, particularly by women and girls
who lack food, shelter or money.</p>
              <p>""Many people who are displaced live with hosts who take
advantage of them. If they say no, they may lose their housing,""
said Maryam Aje, head of the African Youth for Peace Development
and Empowerment Foundation, which gives women business grants.</p>
              <p>Pointing to a poster in a Maiduguri camp encouraging women
to space their children, Hadiza - a nurse working in a nearby
clinic - said family planning messages focused on married women
because of conservative attitudes.</p>
              <p>""Women will ask for contraception but they don't want
husbands to know,"" said Hadiza, who declined to publish her real
name. ""(They) come at night, when nobody is around.""</p>
              <p>Hadiza said she often received calls or visits from young
women after working hours, asking for the morning-after pill.</p>
              <p>""It's better to prevent such pregnancies than try and deal
with them when they happen,"" she said.</p>
              <p>Many girls do not even know sex can make them pregnant, said
Lucy Dlama of Women in New Nigeria, which supports rape
survivors with health care.</p>
              <p>""Our culture means it is taboo for parents to discuss sex

MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Oct 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -
K ellu became pregnant after a Nigerian soldier offered her food
and shelter in exchange for sex. But the destitute teenager -
who lost her family when Boko Haram militants attacked her
village two years earlier - did not want to have the baby.
After moving to a camp for displaced people in northeastern
Borno state, where she relied on neighbours for food,
18-year-old Kellu wanted an abortion but did not know where to
go - like a growing number of women since the Islamist
insurgency began.
""If I continue with this pregnancy, it will ruin my life,""
Kellu, who guessed she was about two months pregnant, told the
Thomson Reuters Foundation, sitting on a mat in a building
pock-marked with bullet holes.
""Everyone will know what I did. They will stigmatise me for
having a baby without a husband. Also, I have no money to take
care of myself. How am I supposed to look after a child?"" asked
Kellu, who declined to publish her real name.
Nigeria has some of the world's most restrictive abortion
laws, which only allow abortion to save the life of the mother.
The Johns Hopkins University estimates that 2.7 million
abortions are carried out in Nigeria each year, the majority
performed secretly and in dangerous conditions, with poor,
uneducated women most at risk.
Health and aid workers say unsafe abortions have surged in
northern Nigeria since the start of the Boko Haram conflict in
2009, which has driven 1.8 million Nigerians from their homes,
according to the United Nations.
At least 40 women and girls come in for emergency
post-abortion care each month, said Aminu, a senior nurse in a
busy government clinic in Yobe state - west of Borno state -
about three times the average of 10 to 15 a month a decade
earlier.
Nigeria has the fourth highest maternal mortality rate
globally, according to the World Health Organization, with about
100 women and girls dying each day.
Death rates in the northeast - where clinics and hospitals
have been destroyed as armed groups fight to create an Islamic
caliphate - are the worst in Nigeria, government data shows.
Women and girls go to pharmacies, vendors of locally made
drugs and older women to terminate pregnancies, using
medication, herbs or tools like sticks, Aminu said.
Fatima, is was in her 40s, went to an aunt who gave her
herbs that caused a miscarriage in a few hours.
""It wasn't a choice, I had to end it,"" said Fatima, who
declined to publish her real name, who was raising five children
and four grandchildren in a displaced camp in Borno state.
""Men say it's immorality. But they are not the ones who have
to give birth and look after the babies. When your children are
telling you they are hungry, how can you have another one?"" she
asked, adding foetuses are often found in the camp's toilets.
Nigerian officials insist the law is upheld.
""Regardless of circumstances, abortion is prohibited except
for medical reasons,"" said Ali Grema, deputy director of
emergency medical response in the health ministry in Borno
state. ""It is not allowed for social reasons.""
TABOO
With many husbands missing, detained or dead, more women are
having sex outside marriage, aid workers said.
While some women choose to get into new relationships, the
United Nations has recorded thousands of cases of sexual
violence and transactional sex, particularly by women and girls
who lack food, shelter or money.
""Many people who are displaced live with hosts who take
advantage of them. If they say no, they may lose their housing,""
said Maryam Aje, head of the African Youth for Peace Development
and Empowerment Foundation, which gives women business grants.
Pointing to a poster in a Maiduguri camp encouraging women
to space their children, Hadiza - a nurse working in a nearby
clinic - said family planning messages focused on married women
because of conservative attitudes.
""Women will ask for contraception but they don't want
husbands to know,"" said Hadiza, who declined to publish her real
name. ""(They) come at night, when nobody is around.""
Hadiza said she often received calls or visits from young
women after working hours, asking for the morning-after pill.
""It's better to prevent such pregnancies than try and deal
with them when they happen,"" she said.
Many girls do not even know sex can make them pregnant, said
Lucy Dlama of Women in New Nigeria, which supports rape
survivors with health care.
""Our culture means it is taboo for parents to discuss sex
education with their daughters,"" said Dlama, who encourages
mothers to teach girls about their bodies. ""They can think it is
stomach pain, give birth and then panic.""
Aminu, the nurse, said most of his patients needing
post-abortion care were teenagers who tried to abort after
several months because they did not know they were pregnant or
hid it.
""They do not die if we admit them to hospital,"" he said.
""But there are so many more cases where women and girls take
herbs on their own, do not come to the hospital and die because
they do not want to expose themselves.""
Pregnancy outside marriage is a taboo, even when it is the
result of rape by soldiers, militias or camp officials.
""They consider you to be a whore and your child to be a
bastard. You have spoiled your family name,"" Aminu said.
Another factor is a decades-old U.S. government policy,
known as the global ""gag rule"" and reinstated by President
Donald Trump in 2017, barring clinics that receive federal funds
from talking to patients about abortion.
""We see young girls and women requesting abortion,"" said one

state and spoke on condition of anonymity.

community reactions and by our U.S. funding which prohibits us

              <p>BANGKOK (Reuters) - He is Asia’s most-wanted man. He is protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private jet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night at a Macau casino.</p>
              <p>Tse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected of leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate formed out of an alliance of five of Asia’s triad groups, according to law enforcement officials. Its members call it simply “The Company.” Police, in a nod to one of Tse’s nicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for “Brother Number Three.”</p>
              <p>The syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of methamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen countries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South Pacific. But meth – a highly addictive drug with devastating physical and mental effects on long-term users – is its main business, they say.</p>
              <p>In what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate’s meth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be as high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the cartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a 40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has expanded at least fourfold in the past five years.</p>
              <p>This unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an unprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the prime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously unreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the Australian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about 20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far the biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug trafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in the investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar, China, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan, while not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the investigation.</p>
              <p>A document containing AFP profiles of the operation’s top 19 syndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the leader of the syndicate. According to the document, the organization has “been connected with or directly involved in at least 13 cases” of drug trafficking since January 2015. The document does not provide specific details of the cases.</p>
              <p>A Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the “Multinational CEO” of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional government agencies says Tse is “believed to be” the leader of the Sam Gor syndicate.</p>
              <p>Police have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected boss of the trafficking group.</p>
              <p>Some investigators say that the scope of the syndicate’s operation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin America’s most legendary narco-traffickers. “Tse Chi Lop is in the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,” said Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC. “The word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no doubt it applies here.”</p>
              <p>Reuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to questions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on investigations.</p>
              <p>During the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific to uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This included interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement officials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence reports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings and other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in Myanmar’s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia’s Golden Triangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing drugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited the Thai compound of one of the syndicate’s alleged drug lords.</p>
              <p>What emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly transnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the AFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often refer to as “T1” - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.</p>
              <p>The syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and sophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin American cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies a bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a more diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels do, including Japan’s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic Chinese gangs across Southeast Asia.</p>
              <p>The crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled outbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police say. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked rivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a united pursuit of gargantuan profits.</p>
              <p>“The crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate with seamless efficiency,” says one veteran Western anti-drugs official. “They function like a global corporation.”</p>
              <p>Like most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed, the investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
              <p>In addition to the contrasts between their drug operations, there’s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop and Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed Mexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine trafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their extravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has been revealed about Tse’s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug lords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>A TRIP, A TRAP</p>
              <p>Tse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern China, and grew up during China’s Cultural Revolution. Amid the bloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group of imprisoned members of Mao’s Red Guard in the southern city of Guangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big Circle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police, and like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong Kong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their criminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.</p>
              <p>In the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong, Macau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based in Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling ring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless opium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand, China and Laos meet.</p>
              <p>In 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on drug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New York. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into America, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over his head.</p>
              <p>Through a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged for leniency.</p>
              <p>His ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His 12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed. If freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed “great sorrow” for his crime, court records show.</p>
              <p>The entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to nine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional institution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.</p>
              <p>After he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to Canada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for the next four years. It’s unclear when Tse returned to his old haunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife registered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company Ltd, in Hong Kong in 2011.</p>
              <p>Police suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He “picked up where he left off,” said the senior AFP investigator. Tse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and the Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved irresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his drug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no extra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.</p>
              <p>His policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for business, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011, AFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and meth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather than arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under surveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely for more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug cell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They wanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.</p>
              <p>The syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other drug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and selling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the syndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the Melbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police watched the Australian meet two men.</p>
              <p>One of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted hair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese family man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance showed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal security. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eight worked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as part of his security protocol.</p>
              <p>Tse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts and five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in private jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand for a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt, according to a member of the task force investigating the syndicate.</p>
              <p>Tse was a frequent visitor to Asia’s casinos and fond of betting on horses, especially on English races. “We believe he lost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the tables in Macau,” said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.</p>
              <p>As the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected that the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia with meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the Sam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say, when a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of white powder strapped to each of his thighs.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>‘ALADDIN’S CAVE OF INTEL’</p>
              <p>Cai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the airport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It was the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous, picking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said a former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation. “His hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,” the commander told Reuters. “Methamphetamine is very toxic.”</p>
              <p>Cai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs was a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful tranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. “We were very fortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,” the commander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been monitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police had no idea who he was.</p>
              <p>Cai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a “pesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,” according to Myanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A friend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father. Cai’s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for ketamine at the airport, the commander said.</p>
              <p>Unimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight. The next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport. One recognized him from surveillance work he’d been conducting.</p>
              <p>Still, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they later found on one of his phones might have explained his silence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least three assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch and electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said one investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy saying “Loyalty to the Heavens.” The banner was a “triad-related sign,” he added.</p>
              <p>The tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed the video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat because he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a law enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of the victim’s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad members were sending a message about the price of disloyalty, the officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.</p>
              <p>The torture videos were just one of the items allegedly found in Cai’s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was a diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate’s activities, but sloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones, police say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media conversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.</p>
              <p>They were “an Aladdin’s Cave of intel,” said one AFP commander based in North Asia.</p>
              <p>For at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly traveled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for the syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the Drug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its investigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip from an international courier company recording the delivery of two consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf Chinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea packets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had been cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
              <p>Two days after Cai’s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon address, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That evening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon jetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so, Myanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but other than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate, including couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.</p>
              <p>Then came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery of photos and videos on Cai’s phones, an AFP investigator based in Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing he had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier. “This one stuck out because it was Canadian,” he recalled. “I said: ‘Fuck, I know who you are!'”</p>
              <p>It was Tse Chi Lop.</p>
              <p>The Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of intelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work on Cai’s phones.</p>
              <p>Australia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime gangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade, the AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and small, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent described the database, which includes a trove of names, chemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and surveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence on Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.</p>
              <p>The AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai’s phones with the database. They discovered photos related to three big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in China, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators and Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese anti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and addresses in Cai’s phones to other meth busts in China.</p>
              <p>For regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations upended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by different crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the work of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics agent said they believed Cai was “one of the members of a mega-syndicate,” which had been involved in multiple “drugs cases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.”</p>
              <p>Cai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still in jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking charges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to contact Cai’s lawyer.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>METH PARADISE</p>
              <p>During his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing the country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and obtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a bigger vessel in international waters, according to police and the Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures of the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where the meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.</p>
              <p>The police reconstruction of Cai’s dealings in Myanmar led to another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production had shifted from China’s southern provinces to Shan State in Myanmar’s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had provided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor ingredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were smuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the freedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.</p>
              <p>Armed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan State have long controlled large tracts of territory and used drug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the military. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar government with rebel groups over the years has brought relative calm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to flourish.</p>
              <p>“Production facilities can be hidden from law enforcement and other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,” analyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the International Crisis Group. “Drug production and profits are now so vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.”</p>
              <p>The Myanmar government and police did not respond to questions from Reuters.</p>
              <p>Along the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there is evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts a deep ravine known as the “Valley of Death,” where ethnic Kachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for decades with Myanmar’s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past trucks carrying building materials and workers.</p>
              <p>The Kaung Kha militia’s immaculate and expansive new headquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green hills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers away, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved out of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned out vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba tablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine. When it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more than 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg of caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances used in drug production.</p>
              <p>The Loikan facility was “very likely” to have been the source of much of the Sam Gor syndicate’s meth, said the Yangon-based AFP officer.</p>
              <p>“Some militia were involved in the lab,” said Oi Khun, a communications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia, in an interview. He paused, then added: “But not with the knowledge of senior members” of the militia.</p>
              <p>One person in Loikan described how workers from the lab would come down from the hills. The men, like most of the villagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the locals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.</p>
              <p>“I asked them once. ‘Why don’t you bathe?’” the person said. “They said they did, but there was nothing they could do about the smell.”</p>
              <p>The rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the skin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature stench might reveal their illicit activities. “We all knew,” the person said. “We just didn’t talk about it. That just brings you danger.”</p>
              <p>Meth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals, say Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network’s couriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the Asia-Pacific.</p>
              <p>Shan’s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the world, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told Reuters. “They can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the ground and let it dry.”</p>
              <p>The UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth is worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business model for meth is “very different” to heroin, said the UNODC’s Douglas. “Inputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not needed, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore far, far higher.”</p>
              <p>The wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in northeastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a UNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control Commission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to the UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand, $298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the Japanese market, that’s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.</p>
              <p>The money the syndicate is making “means that if they lose ten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,” said the Chinese counter-narcotics official. “They can afford failure. It doesn’t matter.”</p>
              <p/>
              <p>‘MONEY, MONEY’</p>
              <p>The analysis of Cai’s phones was continuing to provide leads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the pick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with Myanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at sea for weeks.</p>
              <p>One of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the Shun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement document reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea when, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a marine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and paid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV Valkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s and hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea sickness tablets. According to local media, he didn’t have a fishing license at the time.</p>
              <p>After buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on a course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in the Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the rendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western Australian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was seen “unloading a lot of packages” into a van, the commander said.</p>
              <p>“We knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of organized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and comes back with some gear on it, that it hasn’t just dropped from the sky in the middle of the ocean.”</p>
              <p>Investigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car hire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug traffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say, that some of Smith’s alleged co-conspirators were members of an ethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and Comanchero motorcycle gangs, known as “bikies” in Australia.</p>
              <p>As they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of crystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor syndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy of an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians reconvened in Perth a month later.</p>
              <p>Bikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and a self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had refined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star hotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police investigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants, said the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar &amp; Grill in Perth. The restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that included caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.</p>
              <p>On November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again, this time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the Andaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth from Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the Indian Ocean.</p>
              <p>The Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.</p>
              <p>When the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in international waters off the West Australian coast on December 19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting “money, money,” according to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De Man’s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith and his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved their identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by the crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.</p>
              <p>The Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of Geraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The men unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of the AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault weapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty to importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of his alleged associates are still on trial.</p>
              <p>Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it had “worked together with our counterparts on the investigation” of the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the “substantial seizure of illicit narcotics” by the Australian authorities in December 2017. The bureau said it was “aware that Taiwanese syndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in (the) Asia-Pacific region,” and was working “collaboratively and closely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and cross-border drug trafficking.”</p>
              <p/>
              <p>NIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED</p>
              <p>As the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police concluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone a kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the three biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the 1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The other two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse’s original triad, and the Bamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator, the syndicate’s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that it “must rival Apple’s.”</p>
              <p>“The syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market to tap,” said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior colonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade. “The power this network possesses is unimaginable.”</p>
              <p>Investigators have had wins. In February last year, police busted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough tea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66 was intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than one tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor lieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar. In December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected syndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.</p>
              <p>Located near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed compound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used to experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a 100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to the back of the property.</p>
              <p>Sue wasn’t there, but property and money from 38 bank accounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized during the investigation. Sue is still at large.</p>
              <p>But the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the wider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal meth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and Southeast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in most countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising seizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019, “suggested the supply of the drug had expanded.”</p>
              <p>In the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive adversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug motherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product in shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth coming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the syndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This included deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each containing about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on narrow jungle paths.</p>
              <p>Over the years, police have had little success in taking down Asia’s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders have been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to the AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics kingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than a short period was in the mid-1970s. That’s when Ng Sik-ho, a wily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium and morphine, according to court records.</p>
              <p>So far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho’s fate. He is being tracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say counter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they believe he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.</p>

BANGKOK (Reuters) - He is Asia’s most-wanted man. He is protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private jet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night at a Macau casino.
Tse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected of leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate formed out of an alliance of five of Asia’s triad groups, according to law enforcement officials. Its members call it simply “The Company.” Police, in a nod to one of Tse’s nicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for “Brother Number Three.”
The syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of methamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen countries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South Pacific. But meth – a highly addictive drug with devastating physical and mental effects on long-term users – is its main business, they say.
In what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate’s meth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be as high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the cartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a 40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has expanded at least fourfold in the past five years.
This unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an unprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the prime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously unreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the Australian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about 20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far the biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug trafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in the investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar, China, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan, while not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the investigation.
A document containing AFP profiles of the operation’s top 19 syndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the leader of the syndicate. According to the document, the organization has “been connected with or directly involved in at least 13 cases” of drug trafficking since January 2015. The document does not provide specific details of the cases.
A Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the “Multinational CEO” of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional government agencies says Tse is “believed to be” the leader of the Sam Gor syndicate.
Police have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected boss of the trafficking group.
Some investigators say that the scope of the syndicate’s operation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin America’s most legendary narco-traffickers. “Tse Chi Lop is in the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,” said Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC. “The word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no doubt it applies here.”
Reuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to questions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on investigations.
During the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific to uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This included interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement officials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence reports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings and other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in Myanmar’s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia’s Golden Triangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing drugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited the Thai compound of one of the syndicate’s alleged drug lords.
What emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly transnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the AFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often refer to as “T1” - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.
The syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and sophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin American cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies a bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a more diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels do, including Japan’s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic Chinese gangs across Southeast Asia.
The crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled outbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police say. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked rivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a united pursuit of gargantuan profits.
“The crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate with seamless efficiency,” says one veteran Western anti-drugs official. “They function like a global corporation.”
Like most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed, the investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.
In addition to the contrasts between their drug operations, there’s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop and Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed Mexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine trafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their extravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has been revealed about Tse’s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug lords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.

A TRIP, A TRAP
Tse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern China, and grew up during China’s Cultural Revolution. Amid the bloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group of imprisoned members of Mao’s Red Guard in the southern city of Guangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big Circle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police, and like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong Kong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their criminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.
In the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong, Macau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based in Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling ring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless opium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand, China and Laos meet.
In 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on drug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New York. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into America, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over his head.
Through a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged for leniency.
His ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His 12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed. If freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed “great sorrow” for his crime, court records show.
The entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to nine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional institution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.
After he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to Canada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for the next four years. It’s unclear when Tse returned to his old haunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife registered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company Ltd, in Hong Kong in 2011.
Police suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He “picked up where he left off,” said the senior AFP investigator. Tse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and the Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved irresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his drug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no extra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.
His policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for business, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011, AFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and meth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather than arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under surveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely for more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug cell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They wanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.
The syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other drug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and selling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the syndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the Melbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police watched the Australian meet two men.
One of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted hair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese family man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance showed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal security. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eight worked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as part of his security protocol.
Tse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts and five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in private jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand for a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt, according to a member of the task force investigating the syndicate.
Tse was a frequent visitor to Asia’s casinos and fond of betting on horses, especially on English races. “We believe he lost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the tables in Macau,” said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.
As the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected that the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia with meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the Sam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say, when a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of white powder strapped to each of his thighs.

‘ALADDIN’S CAVE OF INTEL’
Cai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the airport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It was the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous, picking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said a former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation. “His hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,” the commander told Reuters. “Methamphetamine is very toxic.”
Cai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs was a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful tranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. “We were very fortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,” the commander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been monitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police had no idea who he was.
Cai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a “pesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,” according to Myanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A friend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father. Cai’s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for ketamine at the airport, the commander said.
Unimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight. The next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport. One recognized him from surveillance work he’d been conducting.
Still, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they later found on one of his phones might have explained his silence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least three assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch and electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said one investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy saying “Loyalty to the Heavens.” The banner was a “triad-related sign,” he added.
The tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed the video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat because he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a law enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of the victim’s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad members were sending a message about the price of disloyalty, the officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.
The torture videos were just one of the items allegedly found in Cai’s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was a diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate’s activities, but sloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones, police say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media conversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.
They were “an Aladdin’s Cave of intel,” said one AFP commander based in North Asia.
For at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly traveled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for the syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the Drug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its investigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip from an international courier company recording the delivery of two consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf Chinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea packets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had been cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.
Two days after Cai’s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon address, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That evening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon jetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so, Myanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but other than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate, including couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.
Then came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery of photos and videos on Cai’s phones, an AFP investigator based in Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing he had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier. “This one stuck out because it was Canadian,” he recalled. “I said: ‘Fuck, I know who you are!'”
It was Tse Chi Lop.
The Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of intelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work on Cai’s phones.
Australia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime gangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade, the AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and small, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent described the database, which includes a trove of names, chemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and surveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence on Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.
The AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai’s phones with the database. They discovered photos related to three big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in China, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators and Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese anti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and addresses in Cai’s phones to other meth busts in China.
For regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations upended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by different crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the work of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics agent said they believed Cai was “one of the members of a mega-syndicate,” which had been involved in multiple “drugs cases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.”
Cai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still in jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking charges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to contact Cai’s lawyer.

METH PARADISE
During his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing the country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and obtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a bigger vessel in international waters, according to police and the Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures of the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where the meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.
The police reconstruction of Cai’s dealings in Myanmar led to another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production had shifted from China’s southern provinces to Shan State in Myanmar’s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had provided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor ingredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were smuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the freedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.
Armed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan State have long controlled large tracts of territory and used drug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the military. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar government with rebel groups over the years has brought relative calm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to flourish.
“Production facilities can be hidden from law enforcement and other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,” analyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the International Crisis Group. “Drug production and profits are now so vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.”
The Myanmar government and police did not respond to questions from Reuters.
Along the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there is evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts a deep ravine known as the “Valley of Death,” where ethnic Kachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for decades with Myanmar’s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past trucks carrying building materials and workers.
The Kaung Kha militia’s immaculate and expansive new headquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green hills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers away, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved out of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned out vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba tablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine. When it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more than 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg of caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances used in drug production.
The Loikan facility was “very likely” to have been the source of much of the Sam Gor syndicate’s meth, said the Yangon-based AFP officer.
“Some militia were involved in the lab,” said Oi Khun, a communications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia, in an interview. He paused, then added: “But not with the knowledge of senior members” of the militia.
One person in Loikan described how workers from the lab would come down from the hills. The men, like most of the villagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the locals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.
“I asked them once. ‘Why don’t you bathe?’” the person said. “They said they did, but there was nothing they could do about the smell.”
The rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the skin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature stench might reveal their illicit activities. “We all knew,” the person said. “We just didn’t talk about it. That just brings you danger.”
Meth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals, say Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network’s couriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the Asia-Pacific.
Shan’s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the world, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told Reuters. “They can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the ground and let it dry.”
The UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth is worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business model for meth is “very different” to heroin, said the UNODC’s Douglas. “Inputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not needed, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore far, far higher.”
The wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in northeastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a UNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control Commission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to the UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand, $298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the Japanese market, that’s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.
The money the syndicate is making “means that if they lose ten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,” said the Chinese counter-narcotics official. “They can afford failure. It doesn’t matter.”

‘MONEY, MONEY’
The analysis of Cai’s phones was continuing to provide leads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the pick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with Myanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at sea for weeks.
One of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the Shun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement document reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea when, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a marine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and paid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV Valkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s and hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea sickness tablets. According to local media, he didn’t have a fishing license at the time.
After buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on a course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in the Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the rendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western Australian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was seen “unloading a lot of packages” into a van, the commander said.
“We knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of organized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and comes back with some gear on it, that it hasn’t just dropped from the sky in the middle of the ocean.”
Investigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car hire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug traffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say, that some of Smith’s alleged co-conspirators were members of an ethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and Comanchero motorcycle gangs, known as “bikies” in Australia.
As they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of crystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor syndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy of an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians reconvened in Perth a month later.
Bikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and a self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had refined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star hotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police investigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants, said the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth. The restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that included caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.
On November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again, this time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the Andaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth from Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the Indian Ocean.
The Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.
When the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in international waters off the West Australian coast on December 19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting “money, money,” according to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De Man’s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith and his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved their identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by the crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.
The Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of Geraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The men unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of the AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault weapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty to importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of his alleged associates are still on trial.
Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it had “worked together with our counterparts on the investigation” of the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the “substantial seizure of illicit narcotics” by the Australian authorities in December 2017. The bureau said it was “aware that Taiwanese syndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in (the) Asia-Pacific region,” and was working “collaboratively and closely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and cross-border drug trafficking.”

NIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED
As the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police concluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone a kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the three biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the 1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The other two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse’s original triad, and the Bamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator, the syndicate’s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that it “must rival Apple’s.”
“The syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market to tap,” said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior colonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade. “The power this network possesses is unimaginable.”
Investigators have had wins. In February last year, police busted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough tea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66 was intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than one tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor lieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar. In December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected syndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.
Located near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed compound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used to experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a 100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to the back of the property.
Sue wasn’t there, but property and money from 38 bank accounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized during the investigation. Sue is still at large.
But the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the wider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal meth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and Southeast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in most countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising seizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019, “suggested the supply of the drug had expanded.”
In the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive adversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug motherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product in shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth coming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the syndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This included deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each containing about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on narrow jungle paths.
Over the years, police have had little success in taking down Asia’s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders have been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to the AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics kingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than a short period was in the mid-1970s. That’s when Ng Sik-ho, a wily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium and morphine, according to court records.
So far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho’s fate. He is being tracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say counter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they believe he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.

              <p>By Tom Allard</p>
              <p>BANGKOK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - He is Asia’s most-wanted man. He
is protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private
jet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night
at a Macau casino.</p>
              <p>Tse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected
of leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate
formed out of an alliance of five of Asia’s triad groups,
according to law enforcement officials. Its members call it
simply “The Company.” Police, in a nod to one of Tse’s
nicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for “Brother Number
Three.”</p>
              <p>The syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of
methamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen
countries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South
Pacific. But meth – a highly addictive drug with devastating
physical and mental effects on long-term users – is its main
business, they say.</p>
              <p>In what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate’s
meth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be
as high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the
cartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a
40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has
expanded at least fourfold in the past five years.</p>
              <p>This unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an
unprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the
prime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously
unreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the
Australian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about
20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far
the biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug
trafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in
the investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar,
China, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan,
while not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the
investigation.</p>
              <p>A document containing AFP profiles of the operation’s top 19
syndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the
leader of the syndicate. According to the document, the
organization has “been connected with or directly involved in at
least 13 cases” of drug trafficking since January 2015. The
document does not provide specific details of the cases.</p>
              <p>A Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the
“Multinational CEO” of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional
government agencies says Tse is “believed to be” the leader of
the Sam Gor syndicate.</p>
              <p>Police have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected
boss of the trafficking group.</p>
              <p>Some investigators say that the scope of the syndicate’s
operation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin
America’s most legendary narco-traffickers. “Tse Chi Lop is in
the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,” said Jeremy
Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC.
“The word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no
doubt it applies here.”</p>
              <p>Reuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to
questions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan’s Ministry
of Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on
investigations.</p>
              <p>During the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific
to uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This
included interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement
officials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence
reports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings
and other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in
Myanmar’s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia’s Golden
Triangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing
drugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited
the Thai compound of one of the syndicate’s alleged drug lords.</p>
              <p>What emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly
transnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the
AFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often
refer to as “T1” - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong,
Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.</p>
              <p>The syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and
sophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin
American cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies
a bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a
more diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels
do, including Japan’s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic
Chinese gangs across Southeast Asia.</p>
              <p>The crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled
outbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police
say. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked
rivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a
united pursuit of gargantuan profits.</p>
              <p>“The crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate
with seamless efficiency,” says one veteran Western anti-drugs
official. “They function like a global corporation.”</p>
              <p>Like most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed,
the investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
              <p>In addition to the contrasts between their drug operations,
there’s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop
and Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed
Mexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine
trafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their
extravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has
been revealed about Tse’s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug
lords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>A TRIP, A TRAP</p>
              <p>Tse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern
China, and grew up during China’s Cultural Revolution. Amid the
bloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group
of imprisoned members of Mao’s Red Guard in the southern city of
Guangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big
Circle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police,
and like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong
Kong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their
criminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.</p>
              <p>In the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong,
Macau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based
in Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling
ring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless
opium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand,
China and Laos meet.</p>
              <p>In 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on
drug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New
York. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into
America, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over
his head.</p>
              <p>Through a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged
for leniency.</p>
              <p>His ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His
12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed.
If freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed
“great sorrow” for his crime, court records show.</p>
              <p>The entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to
nine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional
institution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.</p>
              <p>After he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to
Canada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for
the next four years. It’s unclear when Tse returned to his old
haunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife
registered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company
Ltd, in Hong Kong in 2011.</p>
              <p>Police suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He
“picked up where he left off,” said the senior AFP investigator.
Tse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and
the Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved
irresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his
drug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no
extra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.</p>
              <p>His policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for
business, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011,
AFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and
meth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather
than arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under
surveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely
for more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug
cell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They
wanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.</p>
              <p>The syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other
drug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and
selling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the
syndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the
Melbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police
watched the Australian meet two men.</p>
              <p>One of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted
hair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese
family man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance
showed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal
security. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of
Thai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eight
worked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as
part of his security protocol.</p>
              <p>Tse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts
and five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in
private jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand
for a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt,
according to a member of the task force investigating the
syndicate.</p>
              <p>Tse was a frequent visitor to Asia’s casinos and fond of
betting on horses, especially on English races. “We believe he
lost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the
tables in Macau,” said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.</p>
              <p>As the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected
that the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia
with meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA,
commonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the
Sam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say,
when a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of
white powder strapped to each of his thighs.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>‘ALADDIN’S CAVE OF INTEL’</p>
              <p>Cai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the
airport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It
was the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous,
picking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said
a former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation.
“His hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,” the
commander told Reuters. “Methamphetamine is very toxic.”</p>
              <p>Cai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs
was a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful
tranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. “We were very
fortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,” the
commander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been
monitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police
had no idea who he was.</p>
              <p>Cai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a
“pesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,” according to
Myanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A
friend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father.
Cai’s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for
ketamine at the airport, the commander said.</p>
              <p>Unimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight.
The next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport.
One recognized him from surveillance work he’d been conducting.</p>
              <p>Still, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they
later found on one of his phones might have explained his
silence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least
three assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch
and electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said
one investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy
saying “Loyalty to the Heavens.” The banner was a “triad-related
sign,” he added.</p>
              <p>The tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed
the video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat
because he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a
law enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of
the victim’s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad
members were sending a message about the price of disloyalty,
the officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.</p>
              <p>The torture videos were just one of the items allegedly
found in Cai’s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was
a diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate’s activities, but
sloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones,
police say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media
conversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.</p>
              <p>They were “an Aladdin’s Cave of intel,” said one AFP
commander based in North Asia.</p>
              <p>For at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly
travelled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for
the syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the
Drug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its
investigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip
from an international courier company recording the delivery of
two consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf
Chinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea
packets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had
been cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
              <p>Two days after Cai’s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon
address, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That
evening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon
jetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so,
Myanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but
other than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate,
including couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.</p>
              <p>Then came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery
of photos and videos on Cai’s phones, an AFP investigator based
in Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing
he had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier.
“This one stuck out because it was Canadian,” he recalled. “I
said: ‘Fuck, I know who you are!'”</p>
              <p>It was Tse Chi Lop.</p>
              <p>The Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of
intelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work
on Cai’s phones.</p>
              <p>Australia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime
gangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade,
the AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and
small, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent
described the database, which includes a trove of names,
chemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and
surveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence
on Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.</p>
              <p>The AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai’s
phones with the database. They discovered photos related to
three big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in
China, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators
and Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese
anti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and
addresses in Cai’s phones to other meth busts in China.</p>
              <p>For regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations
upended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by
different crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the
work of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics
agent said they believed Cai was “one of the members of a
mega-syndicate,” which had been involved in multiple “drugs
cases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.”</p>
              <p>Cai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still
in jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking
charges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to
contact Cai’s lawyer.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>METH PARADISE</p>
              <p>During his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing
the country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and
obtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a
bigger vessel in international waters, according to police and
the Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures
of the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where
the meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.</p>
              <p>The police reconstruction of Cai’s dealings in Myanmar led
to another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production
had shifted from China’s southern provinces to Shan State in
Myanmar’s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had
provided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor
ingredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were
smuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in
the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the
freedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.</p>
              <p>Armed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan
State have long controlled large tracts of territory and used
drug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the
military. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar
government with rebel groups over the years has brought relative
calm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to
flourish.</p>
              <p>“Production facilities can be hidden from law enforcement
and other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,”
analyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the
International Crisis Group. “Drug production and profits are now
so vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.”</p>
              <p>The Myanmar government and police did not respond to
questions from Reuters.</p>
              <p>Along the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there
is evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts
a deep ravine known as the “Valley of Death,” where ethnic
Kachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for
decades with Myanmar’s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past
trucks carrying building materials and workers.</p>
              <p>The Kaung Kha militia’s immaculate and expansive new
headquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green
hills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers
away, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved
out of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned
out vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba
tablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine.
When it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more
than 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg
of caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances
used in drug production.</p>
              <p>The Loikan facility was “very likely” to have been the
source of much of the Sam Gor syndicate’s meth, said the
Yangon-based AFP officer.</p>
              <p>“Some militia were involved in the lab,” said Oi Khun, a
communications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia,
in an interview. He paused, then added: “But not with the
knowledge of senior members” of the militia.</p>
              <p>One person in Loikan described how workers from the lab
would come down from the hills. The men, like most of the
villagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the
locals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.</p>
              <p>“I asked them once. ‘Why don’t you bathe?’” the person said.
“They said they did, but there was nothing they could do about
the smell.”</p>
              <p>The rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the
skin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature
stench might reveal their illicit activities. “We all knew,” the
person said. “We just didn’t talk about it. That just brings you
danger.”</p>
              <p>Meth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals,
say Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network’s
couriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the
Asia-Pacific.</p>
              <p>Shan’s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the
world, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told
Reuters. “They can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the
ground and let it dry.”</p>
              <p>The UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth
is worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business
model for meth is “very different” to heroin, said the UNODC’s
Douglas. “Inputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not
needed, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore
far, far higher.”</p>
              <p>The wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in
northeastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a
UNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control
Commission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to
the UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand,
$298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the
Japanese market, that’s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.</p>
              <p>The money the syndicate is making “means that if they lose
ten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,”
said the Chinese counter-narcotics official. “They can afford
failure. It doesn’t matter.”</p>
              <p/>
              <p>‘MONEY, MONEY’</p>
              <p>The analysis of Cai’s phones was continuing to provide
leads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the
pick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with
Myanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at
sea for weeks.</p>
              <p>One of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the
Shun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement
document reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea
when, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a
marine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and
paid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV
Valkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s
and hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea
sickness tablets. According to local media, he didn’t have a
fishing license at the time.</p>
              <p>After buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on
a course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in
the Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the
rendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western
Australian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was
seen “unloading a lot of packages” into a van, the commander
said.</p>
              <p>“We knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of
organized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and
comes back with some gear on it, that it hasn’t just dropped
from the sky in the middle of the ocean.”</p>
              <p>Investigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car
hire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug
traffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say,
that some of Smith’s alleged co-conspirators were members of an
ethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and
Comanchero motorcycle gangs, known as “bikies” in Australia.</p>
              <p>As they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of
crystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor
syndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy
of an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians
reconvened in Perth a month later.</p>
              <p>Bikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and
a self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had
refined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star
hotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police
investigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants,
said the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar &amp; Grill in Perth.
The restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that
included caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.</p>
              <p>On November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again,
this time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the
Andaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth
from Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast
of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the
Indian Ocean.</p>
              <p>The Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.</p>
              <p>When the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in
international waters off the West Australian coast on December
19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting “money, money,”
according to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De
Man’s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith
and his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved
their identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by
the crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.</p>
              <p>The Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of
Geraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The
men unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of
the AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault
weapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty
to importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of
his alleged associates are still on trial.</p>
              <p>Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it
had “worked together with our counterparts on the investigation”
of the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the “substantial
seizure of illicit narcotics” by the Australian authorities in
December 2017. The bureau said it was “aware that Taiwanese
syndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in
(the) Asia-Pacific region,” and was working “collaboratively and
closely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and
cross-border drug trafficking.”</p>
              <p/>
              <p>NIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED</p>
              <p>As the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police
concluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone
a kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the
three biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the
1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The
other two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse’s original triad, and the
Bamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator,
the syndicate’s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that
it “must rival Apple’s.”</p>
              <p>“The syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market
to tap,” said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior
colonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade.
“The power this network possesses is unimaginable.”</p>
              <p>Investigators have had wins. In February last year, police
busted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough
tea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66
was intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than
one tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor
lieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar.
In December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected
syndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.</p>
              <p>Located near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed
compound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used
to experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a
100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to
the back of the property.</p>
              <p>Sue wasn’t there, but property and money from 38 bank
accounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized
during the investigation. Sue is still at large.</p>
              <p>But the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the
wider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal
meth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and
Southeast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in
most countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising
seizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019,
“suggested the supply of the drug had expanded.”</p>
              <p>In the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive
adversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug
motherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product
in shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth
coming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the
syndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This
included deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each
containing about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on
narrow jungle paths.</p>
              <p>Over the years, police have had little success in taking
down Asia’s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders
have been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to
the AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics
kingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than
a short period was in the mid-1970s. That’s when Ng Sik-ho, a
wily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced
to 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium
and morphine, according to court records.</p>
              <p>So far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho’s fate. He is being
tracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say
counter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they
believe he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.</p>

By Tom Allard
BANGKOK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - He is Asia’s most-wanted man. He
is protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private
jet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night
at a Macau casino.
Tse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected
of leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate
formed out of an alliance of five of Asia’s triad groups,
according to law enforcement officials. Its members call it
simply “The Company.” Police, in a nod to one of Tse’s
nicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for “Brother Number
Three.”
The syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of
methamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen
countries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South
Pacific. But meth – a highly addictive drug with devastating
physical and mental effects on long-term users – is its main
business, they say.
In what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate’s
meth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be
as high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the
cartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a
40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has
expanded at least fourfold in the past five years.
This unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an
unprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the
prime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously
unreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the
Australian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about
20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far
the biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug
trafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in
the investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar,
China, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan,
while not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the
investigation.
A document containing AFP profiles of the operation’s top 19
syndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the
leader of the syndicate. According to the document, the
organization has “been connected with or directly involved in at
least 13 cases” of drug trafficking since January 2015. The
document does not provide specific details of the cases.
A Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the
“Multinational CEO” of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional
government agencies says Tse is “believed to be” the leader of
the Sam Gor syndicate.
Police have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected
boss of the trafficking group.
Some investigators say that the scope of the syndicate’s
operation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin
America’s most legendary narco-traffickers. “Tse Chi Lop is in
the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,” said Jeremy
Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC.
“The word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no
doubt it applies here.”
Reuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to
questions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan’s Ministry
of Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on
investigations.
During the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific
to uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This
included interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement
officials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence
reports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings
and other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in
Myanmar’s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia’s Golden
Triangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing
drugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited
the Thai compound of one of the syndicate’s alleged drug lords.
What emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly
transnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the
AFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often
refer to as “T1” - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong,
Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.
The syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and
sophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin
American cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies
a bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a
more diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels
do, including Japan’s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic
Chinese gangs across Southeast Asia.
The crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled
outbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police
say. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked
rivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a
united pursuit of gargantuan profits.
“The crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate
with seamless efficiency,” says one veteran Western anti-drugs
official. “They function like a global corporation.”
Like most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed,
the investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.
In addition to the contrasts between their drug operations,
there’s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop
and Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed
Mexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine
trafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their
extravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has
been revealed about Tse’s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug
lords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.

A TRIP, A TRAP
Tse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern
China, and grew up during China’s Cultural Revolution. Amid the
bloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group
of imprisoned members of Mao’s Red Guard in the southern city of
Guangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big
Circle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police,
and like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong
Kong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their
criminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.
In the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong,
Macau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based
in Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling
ring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless
opium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand,
China and Laos meet.
In 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on
drug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New
York. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into
America, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over
his head.
Through a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged
for leniency.
His ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His
12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed.
If freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed
“great sorrow” for his crime, court records show.
The entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to
nine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional
institution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.
After he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to
Canada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for
the next four years. It’s unclear when Tse returned to his old
haunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife
registered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company
Ltd, in Hong Kong in 2011.
Police suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He
“picked up where he left off,” said the senior AFP investigator.
Tse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and
the Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved
irresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his
drug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no
extra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.
His policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for
business, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011,
AFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and
meth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather
than arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under
surveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely
for more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug
cell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They
wanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.
The syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other
drug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and
selling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the
syndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the
Melbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police
watched the Australian meet two men.
One of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted
hair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese
family man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance
showed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal
security. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of
Thai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eight
worked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as
part of his security protocol.
Tse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts
and five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in
private jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand
for a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt,
according to a member of the task force investigating the
syndicate.
Tse was a frequent visitor to Asia’s casinos and fond of
betting on horses, especially on English races. “We believe he
lost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the
tables in Macau,” said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.
As the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected
that the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia
with meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA,
commonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the
Sam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say,
when a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of
white powder strapped to each of his thighs.

‘ALADDIN’S CAVE OF INTEL’
Cai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the
airport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It
was the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous,
picking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said
a former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation.
“His hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,” the
commander told Reuters. “Methamphetamine is very toxic.”
Cai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs
was a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful
tranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. “We were very
fortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,” the
commander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been
monitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police
had no idea who he was.
Cai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a
“pesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,” according to
Myanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A
friend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father.
Cai’s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for
ketamine at the airport, the commander said.
Unimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight.
The next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport.
One recognized him from surveillance work he’d been conducting.
Still, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they
later found on one of his phones might have explained his
silence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least
three assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch
and electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said
one investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy
saying “Loyalty to the Heavens.” The banner was a “triad-related
sign,” he added.
The tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed
the video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat
because he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a
law enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of
the victim’s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad
members were sending a message about the price of disloyalty,
the officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.
The torture videos were just one of the items allegedly
found in Cai’s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was
a diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate’s activities, but
sloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones,
police say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media
conversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.
They were “an Aladdin’s Cave of intel,” said one AFP
commander based in North Asia.
For at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly
travelled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for
the syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the
Drug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its
investigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip
from an international courier company recording the delivery of
two consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf
Chinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea
packets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had
been cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.
Two days after Cai’s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon
address, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That
evening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon
jetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so,
Myanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but
other than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate,
including couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.
Then came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery
of photos and videos on Cai’s phones, an AFP investigator based
in Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing
he had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier.
“This one stuck out because it was Canadian,” he recalled. “I
said: ‘Fuck, I know who you are!'”
It was Tse Chi Lop.
The Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of
intelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work
on Cai’s phones.
Australia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime
gangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade,
the AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and
small, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent
described the database, which includes a trove of names,
chemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and
surveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence
on Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.
The AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai’s
phones with the database. They discovered photos related to
three big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in
China, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators
and Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese
anti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and
addresses in Cai’s phones to other meth busts in China.
For regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations
upended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by
different crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the
work of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics
agent said they believed Cai was “one of the members of a
mega-syndicate,” which had been involved in multiple “drugs
cases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.”
Cai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still
in jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking
charges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to
contact Cai’s lawyer.

METH PARADISE
During his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing
the country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and
obtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a
bigger vessel in international waters, according to police and
the Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures
of the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where
the meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.
The police reconstruction of Cai’s dealings in Myanmar led
to another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production
had shifted from China’s southern provinces to Shan State in
Myanmar’s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had
provided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor
ingredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were
smuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in
the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the
freedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.
Armed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan
State have long controlled large tracts of territory and used
drug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the
military. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar
government with rebel groups over the years has brought relative
calm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to
flourish.
“Production facilities can be hidden from law enforcement
and other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,”
analyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the
International Crisis Group. “Drug production and profits are now
so vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.”
The Myanmar government and police did not respond to
questions from Reuters.
Along the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there
is evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts
a deep ravine known as the “Valley of Death,” where ethnic
Kachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for
decades with Myanmar’s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past
trucks carrying building materials and workers.
The Kaung Kha militia’s immaculate and expansive new
headquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green
hills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers
away, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved
out of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned
out vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba
tablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine.
When it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more
than 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg
of caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances
used in drug production.
The Loikan facility was “very likely” to have been the
source of much of the Sam Gor syndicate’s meth, said the
Yangon-based AFP officer.
“Some militia were involved in the lab,” said Oi Khun, a
communications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia,
in an interview. He paused, then added: “But not with the
knowledge of senior members” of the militia.
One person in Loikan described how workers from the lab
would come down from the hills. The men, like most of the
villagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the
locals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.
“I asked them once. ‘Why don’t you bathe?’” the person said.
“They said they did, but there was nothing they could do about
the smell.”
The rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the
skin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature
stench might reveal their illicit activities. “We all knew,” the
person said. “We just didn’t talk about it. That just brings you
danger.”
Meth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals,
say Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network’s
couriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the
Asia-Pacific.
Shan’s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the
world, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told
Reuters. “They can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the
ground and let it dry.”
The UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth
is worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business
model for meth is “very different” to heroin, said the UNODC’s
Douglas. “Inputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not
needed, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore
far, far higher.”
The wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in
northeastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a
UNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control
Commission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to
the UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand,
$298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the
Japanese market, that’s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.
The money the syndicate is making “means that if they lose
ten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,”
said the Chinese counter-narcotics official. “They can afford
failure. It doesn’t matter.”

‘MONEY, MONEY’
The analysis of Cai’s phones was continuing to provide
leads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the
pick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with
Myanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at
sea for weeks.
One of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the
Shun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement
document reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea
when, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a
marine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and
paid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV
Valkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s
and hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea
sickness tablets. According to local media, he didn’t have a
fishing license at the time.
After buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on
a course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in
the Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the
rendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western
Australian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was
seen “unloading a lot of packages” into a van, the commander
said.
“We knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of
organized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and
comes back with some gear on it, that it hasn’t just dropped
from the sky in the middle of the ocean.”
Investigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car
hire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug
traffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say,
that some of Smith’s alleged co-conspirators were members of an
ethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and
Comanchero motorcycle gangs, known as “bikies” in Australia.
As they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of
crystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor
syndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy
of an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians
reconvened in Perth a month later.
Bikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and
a self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had
refined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star
hotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police
investigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants,
said the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth.
The restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that
included caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.
On November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again,
this time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the
Andaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth
from Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast
of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the
Indian Ocean.
The Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.
When the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in
international waters off the West Australian coast on December
19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting “money, money,”
according to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De
Man’s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith
and his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved
their identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by
the crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.
The Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of
Geraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The
men unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of
the AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault
weapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty
to importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of
his alleged associates are still on trial.
Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it
had “worked together with our counterparts on the investigation”
of the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the “substantial
seizure of illicit narcotics” by the Australian authorities in
December 2017. The bureau said it was “aware that Taiwanese
syndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in
(the) Asia-Pacific region,” and was working “collaboratively and
closely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and
cross-border drug trafficking.”

NIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED
As the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police
concluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone
a kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the
three biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the
1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The
other two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse’s original triad, and the
Bamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator,
the syndicate’s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that
it “must rival Apple’s.”
“The syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market
to tap,” said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior
colonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade.
“The power this network possesses is unimaginable.”
Investigators have had wins. In February last year, police
busted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough
tea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66
was intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than
one tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor
lieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar.
In December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected
syndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.
Located near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed
compound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used
to experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a
100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to
the back of the property.
Sue wasn’t there, but property and money from 38 bank
accounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized
during the investigation. Sue is still at large.
But the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the
wider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal
meth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and
Southeast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in
most countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising
seizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019,
“suggested the supply of the drug had expanded.”
In the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive
adversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug
motherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product
in shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth
coming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the
syndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This
included deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each
containing about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on
narrow jungle paths.
Over the years, police have had little success in taking
down Asia’s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders
have been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to
the AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics
kingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than
a short period was in the mid-1970s. That’s when Ng Sik-ho, a
wily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced
to 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium
and morphine, according to court records.
So far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho’s fate. He is being
tracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say
counter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they
believe he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.

              <p>ROME, Oct 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Farmers around
the world are losing up to 20% of the food they produce every
year but action can be taken to reduce this, according to the
United Nations on Monday as it quantified such losses for the
first time.</p>
              <p>A combination of causes, ranging from harvesting and
handling practices, to lack of infrastructure and market prices
to pests, diseases and climatic conditions, contributed to these
losses, said the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).</p>
              <p>This ""means that land and water resources have been wasted,
pollution created and greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted to no
purpose"", said FAO Director-General Qu Dongyu in a report
released ahead of World Food Day on Oct. 16.</p>
              <p>An earlier, widely-cited figure estimated about a third of
the world's food - about 1.3 billion tonnes - was lost or wasted
annually but that was a rough figure including estimates for
losses along the whole supply chain, according to the FAO.</p>
              <p>The FAO said the latest numbers, which showed 14% losses
globally, focused on losses between harvest and markets and
showed variations among the world's regions and commodities.</p>
              <p>Central and southern Asia have the highest level of food
losses of 20% followed by northern America and Europe at more
than 15%. Australia and New Zealand have the lowest at about 6%.</p>
              <p>""This number is important because now we can measure the
effects of different policies to reduce losses and we can track
it over time to see if we're improving or not,"" said the FAO's
Assistant Director-General Maximo Torero Cullen.</p>
              <p>With the right policies the world ""can eliminate a
significant amount of that 14% food loss"" but this had costs and
depended on lawmakers, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p>""Reductions in the early stages of the food supply chain is
most effective in addressing food security or natural resources
stress, but reduction of food waste by consumers and retailers
is the best to reduce GHG emissions,"" he added.</p>
              <p>The findings show losses of one in four roots, tubers and
oil-bearing crops, such as cassava and potatoes, and more than
one in five fruits and vegetables, but less than 10% in cereals
and pulses.</p>
              <p>Slashing these losses on the farm could increase food
availability for small-scale farmers in low-income countries who
might also make money selling the surplus, but a glut in produce
could depress prices as well as demand, the report warned.</p>
              <p>Also some losses were easier to address than others. Making
air-conditioned storage available in rural locations without
proper roads or electricity would take time but others might
only require small adjustments, Torero Cullen said.</p>
              <p>For example in Ghana, switching from conventional bags to
triple-layer bags with an air-tight seal can protect cassava
chips and maize from insects and fungus, according to
Washington-based International Food Policy Research Institute.</p>
              <p>New technologies could also help. California-based start-up
Apeel Sciences produces a plant-based coating that comes in
powder form and, when applied with water, can double the shelf

              <p>It is being tested on mangoes and cassava in Africa.</p>
              <p>""Our hope is that with better information and better quality

              <p>By Hyonhee Shin</p>
              <p>SEOUL, Oct 13 (Reuters) - South Korea's prime minister plans
to visit Japan next week in what would be the highest-level trip
since Japan imposed export curbs in a deepening trade and
diplomatic row, officials said on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Lee Nak-yon, whose trip is scheduled for Oct. 22-24, will
attend Japanese Emperor Naruhito's enthronement ceremony, Lee's
office said in a statement.</p>
              <p>Lee is expected to take part in a banquet hosted by Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday, and hold separate talks with
him, which would mark the highest-level dialogue since tension
flared up last year over the issue of Japan's wartime use of
South Korean forced labour, officials said.</p>
              <p>""We hope his visit would help, as both sides share
understanding that we continue dialogue to improve relations,"" a
government official said on condition of anonymity due to the
sensitivity of the ties.</p>
              <p>Relations between the neighbours are arguably at their
lowest ebb since they normalised ties in 1965, after South
Korea's Supreme Court last year ordered two Japanese companies
to compensate some wartime labourers.</p>
              <p>Japan says the issue was settled under a 1965 treaty that
normalised ties.</p>
              <p>The dispute has since spilled over into trade and security,
with Japan slapping export curbs and South Korea scrapping a
bilateral intelligence-sharing pact.</p>
              <p>Abe and Lee, a former journalist with a stint as Japan
correspondent, have built a rapport since their days as
politicians and last met during an international forum in Russia
in September 2018.

SEOUL, Oct 13 (Reuters) - South Korea's prime minister plans
to visit Japan next week in what would be the highest-level trip
since Japan imposed export curbs in a deepening trade and
diplomatic row, officials said on Sunday.
Lee Nak-yon, whose trip is scheduled for Oct. 22-24, will
attend Japanese Emperor Naruhito's enthronement ceremony, Lee's
office said in a statement.
Lee is expected to take part in a banquet hosted by Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday, and hold separate talks with
him, which would mark the highest-level dialogue since tension
flared up last year over the issue of Japan's wartime use of
South Korean forced labour, officials said.
""We hope his visit would help, as both sides share
understanding that we continue dialogue to improve relations,"" a
government official said on condition of anonymity due to the
sensitivity of the ties.
Relations between the neighbours are arguably at their
lowest ebb since they normalised ties in 1965, after South
Korea's Supreme Court last year ordered two Japanese companies
to compensate some wartime labourers.
Japan says the issue was settled under a 1965 treaty that
normalised ties.
The dispute has since spilled over into trade and security,
with Japan slapping export curbs and South Korea scrapping a
bilateral intelligence-sharing pact.
Abe and Lee, a former journalist with a stint as Japan
correspondent, have built a rapport since their days as
politicians and last met during an international forum in Russia
in September 2018.

survivor finished a more than 700 kilometer walk on Saturday

              <p>Leilani Kuter walked 27 kilometers for 27 days to mark 27
years since she survived a brutal rape, raising money along the

45-year-old.</p>
              <p>After being violently raped in 1992 and left for dead, Kuter
went on to start a successful marketing agency and a dating

              <p>""I numbed my pain for so many years,"" Kuter told the Thomson

              <p>Women in South Africa, a nation with a history of violence
and profound inequality, have endured a spate of rapes,
kidnappings and murders in recent years.</p>
              <p>Around 3,000 women were murdered in 2018 - around one every
three hours - which is more than five times higher than the

              <p>Kuter crossed five South African provinces and was joined

parents of children killed in violent crimes.</p>
              <p>""I feel exhausted but happy. There is not one emotion I have
not experienced,"" she said.</p>
              <p>While walking across the country she dressed in yellow, the

              <p>Kuter said she raised around 200,000 rand ($13,000) for
counselling and emergency comfort packs for rape survivors.</p>

              <p>COPENHAGEN, Oct 11 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Young
activists demonstrating across the world are driving cities to
step up action on climate change, not least because politicians
keep coming face-to-face with them while going about their
business, mayors at a climate conference heard Friday.</p>
              <p>As activists from Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg to
""Extinction Rebellion"" movement protesters take an increasingly
visible stand on climate change, officials feel growing
pressure to respond, mayors gathered in Copenhagen said.</p>
              <p>""If you want to walk the streets of some of the biggest
cities in Poland, you've got to do something about climate
change,"" Warsaw's mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski, told the C40 summit
of mayors committed to action on climate change.</p>
              <p>""The pressure especially from young people is just
enormous,"" he said. ""They are fed up with declarations, with
goals and priorities ... they want to see results"".</p>
              <p>Leaders of more than 90 cities representing more than 700
million people and a quarter of the global economy met in the
Danish capital this week to push for faster action to stem
climate threats.</p>
              <p>The gathering came as Extinction Rebellion climate change
activists took to the streets from London to New Zealand for two
weeks of peaceful civil disobedience.</p>
              <p>""Mayors are on the frontline now,"" former U.S. vice
president Al Gore told the conference. ""You do not have the
luxury of just going away and reading reports about what is
going on. You run into your constituents every single day.""</p>
              <p>On Thursday Extinction Rebellion protesters attempted to
shut down London City Airport, with one protester laying on top
of a plane. On Friday they blocked the headquarters of the BBC,
Britain's public service broadcaster..</p>
              <p>Earlier this week, French members of the movement blocked a
street and bridge in Paris' Chatelet district.</p>
              <p>The city's mayor, Anne Hidalgo, said she shared their
concern.</p>
              <p>""We are facing threats of climate breakdown – the response
that we're seeing from Extinction Rebellion and young climate
strikers around the globe should come as no surprise,"" she said.</p>
              <p>In Copenhagen, city leaders unveiled a series of pledges and
measures to cut planet warming emissions, from reducing meat
consumption to tackling air pollution with cheap bus fares and
vehicle bans.</p>
              <p>But delegates at the summit opening Wednesday were met by
demonstrators from Klima Aktion DK, a local climate action
group, armed with fake binoculars made from toilet rolls.</p>
              <p>""Our message to the C40 Mayors is: The people are watching
you! We want to see action!"" the group wrote on Facebook.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>EMPTY WORDS</p>
              <p>Cities are vital to limit global warming as they account for
about three-quarters of carbon emissions and consume more than
two-thirds of global energy, according to the United Nations.</p>
              <p>Wider use of existing clean technologies - such as electric
buses - could deliver more than half the cuts needed to keep
global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees
Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the U.N. says.</p>
              <p>World leaders agreed in the 2015 Paris Agreement to hold
temperate hikes to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius.</p>
              <p>""Cities are where the climate battle will largely be won or
lost,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the
Copenhagen summit.</p>
              <p>Youth activists invited to the meeting to discuss possible
climate measures demanded a bigger seat at the table and called
for stronger action.</p>
              <p>""We should be a part of the decision process when decisions
regarding our future are being taken,"" said Selma Norgard, a
young Danish climate activist.</p>
              <p>Luisa Neubauer, a founder of the German branch of Fridays
for Future, the movement started by Thunberg, said her 10 months
of activism on climate change had taught her to distrust
politicians.</p>
              <p>""We have become experts in listening to empty words and to
hearing empty promises over and over again. That is painful,""
she said.</p>
              <p>""We just ask to grow old on a planet that can provide
livelihoods for all of us, no matter where we are born"".</p>
              <p>Hilda Nakabuye, the founder of Fridays for Future in Uganda,
said her family had been forced to sell of its land and
livestock as heavy rains, high winds and dry spells linked to
climate change had wiped away crops and made the soil barren.</p>
              <p>""Your beds might be comfortable right now but not for long.
You'll soon feel the same heat that we feel every day,"" she
warned.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>NO MAGIC WAND</p>
              <p>Many mayors in attendance said they were inspired by the
resolve shown by young activists - and somewhat surprised by the
rapid growth of their movement.</p>
              <p>Milan's mayor, Giuseppe Sala, said the city council was
planning to consult young people in climate matters.</p>
              <p>But translating ideas into concrete action was not always
easy, as not everybody agrees on what should be done, said the

COPENHAGEN, Oct 11 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Young
activists demonstrating across the world are driving cities to
step up action on climate change, not least because politicians
keep coming face-to-face with them while going about their
business, mayors at a climate conference heard Friday.
As activists from Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg to
""Extinction Rebellion"" movement protesters take an increasingly
visible stand on climate change, officials feel growing
pressure to respond, mayors gathered in Copenhagen said.
""If you want to walk the streets of some of the biggest
cities in Poland, you've got to do something about climate
change,"" Warsaw's mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski, told the C40 summit
of mayors committed to action on climate change.
""The pressure especially from young people is just
enormous,"" he said. ""They are fed up with declarations, with
goals and priorities ... they want to see results"".
Leaders of more than 90 cities representing more than 700
million people and a quarter of the global economy met in the
Danish capital this week to push for faster action to stem
climate threats.
The gathering came as Extinction Rebellion climate change
activists took to the streets from London to New Zealand for two
weeks of peaceful civil disobedience.
""Mayors are on the frontline now,"" former U.S. vice
president Al Gore told the conference. ""You do not have the
luxury of just going away and reading reports about what is
going on. You run into your constituents every single day.""
On Thursday Extinction Rebellion protesters attempted to
shut down London City Airport, with one protester laying on top
of a plane. On Friday they blocked the headquarters of the BBC,
Britain's public service broadcaster..
Earlier this week, French members of the movement blocked a
street and bridge in Paris' Chatelet district.
The city's mayor, Anne Hidalgo, said she shared their
concern.
""We are facing threats of climate breakdown – the response
that we're seeing from Extinction Rebellion and young climate
strikers around the globe should come as no surprise,"" she said.
In Copenhagen, city leaders unveiled a series of pledges and
measures to cut planet warming emissions, from reducing meat
consumption to tackling air pollution with cheap bus fares and
vehicle bans.
But delegates at the summit opening Wednesday were met by
demonstrators from Klima Aktion DK, a local climate action
group, armed with fake binoculars made from toilet rolls.
""Our message to the C40 Mayors is: The people are watching
you! We want to see action!"" the group wrote on Facebook.

EMPTY WORDS
Cities are vital to limit global warming as they account for
about three-quarters of carbon emissions and consume more than
two-thirds of global energy, according to the United Nations.
Wider use of existing clean technologies - such as electric
buses - could deliver more than half the cuts needed to keep
global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees
Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the U.N. says.
World leaders agreed in the 2015 Paris Agreement to hold
temperate hikes to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius.
""Cities are where the climate battle will largely be won or
lost,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the
Copenhagen summit.
Youth activists invited to the meeting to discuss possible
climate measures demanded a bigger seat at the table and called
for stronger action.
""We should be a part of the decision process when decisions
regarding our future are being taken,"" said Selma Norgard, a
young Danish climate activist.
Luisa Neubauer, a founder of the German branch of Fridays
for Future, the movement started by Thunberg, said her 10 months
of activism on climate change had taught her to distrust
politicians.
""We have become experts in listening to empty words and to
hearing empty promises over and over again. That is painful,""
she said.
""We just ask to grow old on a planet that can provide
livelihoods for all of us, no matter where we are born"".
Hilda Nakabuye, the founder of Fridays for Future in Uganda,
said her family had been forced to sell of its land and
livestock as heavy rains, high winds and dry spells linked to
climate change had wiped away crops and made the soil barren.
""Your beds might be comfortable right now but not for long.
You'll soon feel the same heat that we feel every day,"" she
warned.

NO MAGIC WAND
Many mayors in attendance said they were inspired by the
resolve shown by young activists - and somewhat surprised by the
rapid growth of their movement.
Milan's mayor, Giuseppe Sala, said the city council was
planning to consult young people in climate matters.
But translating ideas into concrete action was not always
easy, as not everybody agrees on what should be done, said the
mayor of Lisbon, Fernando Medina.
Even simple measures such as creating more cycle lanes often
face opposition from residents and politicians when, for
example, they encroach on parking spaces, he said.
""I don't have a magic wand,"" he said. ""But I can tell (young
people) that I can work every day to make things happen more
quickly"".
Others lamented that cities alone could not solve the
climate crisis.
""Cities are leading the change, but countries need to do
their part too,"" said the mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau.
At least 70 countries announced plans at a U.N. climate
action summit last month to boost their effors to cut emissions,
but most major economies, including the United States and China,
failed to announce stronger new measures.
The world is now at a crossroads between ""extinction or
opportunity"", said U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a
Democratic member of Congress.
""Every decision we make between now and (within) our
children's lifetimes will determine how human life will fare,
whether we'll suffer greatly or build together,"" she told the
summit.

              <p>DAKAR, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Propelled to
fashion fame by Beyonce, an African clothing designer plans to
expand production in Senegal and train local tailors to
translate her brand's success into jobs, she said.</p>
              <p>Sarah Diouf's Tongoro designs gained an international
following after the superstar wore her patterned dresses and
wide-leg pants on vacation in Italy last year, causing sales to
nearly triple.</p>
              <p>The 31-year-old was then asked to make a custom design for
Beyonce, who wore a Tongoro suit and dressed her dancers in its
jewellery in her ""Spirit"" music video for ""The Lion King"" film.</p>
              <p>R&amp;B singer Alicia Keys and British model Naomi Campbell have
also been spotted in Tongoro, whose pieces are sold online for
about 200 euros ($220).</p>
              <p>But rising demand for ""Made in Africa"" fashion has not yet
benefited many people at home, said Diouf, who employs only
seven tailors so far. With more local training and online sales,
she thinks Senegal's nascent clothing industry can grow.</p>
              <p>""We have so much talent, but I think we just need a little
bit more structure to take it to the next level,"" said Diouf in
an interview in the Senegalese capital, Dakar.</p>
              <p>""For me, the Beyonce storyline is opening the conversation
and opening doors.""</p>
              <p>Diouf started her brand in 2016 after going back and forth
between Dakar and Paris and realising that her friends in France
were eager to buy the clothes she had made in Senegal.</p>
              <p>Dakar is known for its vibrant fashion scene but most
tailors are self-taught, work on street corners and have no way
to reach a wider customer base.</p>
              <p>After Tongoro was featured in Elle and Vogue magazines,
Diouf recognised its potential to sell worldwide. She plans to
scale up next year and eventually open a production facility
with 100 to 150 tailors.</p>
              <p>""I feel like, for so long, everything that comes from Africa
has been associated with bad quality,"" she said.</p>
              <p>""It was important for me to push that narrative forward, to
say, you can actually buy something from Africa that is not
cliche ... but something that can be modern and youthful.""</p>
              <p>The challenges are big. Senegalese tailors are not used to
producing en masse, and selling clothes online is a relatively
new idea for locals, said Diouf.</p>
              <p>If more African businesses embraced e-commerce it could be a
game-changer for expanding their reach, she said.</p>
              <p>""In Dakar there are more and more emerging brands,"" said
Diouf. ""I think with the new generation, especially because
we're more keen on digital, things are slowly changing.""</p>
              <p>Her biggest markets are currently Nigeria, South Africa and
Ghana but she hopes to lower prices as the company grows and
become an African version of Zara, the giant Spanish chain.</p>
              <p>""To scale, I will have to invest in training. I think this
is the next challenge for 'Made in Africa',"" she said.</p>
              <p>""We have a lot of artisans with great skills and talent, but
when it comes to scale we cannot afford to have one item not
looking alike.""</p>

              <p>The U.N. chief told a gathering of world mayors in

              <p>""Climate change is moving faster than we are, exceeding
worst-case projections,"" he added.</p>
              <p>Countries should cut their planet-warming emissions by at

stabilise warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7F) above

countries in the 2015 Paris Agreement, he said.</p>
              <p>But government action was lagging behind, Guterres added.</p>
              <p>""Current national climate action plans get us nowhere close

              <p>At least 70 countries announced plans at a U.N. climate
action summit last month to beef up their Paris pledges to cut
emissions, but most major economies including the United States
and China failed to announce stronger new measures.</p>
              <p>""We still have large parts of the world with a coal

COPENHAGEN, Oct 11 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From
penalising cars to planting trees, dozens of mayors from every
continent pledged cleaner air on Friday in a bid to improve
urban health and tackle climate change.
More than 90% of people breathe dirty air, causing death and
disease, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
""This dirty air kills 7 million people a year, largely in
cities, and contributes to the global climate emergency,"" United
Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the C40 summit
of world mayors in Copenhagen.
Leaders of more than 90 cities representing more than 700
million people and a quarter of the global economy met in the
Danish capital this week to push climate action.
As activists from Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg to the
""Extinction Rebellion"" protest movement take an increasingly
visible stand on climate change, officialdom is catching up.
Among the mayoral initiatives are incentives to 'do good' -
cheap bus fares - and penalties for doing harm - such as spewing
excess emissions - as cities test tactics to coax change.
From Los Angeles to Tokyo, 35 cities committed on Friday to
meet WHO minimum air quality levels by 2030 - something they
said could save 40,000 lives a year - and report on progress.
""Toxic air pollution is a global crisis, and as mayors, it

The mayors met in the Danish capital- a Viking village
turned city of wind turbines - days after climate-change
protesters took to the streets from Austria to New Zealand
pledging two weeks of peaceful civil disobedience.
Delegates at the summit opening were met on Wednesday by
demonstrators from local group Klima Aktion DK, armed with fake
binoculars made from toilet rolls.
""Our message to the C40 Mayors is: The people are watching
you! We want to see action!"" the group wrote on Facebook.

LONDON TO LISBON
More than 2 million people live in areas of London that have
illegally high levels of air toxins, according to official data.
To change that, the city this year introduced the world's
first Ultra Low Emission Zone, requiring all vehicles to meet
strict standards or pay a fee to enter the centre, Khan said.
Others offered carrots instead of sticks.
The mayor of Lisbon, Fernando Medina, said the Portuguese
capital launched a discounted single fare ticket in April that
had already resulted in a 30% increase in public transport use.
It has also increased green spaces, he said, with the
equivalent of some 200 football pitches newly planted.
Milan's Mayor Giuseppe Sala said the Italian city was
implementing a large low-emission zone and planned to completely
switch its bus fleet to electric within seven years.
""Politically it is not easy to tell people they can't use

pollution levels and planned to ban all diesel vehicles from
Paris by 2024 and all fuel cars by 2040.
""The era of toxic emissions that poison the air we all

COPENHAGEN, Oct 11 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From
penalising cars to planting trees, dozens of mayors from every
continent pledged cleaner air on Friday in a bid to improve
urban health and tackle climate change.
More than 90% of people breathe dirty air, causing death and
disease, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
""This dirty air kills 7 million people a year, largely in
cities, and contributes to the global climate emergency,"" United
Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the C40 summit
of world mayors in Copenhagen.
Leaders of more than 90 cities representing more than 700
million people and a quarter of the global economy met in the
Danish capital this week to push climate action.
As activists from Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg to the
""Extinction Rebellion"" protest movement take an increasingly
visible stand on climate change, officialdom is catching up.
Among the mayoral initiatives are incentives to 'do good' -
cheap bus fares - and penalties for doing harm - such as spewing
excess emissions - as cities test tactics to coax change.
From Los Angeles to Tokyo, 34 cities committed on Friday to
meet WHO minimum air quality levels by 2030 - something they
said could save 40,000 lives a year - and report on progress.
""Air pollution is a global crisis, and as mayors, it is our
fundamental responsibility to protect our citizens from the
dangerous health implications associated with breathing dirty
air,"" said Mayor of London Sadiq Khan.
The mayors met in the Danish capital- a Viking village
turned city of wind turbines - days after climate-change
protesters took to the streets from Austria to New Zealand
pledging two weeks of peaceful civil disobedience.
Delegates at the summit opening were met on Wednesday by
demonstrators from local group Klima Aktion DK, armed with fake
binoculars made from toilet rolls.
""Our message to the C40 Mayors is: The people are watching
you! We want to see action!"" the group wrote on Facebook.

LONDON TO LISBON
More than 2 million people live in areas of London that have
illegally high levels of air toxins, according to official data.
To change that, the city this year introduced the world's
first Ultra Low Emission Zone, requiring all vehicles to meet
strict standards or pay a fee to enter the centre, Khan said.
Others offered carrots instead of sticks.
The mayor of Lisbon, Fernando Medina, said the Portuguese
capital launched a discounted single fare ticket in April that
had already resulted in a 30% increase in public transport use.
It has also increased green spaces, he said, with the
equivalent of some 200 football pitches newly planted.
Milan's Mayor Giuseppe Sala said the Italian city was
implementing a large low-emission zone and planned to completely
switch its bus fleet to electric within seven years.
""Politically it is not easy to tell people they can't use
their car but at this moment it is necessary,"" Sala told the
Thomson Reuters Foundation on the sidelines of the conference.
Cities are vital to limit global warming as they account for
about three-quarters of carbon emissions and consume more than
two-thirds of global energy, according to the United Nations.
Known technologies such as electric buses could deliver more
than half the cuts needed to keep global temperature rises below
2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the U.N. says.
""Bold and ambitious climate action has the added benefit of
reducing harmful pollution and cleaning the air we breathe,""
said the mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti.

              <p>The Houthi movement in control of Yemen's capital on
Thursday offered the internationally recognized Yemeni
government a prisoner swap involving 2,000 detainees after the
group unilaterally freed hundreds of prisoners last month. It
was the latest gesture toward easing tensions by the
Iran-aligned Houthis who have for over four years been battling
a Saudi-led military coalition loyal to the Yemeni government
that was ousted from power in the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014.</p>

Thousands flee, hundreds reported dead in Turkish attack on
U.S.-allied Kurds in Syria
Turkey pounded Kurdish militia in northeast Syria for a
second day on Thursday, forcing tens of thousands of people to
flee and killing at least dozens of people in a cross-border
assault on U.S. allies that has turned the Washington
establishment against President Donald Trump. The offensive
against the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) led by Kurdish YPG
militia, which began days after Trump pulled U.S. troops out of
the way and following a phone call with Turkish President Tayyip
Erdogan, opens one of the biggest new fronts in years in an
eight-year-old civil war that has drawn in global powers.
India's Modi and China's Xi eye new border security steps in
summit talks
Chinese President Xi Jinping and India's Prime Minister
Narendra Modi are expected to agree new security measures along
their unsettled border during a summit on Friday, officials
said, in an effort to smooth ties ruffled by differences over
Kashmir. The two are meeting in a seaside resort in southern
India after weeks of jousting over India's decision to revoke
the special status of its part of the disputed Himalayan
territory of Kashmir, angering arch-rival Pakistan and its ally
China.
Migrant protesters occupy U.S.-Mexico border bridge,
crossing closed
Migrants seeking asylum in the United States who are camped
in a dangerous Mexican border town occupied a bridge to
Brownsville, Texas on Thursday, leading U.S. authorities to
close the crossing, witnesses and authorities said.  Hundreds of
the migrants have been sleeping for weeks on the end of the
bridge in Matamoros, Mexico, a city known for gang violence and
for cartels that control human trafficking.
Giuliani associates charged with illegally funneling cash to
pro-Trump group
Two foreign-born Florida businessmen who have helped
President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani
investigate political rival Joe Biden were arrested in a scheme
to illegally funnel money to a pro-Trump election committee and
other U.S. political candidates, prosecutors said on Thursday.
The arrest of Ukraine-born Lev Parnas and Belarus-born Igor
Fruman at an airport outside Washington carrying one-way tickets
to Vienna was the latest dramatic development in a political
saga that threatens Trump's presidency.
Iraq appoints two new ministers after PM promises sweeping
reform
Iraq appointed new education and health ministers on
Thursday, a day after Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi promised
to reshuffle his government and enact reforms to try to stem
unrest. Suha Khalil is one of few women to have become a
minister in Iraq. Her appointment was approved by parliament,
which also voted for the appointment of the new health minister,
Jaafar Allawi, after his predecessor quit before the wave of
unrest.
Hungary urges EU dialogue with Turkey to prevent new wave of
migrants
The European Union should have a dialogue with Turkey
despite Ankara's offensive on Kurdish-led forces in Syria, in
order to avoid a fresh wave of migrants coming to Europe,
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Thursday.
Turkish troops and their Syrian rebel allies pushed further into
Syrian territory on Thursday, opening up a new front in the
Syrian civil war and exposing Europe's inability to influence
the direction of the conflict.
Yemen's Houthis offer Saudi-backed government new prisoner

              <p>KENDAL, England, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -
I conic gay artist Tom of Finland was an early fighter for LGBT+
rights, preparing a generation of gay men in the 1940s and '50s
to become activists who would fight for equality a decade later,
the founder of the illustrator's foundation said on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Tom's images of burly, leather-clad moustachioed muscle men
marked a ""radical shift"" from the then-prevailing idea of gay
men as limp-wristed fops hiding in the shadows, said Durk
Dehner, who set up the Tom of Finland Foundation with the artist
in 1984.</p>
              <p>""He was the forerunner of getting us prepared to be gay
liberationists,"" Dehner told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on
Thursday of the artist whose real name was Touko Laaksonen.</p>
              <p>""No matter what the sexual orientation of the people who
view his work, what they come away with is a sense of feeling
good about life and feeling good about being humans being sexual
in their nature,"" he added.</p>
              <p>Born in southwestern Finland in 1920, Tom was widely
7embraced by LGBT+ culture in the 1970s and 80s, although some
critics dismissed him as a mere cartoonist or illustrator.</p>
              <p>Photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, also known for the
graphically homoerotic nature of his work, was an early
supporter. Having met Tom in San Francisco, he helped stage an
exhibition of his works in 1980.</p>
              <p>While Dehner said Mapplethorpe was known for being
difficult, he played a critical role in persuading fellow fine
artists to accept Tom as one of their own.</p>
              <p>""(Mapplethorpe) was one of the first to move Tom over to
contemporary art facilities,"" Dehner said. ""Prior to that we had
been using gay or alternative galleries.""</p>
              <p>Speaking at an exhibit of Tom's work at Cross Lane Projects
in the northern English town of Kendal, Dehner, dressed in
leather  - jeans, jacket and tie - was visibly moved as he
looked back on his years as Tom's friend, lover and muse.</p>
              <p>""He's been gone now for 30 years,"" he reflected. ""But he's
in my life everyday.""</p>
              <p>Dehner, who said he turned down an offer from screen idol
Rock Hudson to be his boyfriend, spent his childhood in Alberta,
Canada before following the hippie dream and moving to
California in 1977.</p>
              <p>With a wry laugh, he noted ""And I'm stuck in LA - which was
the super-capital of plastic!""</p>
              <p>But he said life in Laurel Canyon brought benefits. ""I got
to listen to James Taylor and Carole King compose music every
morning when they lived one street up from us.""</p>
              <p/>
              <p>SPIRITUAL MATTERS</p>
              <p>The language of transcendental meditation still informs much
of Dehner's speech, with talk moving from sex and the leather
aesthetic to more spiritual matters and personal beliefs.</p>
              <p>Dehner, who worked as a male model, was photographed by star
photographer Bruce Weber and won access to ""the sort of elite
gays"" in 1970s and '80s New York.</p>
              <p>""The first exhibition I arranged for Tom was in the Village
in New York in 1979. It was at a place called Stompers which was
an alternative gallery, and both Robert (Mapplethorpe) and Andy
(Warhol) came to that opening.""</p>
              <p>Tom of Finland's work, often depicting explicit gay sex, has
not been without controversy over the years, notably over his
use of Nazi imagery and aesthetics.</p>
              <p>But Cross Lane Projects, which curated the exhibition with
the foundation as part of the Lakes International Comic Art
Festival, said they had received just one complaint since the
late September opening.</p>
              <p>Indeed, Tom's work is highly sought after, gracing the walls
of New York's Museum of Modern Art and the Museum of
Contemporary Art in the Finnish capital, Helsinki.</p>
              <p>Now Dehner supports up-and-coming LGBT+ artists through the
foundation, offering assistance and even accommodation at Tom's
House in Los Angeles, where the artist lived and worked
alongside Dehner.</p>
              <p>As a new generation seeks out his work, Dehner said Tom's
legacy as an artist is assured.</p>
              <p>""He said it himself: 'My aim is not to create an ideal, but
to draw beautiful men who love each other and are proud of it,'""
Dehner said.</p>

I conic gay artist Tom of Finland was an early fighter for LGBT+
rights, preparing a generation of gay men in the 1940s and '50s
to become activists who would fight for equality a decade later,
the founder of the illustrator's foundation said on Thursday.
Tom's images of burly, leather-clad moustachioed muscle men
marked a ""radical shift"" from the then-prevailing idea of gay
men as limp-wristed fops hiding in the shadows, said Durk
Dehner, who set up the Tom of Finland Foundation with the artist
in 1984.
""He was the forerunner of getting us prepared to be gay
liberationists,"" Dehner told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on
Thursday of the artist whose real name was Touko Laaksonen.
""No matter what the sexual orientation of the people who
view his work, what they come away with is a sense of feeling
good about life and feeling good about being humans being sexual
in their nature,"" he added.
Born in southwestern Finland in 1920, Tom was widely
7embraced by LGBT+ culture in the 1970s and 80s, although some
critics dismissed him as a mere cartoonist or illustrator.
Photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, also known for the
graphically homoerotic nature of his work, was an early
supporter. Having met Tom in San Francisco, he helped stage an
exhibition of his works in 1980.
While Dehner said Mapplethorpe was known for being
difficult, he played a critical role in persuading fellow fine
artists to accept Tom as one of their own.
""(Mapplethorpe) was one of the first to move Tom over to
contemporary art facilities,"" Dehner said. ""Prior to that we had
been using gay or alternative galleries.""
Speaking at an exhibit of Tom's work at Cross Lane Projects
in the northern English town of Kendal, Dehner, dressed in
leather  - jeans, jacket and tie - was visibly moved as he
looked back on his years as Tom's friend, lover and muse.
""He's been gone now for 30 years,"" he reflected. ""But he's
in my life everyday.""
Dehner, who said he turned down an offer from screen idol
Rock Hudson to be his boyfriend, spent his childhood in Alberta,
Canada before following the hippie dream and moving to
California in 1977.
With a wry laugh, he noted ""And I'm stuck in LA - which was
the super-capital of plastic!""
But he said life in Laurel Canyon brought benefits. ""I got
to listen to James Taylor and Carole King compose music every
morning when they lived one street up from us.""

SPIRITUAL MATTERS
The language of transcendental meditation still informs much
of Dehner's speech, with talk moving from sex and the leather
aesthetic to more spiritual matters and personal beliefs.
Dehner, who worked as a male model, was photographed by star
photographer Bruce Weber and won access to ""the sort of elite
gays"" in 1970s and '80s New York.
""The first exhibition I arranged for Tom was in the Village
in New York in 1979. It was at a place called Stompers which was
an alternative gallery, and both Robert (Mapplethorpe) and Andy
(Warhol) came to that opening.""
Tom of Finland's work, often depicting explicit gay sex, has
not been without controversy over the years, notably over his
use of Nazi imagery and aesthetics.
But Cross Lane Projects, which curated the exhibition with
the foundation as part of the Lakes International Comic Art
Festival, said they had received just one complaint since the
late September opening.
Indeed, Tom's work is highly sought after, gracing the walls
of New York's Museum of Modern Art and the Museum of
Contemporary Art in the Finnish capital, Helsinki.
Now Dehner supports up-and-coming LGBT+ artists through the
foundation, offering assistance and even accommodation at Tom's
House in Los Angeles, where the artist lived and worked
alongside Dehner.
As a new generation seeks out his work, Dehner said Tom's
legacy as an artist is assured.
""He said it himself: 'My aim is not to create an ideal, but
to draw beautiful men who love each other and are proud of it,'""
Dehner said.

women in stadiums for Thursday's World Cup qualifier did not go
far enough, with many female fans unable to buy tickets even
though seats were available.</p>
              <p>Maryam Shojaei, who made international headlines when she
protested against the ban at last year's World Cup in Russia,

the match against Cambodia which Iran won 14-0.</p>

stadium, lifting a ban in place for over 40 years.</p>
              <p>""It's a good thing, but part of me is very angry, especially
about the bars between the women and men,"" she told the Thomson

              <p>Shojaei said only 3,500 tickets were allocated for women

              <p>""This is a direct example of gender discrimination when

'HATED BAN'
FIFA stepped up pressure on Iran following the death of
football fan Sahar Khodayari last month, who set herself on fire
in protest at her arrest for trying to get into a match.
Video footage posted on Twitter showed some supporters
chanting ""Blue Girl, Blue Girl"" - a reference to the colours of

""I think they think that if they give in on this they will

never just about sport.
""The only logic for keeping this hated ban in place for so

basic rights - and they absolutely should,"" she added.
HRW said women photographers had been banned from covering
Thursday's match and that it had lodged a complaint with FIFA.
""Iran is still not playing by the rules,"" Worden said. ""The
ban is crumbling, but it's not gone.""
No one at FIFA was immediately available for comment.
Shojaei's campaign attracted international attention last
year when she raised a banner during Iran's World Cup matches
with the slogan: ""Support Iranian women to attend stadiums

On Thursday she said her brother Masoud supported lifting

""We are very proud of him, but we are not proud of this

electric buses to pollution-sucking urban gardens, cities around

              <p/>
              <p>1. MEDELLIN, Colombia - Colombia's second city has invested
more
than $16 million to plant almost 9,000 trees to form 30 ""green
corridors"" across the city since 2016. Besides capturing
pollution, the plants have helped reduce average temperatures in
the city by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) and increased
biodiversity, providing friendly habitats for animals.</p>
              <p>2. ACCRA, Ghana - Since 2016, Accra has been working with
more than
600 informal refuse collectors, who used to dump rubbish that
was burned at illegal open-air sites, causing pollution. More
waste is now being collected, recycled and disposed of safely.</p>
              <p>3. KOLKATA, India - Kolkata is planning to have its entire
5,000-strong bus fleet, as well as ferries crossing the Ganges
River, run on electricity by 2030. It has bought 80 electric
buses and plans to add another 100 next year.</p>
              <p>4. LONDON, United Kingdom - London introduced the world's
first
Ultra Low Emission Zone in 2019, requiring all vehicles passing
through the city centre to meet strict emissions standards or
pay a fee. Within months, the number of more polluting vehicles
fell by a third as people were pushed to walk, cycle or use
public transport.</p>
              <p>5. SAN FRANCISCO, United States - San Francisco's
CleanPowerSF
programme allows residents to get their electricity completely
or in large part from renewable sources at competitive rates.
The city hopes this will help it achieve a goal of reducing
greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2025.</p>
              <p>6. GUANGZHOU, China - Since 2017, Guangzhou has invested
$2.1
billion to convert its entire fleet of 11,220 buses to run on
electricity and installed some 4,000 charging stations to power
them. This has reduced air pollution and noise as well as the
city's transport system operational costs.</p>
              <p>7. SEOUL, South Korea - Seoul has subsidised the
installation of
solar panels on balconies and rooftops of 1 million homes since
2017, as well as city buildings like schools and parking lots.
The city hopes to produce up to 1 GW of solar energy - equal to
that generated by a nuclear reactor - by 2022.</p>

              <p>MEXICO CITY, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When an
Avengers comic featuring a gay kiss was banned from Brazil's
largest book festival, author Nana Queiroz stuffed copies of her
latest bestseller into a suitcase in a bid to outwit
authorities' latest move to silence LGBT+ storytellers.</p>
              <p>""I decided that if they didn't allow us to sell the books at
the fair, I would go on the streets and do it there,"" said
Queiroz, who was promoting ""Eu, Travesti"" or ""I, Transvestite""
co-written with transvestite activist Luisa Marilac.</p>
              <p>In the end, Brazil's highest court ruled that banning books
over LGBT+ content was illegal and Queiroz was able to sell her
book without it being confiscated by officials from the mayor's
office in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
              <p>But the incident has given impetus to artists, politicians
and lawyers to push back against efforts to stop LGBT+ stories
being told, which have intensified since self-proclaimed ""proud""
homophobe, President Jair Bolsonaro came to power in January.</p>
              <p>""This type of state intervention into culture has been
normalised, which is very worrying,"" said Renan Quinalha, a law

              <p>Although same-sex marriage has been legal in Brazil since
2013, it is a deeply religious country where homophobia is
common and both the Catholic Church and the popular evangelical
Christian movement frequently criticise gay rights.</p>
              <p>It is also one of the most dangerous countries in the world
for LGBT+ people, with 320 gay and trans people murdered last
year, according to watchdog group Grupo Gay da Bahia.</p>
              <p>Upon assuming office, ex-army officer Bolsonaro removed

              <p>LONDON, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Global
prosecution and conviction levels for human trafficking are
""abysmal"", a senior European security official said on Thursday,
urging states to invest more in combatting a crime that affects
millions of people.</p>
              <p>Governments are not devoting enough resources to tackling
the crime, Valiant Richey said in his first interview since
taking charge of anti-trafficking at the Organization for
Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), a security watchdog.</p>
              <p>""No country is winning on human trafficking right now,"" he
told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p>""What we're seeing is a fairly abysmal level of prosecution
and convictions across the OSCE.""</p>
              <p>Almost 25 million people around the world could be trapped
in forced labour, the International Labor Organization (ILO)
estimates, from construction and agricultural workers to sex
trafficking victims.</p>
              <p>That compares to between 4,000 and 5,000 human trafficking
convictions a year across the OSCE, which has 57 member states
in North America, Europe and Asia with a combined population of
more than 1 billion people, Richey said.</p>
              <p>The global movement to stop trafficking and modern-day
slavery was boosted by United Nations agreements that came into
force in 2003 known as the Palermo Protocols.</p>
              <p>Since then, most countries have passed an anti-human
trafficking law, trained some authorities and provide some
services, Richey said.</p>
              <p>""It's a great example of international law helping to spur a
response, the problem is that it's not working, we haven't
solved the problem.""</p>
              <p>Richey, a former U.S. prosecutor, was this month appointed
Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating
Trafficking in Human Beings at the OSCE, running a team of 15
people.</p>
              <p>He said he would focus next year on drawing attention to
levels of investment in prosecuting human trafficking, which he
said were vastly outstripped by money devoted to efforts to stop
drug trafficking.</p>
              <p>Governments around the world carried out 11,096 trafficking
prosecutions in 2018 and won 7,481 convictions, according to
estimates compiled in the Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report by
the U.S. State Department.</p>
              <p>Prosecutions have risen since 2012, but hit a peak of 19,127
in 2015, the data shows. Governments identified 85,613
trafficking victims in 2018, up more than 80 percent from 2012,
the report said.</p>
              <p>Some civil society groups working to combat human
trafficking have raised concerns about heavy-handed law
enforcement causing harm, particularly for migrants who are
deported, or sex workers imprisoned.</p>
              <p>In recent years, Britain has sent home or aided the return
of dozens of trafficking victims to hotspots including Albania,
Nigeria and Vietnam despite the risk they could be targeted
again.</p>
              <p>Richey said his team had worked on guidelines to help
authorities identify migrant victims of trafficking and get them
assistance regardless of whether they cooperated with police
investigations.</p>
              <p>He said he did not think the answer was to stop prosecuting
people.</p>
              <p>""We can't take that position,"" he said. ""The level of
impunity is really grossly outweighing the implementation of
these laws right now.""

              <p>NAIROBI, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda
announced plans on Thursday for a bill that would impose the
death penalty on homosexuals, saying the legislation would curb
a rise in unnatural sex in the east African nation.</p>
              <p>The bill - colloquially known as ""Kill the Gays"" in Uganda -
was nullified five years ago on a technicality and the
government said it plans to resurrect it within weeks.</p>
              <p>""Homosexuality is not natural to Ugandans, but there has
been a massive recruitment by gay people in schools, and
especially among the youth, where they are promoting the
falsehood that people are born like that,"" Ethics and Integrity
Minister Simon Lokodo told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p>""Our current penal law is limited. It only criminalises the
act. We want it made clear that anyone who is even involved in
promotion and recruitment has to be criminalised. Those that do
grave acts will be given the death sentence.""</p>

By Nita Bhalla
NAIROBI, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda
announced plans on Thursday for a bill that would impose the
death penalty on homosexuals, saying the legislation would curb
a rise in unnatural sex in the east African nation.
The bill - colloquially known as ""Kill the Gays"" in Uganda -
was nullified five years ago on a technicality and the
government said it plans to resurrect it within weeks.
""Homosexuality is not natural to Ugandans, but there has
been a massive recruitment by gay people in schools, and
especially among the youth, where they are promoting the
falsehood that people are born like that,"" Ethics and Integrity
Minister Simon Lokodo told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
""Our current penal law is limited. It only criminalises the
act. We want it made clear that anyone who is even involved in
promotion and recruitment has to be criminalised. Those that do
grave acts will be given the death sentence.""
African countries have some of the world's most prohibitive
laws governing homosexuality. Same-sex relationships are
considered taboo and gay sex is a crime across most of the
continent, with punishments ranging from imprisonment to death.
Earlier this year, Brunei sparked international outcry over
plans to impose the death penalty for gay sex, backtracking only
after intense criticism.
Now Uganda wants to follow suit.
Lokodo said the bill, which is supported by President Yoweri
Museveni, will be re-introduced in parliament in the coming
weeks and is expected to be voted on before the end of the year.
He was optimistic it would pass with the necessary
two-thirds of members present - a shortfall in numbers killed a
similar bill in 2014 - as the government had lobbied legislators
ahead of its re-introduction, Lokodo added.
""We have been talking to the MPs and we have mobilised them
in big numbers,"" said Lokodo. ""Many are supportive.""
Uganda's constitutional court overturned the law - formerly
known as the ""Kill the Gays"" bill because it includes the death
penalty - on a technicality in 2014.
Even without it, Uganda is one of the hardest countries in
Africa to be a sexual minority. Under British colonial law, gay
sex is punishable with up to life imprisonment and activists
said the new bill risked unleashing attacks.
""Bringing back anti-gay legislation would invariably lead to
a spike in discrimination and atrocities,"" said Zahra Mohamed of
the Toronto-based charity Stephen Lewis Foundation.

FEARFUL
Moves to restrict LGBT+ rights and criminalise gay sex in
other countries have sparked protests and sanctions.
In May, Brunei was forced to extend a moratorium on the
death penalty for gay sex after celebrities such as actor George
Clooney condemned a law allowing whipping and stoning to death.
Last November, anti-gay remarks by a senior official in
Tanzania led to the east African nation's second biggest donor,
Denmark, withholding $10 million in aid.
Uganda faced widespread international condemnation when the
previous bill was signed off by Museveni in 2014.
The United States reduced aid, imposed visa restrictions and
cancelled military exercises. The World Bank, Sweden, Norway,
Denmark and the Netherlands also suspended or redirected aid.
Lokodo said Uganda was prepared for any negative response.
""It is a concern,"" he said.
""But we are ready. We don't like blackmailing. Much as we
know that this is going to irritate our supporters in budget and
governance, we can't just bend our heads and bow before people
who want to impose a culture which is foreign to us.""
Pepe Julian Onziema from Sexual Minorities Uganda, an
alliance of LGBT+ organisations, said its members were fearful.
""When the law was introduced last time, it whipped up
homophobic sentiment and hate crimes,"" said Onziema.
""Hundreds of LGBT+ people have been forced to leave the

Onziema said three gay men and one transgender woman had

              <p>But a similar law introduced in neighbouring Singapore - the

              <p>Luis Rodriguez, 20, fled El Salvador with his father and the
man he had been in a secret relationship with since high school.
The couple had been assaulted on a dark, remote beach where they
were accustomed to meeting. The attack is documented in a police
report that recommended the men “emigrate.”  After being
detained for a few months in California, he was chosen by fellow
migrant detainees to write a letter of protest about forced
labor and other poor conditions there. Following his detention
and exhausting journey, he has recovered and is on track to get
his GED.</p>

              <p>Reuters’journalists, who followed the 2018-19 migrant
caravans on the ground from their inception, continued to keep
track of migrants to see where, and how, they ended up. Facing
an increasingly complex and shifting constellation of U.S.
policies aimed at reducing immigration, many landed in uncertain
territory. Many remain there. Reuters chose to profile six
migrants from three Central American countries, based largely on
their varying backgrounds – male and female, young and older,
gay and straight. Reporters, photographers and videographers
followed them though detentions, deportations, family
separations and course changes, as well as hopeful, if fragile,
beginnings in the United States.</p>

him up in an apartment in Mexico City, where he is slowly
recovering from the terror he felt in Honduras, where he said
gang members stalked him and shot him in the leg. Despite dreams
of eventually settling in the United States, he’s happy in
Mexico and staying put for now.</p>

Yoro, Honduras, after being separated from his 12-year-old son
at the U.S. border under the administration’s “zero-tolerance”

border official of having an open criminal case against him in
his homeland. He struggled to prove that his record was clear –
and ultimately received confirmation from the Honduran
government in a watermarked document – but it was too late. He
was deported and can’t enter the U.S. for five years.</p>

clinging to box cars. They were separated at the U.S. border -
she was detained in California and Anderson flown 2,000 miles
away to a New York children’s center. He was there for 10
months, where case management documents say he was medicated for
ADHD and molested by another child. At times, he became
aggressive with others too. His release was delayed by a
nationwide backlog of kids in detention. After he was finally
freed to live with his mother in Eugene, his grandmother was
deported.</p>

The migrant caravans: A common road toward different fates
Reuters’journalists, who followed the 2018-19 migrant
caravans on the ground from their inception, continued to keep
track of migrants to see where, and how, they ended up. Facing
an increasingly complex and shifting constellation of U.S.
policies aimed at reducing immigration, many landed in uncertain
territory. Many remain there. Reuters chose to profile six
migrants from three Central American countries, based largely on
their varying backgrounds – male and female, young and older,
gay and straight. Reporters, photographers and videographers
followed them though detentions, deportations, family
separations and course changes, as well as hopeful, if fragile,
beginnings in the United States.

Jose Caceres, 31, is back working in the arid fields of
Yoro, Honduras, after being separated from his 12-year-old son
at the U.S. border under the administration’s “zero-tolerance”
policy. As his son was led away crying, Jose was accused by a
border official of having an open criminal case against him in
his homeland. He struggled to prove that his record was clear –
and ultimately received confirmation from the Honduran
government in a watermarked document – but it was too late. He
was deported and can’t enter the U.S. for five years.

months, where case management documents say he was medicated for

              <p>ADDIS ABABA, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Every
day, Tewdros Belay turns on the tap in his home in the heart of
Ethiopia's capital and expects nothing to happen. The rare times
when water does trickle from the spout, it is reason to
celebrate.</p>
              <p>""Sometimes we do not get water for so many weeks - if we get
water, we welcome it by dancing,"" said Tewdros, 32, with a sad
smile.</p>
              <p>Like many of his neighbours in the Kirkos district of Addis
Ababa, and like thousands of others living in the city, Tewdros
has struggled to secure a regular supply of clean water in his
home for at least 10 years.</p>
              <p>Ethiopia is the source of up to 80% of the River Nile's
water. But getting enough potable water to everyone in the
country who needs it is a challenge, water experts and officials
say.</p>
              <p>The capital has long suffered with water shortages, the
result of an aging and limited water supply system, lack of
water storage and a rapidly growing population.</p>
              <p>Environmental experts warn that climate change will only
make matters worse in the future.</p>
              <p>Hoping to ease the shortage, the Addis Ababa government has
embarked on a series of development projects aimed at pumping
storing, cleaning and delivering more groundwater.</p>
              <p>The latest, the Legedadi Phase II Water Project, launched in
April, aims to supply the city with an additional 86,000 cubic
metres of clean water per day.</p>
              <p>That would help boost the area of the city receiving regular
water supply from 60% to 66%, according to Nigusse Desalegn,
spokesman for the Addis Ababa Water and Sewerage Authority
(AAWSA).</p>
              <p>The government also plans to install additional groundwater
infrastructure that would supply the city with another 130,000
cubic metres of clean water a day, Nigusse said.</p>
              <p>""We believe (these projects) will play a significant role in
solving the growing water scarcity problem,"" he said.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>GROWING DEMAND</p>
              <p>Currently, the dams, reservoirs and wells that constitute
the Addis Ababa water supply system provide less than two-thirds
of the 930,000 cubic metres of potable water residents need
every day, according to the AAWSA.</p>
              <p>Nigusse pointed to Ethiopia's steady economic growth, and
its rising population, as factors in Addis Ababa's clean water
shortage.</p>
              <p>The city's water demands have almost doubled in the past
five years, he said, and that demand is rising every day as the
capital expands both out and up, with a boom in the construction
of apartment blocks and offices, Nigusse said.</p>
              <p>Bisrat Kifle, a researcher and associate professor at
Ethiopian Civil Service University, said the problem will get
worse as extreme weather events such as flooding and drought
become more common.</p>
              <p>Research by Bisrat and his colleagues published in 2017
estimated that by 2039 Addis Ababa's current population of more
than 3.5 million will reach 7 million.</p>
              <p>As that happens, water scarcity could heighten ""as a result
of complex interaction of urbanisation and climate change"", it
noted.</p>
              <p>The capital already experiences bouts of heavy rainfall and
""we project rainfall will increase and the effect will be
siltation (of reservoirs) due to flooding,"" Bisrat said.</p>
              <p>When soil washes into reservoirs, it leaves less room for
storing water. As a result, he said, Addis Ababa and some of its
suburbs could be facing an additional clean water shortfall of
up to 380 million cubic meters per year.</p>
              <p>The health consequences of lack of water can be dire, health
experts say.</p>
              <p>Among Ethiopia's population of more than 100 million, about
42 million people do not have access to safe drinking water,
according to the Barcelona-based We Are Water Foundation.</p>
              <p>Each year, 8,500 children under the age of five die due to
diseases caused by contaminated water, according to the
foundation.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>CHALLENGES</p>
              <p>The state-funded Legedadi Stage II Water Project, estimated
to cost up to 4 billion birr ($137 million), according to
government figures, is due to be completed by 2021.</p>
              <p>It will include 15 new reservoirs to store pumped
groundwater and 176 kilometres (109 miles) of pipelines to
deliver it, according to AAWSA data.</p>
              <p>For now, a share of Addis Ababa residents say they have to
resort to buying water for everything from drinking to cooking
to washing.</p>
              <p>Tewdros in Kirkos said people routinely queued for up to 10
hours to get water from roadside vendors and water tank trucks.</p>
              <p>""We carry jerry cans and travel far away and buy 10 litres
of water for 2 birr ($0.068) which will even be used just for
hygiene,"" he said, adding that he hoped the government would
come through with a solution.</p>
              <p>Nigusse told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the
government's efforts to get potable water to everyone in the
city are hampered in part by a system of leaky pipes and by the
city's sometimes erratic energy supply.</p>
              <p>A study by the Addis Ababa Institute of Technology published
in 2012 showed that more than a third of the water running
through the capital's pipes leaked out before getting to
residents.</p>
              <p>Unseasonable dry spells, linked to climate change, also are
having an impact on the water supply, Nigusse added.</p>
              <p>Almost all of the electricity distributed through the
country's power grid comes from hydropower, according to the
World Bank.</p>
              <p>When the country gets less rainfall than expected and dam
levels drop, so does the power supply - which, in turn, makes it
difficult for the government to get enough clean water to
everyone, including those in the capital.</p>
              <p>""There are recurrent power shortages, so it is difficult to
pump water from the ground"" into the reservoirs, Nigusse said.</p>
              <p>For Bisrat, the answer lies not in building more reservoirs,
but in making more efficient water use and water conservation a
priority for households and businesses.</p>
              <p>He recommended the government introduce a seasonal tariff -
charging people more for water during drought - and impose
financial penalties when consumption exceeds a reasonable
amount.</p>
              <p>""We have to know how to use our resources as a metropolitan
city and think about climate change and water scarcity in every
decision,"" Bisrat said.

every day, according to the AAWSA.
Nigusse pointed to Ethiopia's steady economic growth, and
its rising population, as factors in Addis Ababa's clean water
shortage.
The city's water demands have almost doubled in the past
five years, he said, and that demand is rising every day as the
capital expands both out and up, with a boom in the construction
of apartment blocks and offices, Nigusse said.
Bisrat Kifle, a researcher and associate professor at
Ethiopian Civil Service University, said the problem will get
worse as extreme weather events such as flooding and drought
become more common.
Research by Bisrat and his colleagues published in 2017
estimated that by 2039 Addis Ababa's current population of more
than 3.5 million will reach 7 million.
As that happens, water scarcity could heighten ""as a result
of complex interaction of urbanisation and climate change"", it
noted.
The capital already experiences bouts of heavy rainfall and
""we project rainfall will increase and the effect will be
siltation (of reservoirs) due to flooding,"" Bisrat said.
When soil washes into reservoirs, it leaves less room for
storing water. As a result, he said, Addis Ababa and some of its
suburbs could be facing an additional clean water shortfall of
up to 380 million cubic meters per year.
The health consequences of lack of water can be dire, health
experts say.
Among Ethiopia's population of more than 100 million, about
42 million people do not have access to safe drinking water,
according to the Barcelona-based We Are Water Foundation.
Each year, 8,500 children under the age of five die due to
diseases caused by contaminated water, according to the
foundation.

CHALLENGES
The state-funded Legedadi Stage II Water Project, estimated
to cost up to 4 billion birr ($137 million), according to
government figures, is due to be completed by 2021.
It will include 15 new reservoirs to store pumped
groundwater and 176 kilometres (109 miles) of pipelines to
deliver it, according to AAWSA data.
For now, a share of Addis Ababa residents say they have to
resort to buying water for everything from drinking to cooking
to washing.
Tewdros in Kirkos said people routinely queued for up to 10
hours to get water from roadside vendors and water tank trucks.
""We carry jerry cans and travel far away and buy 10 litres
of water for 2 birr ($0.068) which will even be used just for
hygiene,"" he said, adding that he hoped the government would
come through with a solution.
Nigusse told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the
government's efforts to get potable water to everyone in the
city are hampered in part by a system of leaky pipes and by the
city's sometimes erratic energy supply.
A study by the Addis Ababa Institute of Technology published
in 2012 showed that more than a third of the water running
through the capital's pipes leaked out before getting to
residents.
Unseasonable dry spells, linked to climate change, also are
having an impact on the water supply, Nigusse added.
Almost all of the electricity distributed through the
country's power grid comes from hydropower, according to the
World Bank.
When the country gets less rainfall than expected and dam
levels drop, so does the power supply - which, in turn, makes it
difficult for the government to get enough clean water to
everyone, including those in the capital.
""There are recurrent power shortages, so it is difficult to
pump water from the ground"" into the reservoirs, Nigusse said.
For Bisrat, the answer lies not in building more reservoirs,
but in making more efficient water use and water conservation a
priority for households and businesses.
He recommended the government introduce a seasonal tariff -
charging people more for water during drought - and impose
financial penalties when consumption exceeds a reasonable
amount.
""We have to know how to use our resources as a metropolitan
city and think about climate change and water scarcity in every
decision,"" Bisrat said.

              <p>LONDON, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Greta Thunberg
is the bookmakers' firm favourite to win the 2019 Nobel Peace
Prize on Friday and become the youngest ever laureate, but some
experts believe her youth could count against her.</p>
              <p>If she wins the 16-year-old climate activist, who went from
anonymity in her native Sweden to leader of a global movement in
little more than a year, will join the likes of Nelson Mandela,
Jimmy Carter and Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>
              <p>Henrik Urdal, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo,
was among those who expressed doubts, saying the prize committee
would have to consider the impact the honour would have on such
a young person and could award it jointly.</p>
              <p>""She is relatively young and the committee, if they are
considering her candidacy, might want to share the attention and
the burden,"" he said.</p>
              <p>Here are some key events in Thunberg's rise.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>August 20, 2018: Swedish student Thunberg, then aged 15,
skips school to protest outside parliament for more action
against climate change.</p>
              <p>August 26, 2018: She is joined by fellow students, teachers
and parents at another protest and begins attracting media
attention for her climate campaign.</p>
              <p>September 2018: Thunberg begins a regular 'strike' from
classes every Friday to protest climate issues. She invites
other students to join her weekly ""Fridays for Future"" campaign
by staging walkouts at their own schools.</p>
              <p>November 2018: More than 17,000 students in 24 countries
take part in Friday school strikes. Thunberg begins speaking at
high-profile events across Europe, including U.N. climate talks
in Poland.</p>
              <p>February 2019: Protests directly inspired by Thunberg take
place across more than 30 countries, from Sweden to Brazil,
India and the United States.</p>
              <p>March 2019: Thunberg is nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.
The number of students taking part in school strikes hits more
than 2 million people across 135 countries.</p>
              <p>May 2019: Thunberg is named one of the world's most
influential people by Time magazine, appearing on its cover.
""Now I am speaking to the whole world,"" she wrote on Twitter.</p>
              <p>July 2019: Conservative and far-right lawmakers urge a
boycott of Thunberg's appearance in the French parliament,
mocking her as a ""guru of the apocalypse"" and a ""Nobel prize of
fear"".</p>
              <p>August 1, 2019: Thunberg hits back at ""hate and conspiracy
campaigns"" after by conservative Australian commentator Andrew
Bolt described her as a ""deeply disturbed messiah"".</p>
              <p>August 5, 2019: Some 450 young climate activists from 37
European countries gather in Switzerland to discuss the
movement's development.</p>
              <p>August 14, 2019: Thunberg sets sail from Britain for the
United States to take part in a U.N. climate summit. Meanwhile,

LONDON, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Greta Thunberg
is the bookmakers' firm favourite to win the 2019 Nobel Peace
Prize on Friday and become the youngest ever laureate, but some
experts believe her youth could count against her.
If she wins the 16-year-old climate activist, who went from
anonymity in her native Sweden to leader of a global movement in
little more than a year, will join the likes of Nelson Mandela,
Jimmy Carter and Mikhail Gorbachev.
Henrik Urdal, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo,
was among those who expressed doubts, saying the prize committee
would have to consider the impact the honour would have on such
a young person and could award it jointly.
""She is relatively young and the committee, if they are
considering her candidacy, might want to share the attention and
the burden,"" he said.
Here are some key events in Thunberg's rise.

August 20, 2018: Swedish student Thunberg, then aged 15,
skips school to protest outside parliament for more action
against climate change.
August 26, 2018: She is joined by fellow students, teachers
and parents at another protest and begins attracting media
attention for her climate campaign.
September 2018: Thunberg begins a regular 'strike' from
classes every Friday to protest climate issues. She invites
other students to join her weekly ""Fridays for Future"" campaign
by staging walkouts at their own schools.
November 2018: More than 17,000 students in 24 countries
take part in Friday school strikes. Thunberg begins speaking at
high-profile events across Europe, including U.N. climate talks
in Poland.
February 2019: Protests directly inspired by Thunberg take
place across more than 30 countries, from Sweden to Brazil,
India and the United States.
March 2019: Thunberg is nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.
The number of students taking part in school strikes hits more
than 2 million people across 135 countries.
May 2019: Thunberg is named one of the world's most
influential people by Time magazine, appearing on its cover.
""Now I am speaking to the whole world,"" she wrote on Twitter.
July 2019: Conservative and far-right lawmakers urge a
boycott of Thunberg's appearance in the French parliament,
mocking her as a ""guru of the apocalypse"" and a ""Nobel prize of
fear"".
August 1, 2019: Thunberg hits back at ""hate and conspiracy
campaigns"" after by conservative Australian commentator Andrew
Bolt described her as a ""deeply disturbed messiah"".
August 5, 2019: Some 450 young climate activists from 37
European countries gather in Switzerland to discuss the
movement's development.
August 14, 2019: Thunberg sets sail from Britain for the
United States to take part in a U.N. climate summit. Meanwhile,
the total number of climate strikers reaches 3.6 million people
across 169 countries.
August 28, 2019: Thunberg arrives at New York Harbor in a
zero-carbon emissions vessel, completing a nearly 14-day journey
from England to take part in a U.N. climate summit.
September 13, 2019: Thunberg takes her mission to U.S.
President Donald Trump's doorstep with a protest outside the
White House.
September 18, 2019: Thunberg is one of four students invited
to a U.S. congressional hearing to provide the next generation's
views on climate change.
September 23, 2019: Thunberg delivers a blistering speech to
leaders at the U.N. summit, accusing them of having ""stolen my
dreams and my childhood with your empty words"".
September 24, 2019: The teenager hits back at mockery from
the U.S. President Donald Trump, changing her Twitter biography
to quote his comments.

of the 2019 Right Livelihood Award, known as Sweden's
alternative Nobel Prize.

              <p>MUMBAI, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Just hours
after the high court dismissed petitions against cutting trees
in a heavily wooded area in suburban Mumbai for a metro rail
depot, hundreds of protesters swarmed the site, crying and
clinging to trees as the felling began.</p>
              <p>It was an unusual display of emotion for normally stoic
Mumbaikars, who braved arrests on Friday night to try and stop
the cutting of nearly 3,000 trees in Aarey Colony, known as the
Indian city's ""green lung"".</p>
              <p>On Monday, the Supreme Court, after hearing a petition,
stayed the cutting of more trees until Oct. 21.</p>
              <p>As rising heat and frequent floods batter some of the
world's most densely populated and polluted cities in India,
urban residents are rallying around fast disappearing green
spaces seen as vital safeguards.</p>
              <p>In the southern city of Bengaluru, residents protested the
cutting of hundreds of trees for a flyover, while a petition led
the Supreme Court to slam the amendment of a colonial-era law to
open up the Aravalli mountains for real estate development.</p>
              <p>""Earlier, villages bore the brunt of climate-change impacts,
but now cities are also experiencing flooding, air pollution and
water scarcity more often,"" said Kanchi Kohli, a researcher at
the Centre for Policy Research think tank in Delhi.</p>
              <p>""People have realised that disappearing green spaces are a
part of the problem, and there is a strong determination to
fight on the streets and in the courts because they see no other
way to make themselves heard,"" she said.</p>
              <p>With almost 70% of the world's population estimated to be
living in cities by 2050, mainly in Africa and Asia, cities will
bear the brunt of warming temperatures, climate experts warn.</p>
              <p>Asia's booming cities are losing green spaces as a
construction boom gobbles up land for offices and apartments,
worsening the heat island effect and causing flooding that has
killed hundreds from Mumbai to Manila, according to
environmentalists.</p>
              <p>""We're not saying, don't cut a single tree; we're only
saying don't needlessly cut trees because there simply aren't
enough trees,"" said Zoru Bathena, an activist who has filed
several petitions against tree felling in Mumbai.</p>
              <p>""Why should development always be at the cost of the
environment?""</p>
              <p/>
              <p>NET LOSS</p>
              <p>A fifth of the world's major cities will face ""unknown""
climate conditions by 2050, as rising temperatures heighten the
risks of drought and flooding, scientists at the Crowther Lab in
Switzerland have warned.</p>
              <p>Cities in tropical regions such as South Asia are likely to
see some of the strongest impacts, the study showed.</p>
              <p>Nearly 300 people died in floods in 2015 in the coastal city
of Chennai, where floodplains have long been built over.</p>
              <p>Mumbai's tree cover has fallen to less than 13% from more
than 35% in the 1970s, according to the Indian Institute of
Science, which recommends green cover of a third of total area.</p>
              <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to restore
26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030 through tree
planting and other means, alongside a push to switch to electric
vehicles by 2030 to cut carbon emissions.</p>
              <p>But the loss of green spaces in urban areas cannot be offset
by planting trees elsewhere, said Chetan Agarwal, an analyst at
the Centre for Ecology, Development and Research.</p>
              <p>""The loss of green spaces in cities represents a net
ecological loss, as large numbers of people are concentrated
there and are deprived of their benefits,"" he said.</p>
              <p>""Small and large green spaces provide a toehold for nature
in the city, with manifold benefits including better air quality
and overall health,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p>From Athens to Seoul, big cities worldwide are planting more
trees to minimise the severity of heatwaves and floods, and to
boost people's physical and mental health.</p>
              <p>The United Nations recently unveiled plans to create urban
forests in cities in Africa and Asia to improve air quality, cut
the risk of floods and heatwaves, and halt land degradation.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>DUST STORMS</p>
              <p>Nearly 30% of India's land area has been degraded through
deforestation, over-cultivation and depletion of wetlands,
according to the government.</p>
              <p>This is evident in the Aravalli mountains, which run through
four states for a distance of nearly 700km (435 miles).</p>
              <p>Dilution of environmental laws over the years have led to
deforestation, construction and illegal mining, causing
desertification, drying up of lakes, and more frequent dust
storms.</p>
              <p>The Delhi Ridge, a stretch of the Aravallis, acts as lungs
for the city's toxic smog, and is a cherished green space.</p>
              <p>In February, Haryana state amended the Punjab Land
Preservation Act of 1900 to open up thousands of acres of forest
land in the Aravallis for construction and mining, sparking
protests in Delhi and in neighbouring Gurugram.</p>
              <p>Days later, the Supreme Court, responding to a petition by
environmentalists, said it was ""shocking"" that the Haryana
government was destroying the forest, and that the new law
cannot be enforced without the court's permission.</p>
              <p>""The loss of the Aravallis will impact water security,
fragment wildlife habitat and corridors, and reduce the capacity
to mitigate air pollution in Delhi and elsewhere,"" said Agarwal.</p>
              <p>But as urban populations expand rapidly, land is needed for
housing and transport, authorities say, putting pressure on
green spaces including cemeteries.</p>
              <p>""We do not wish to cut even a single tree in Aarey, but
development is also important. We will plant more trees in place
of those cut,"" said Devendra Fadnavis, chief minister of
Maharashtra state where Mumbai is located.</p>
              <p>The densely wooded area, spread over 16 sq km (6 sq miles),
is home to 27 tribal villages and various animal species,
including leopards.</p>
              <p>Over the past few decades, swathes of land have been
allocated for slum resettlement, a defence training unit and a
zoo. The site for the metro shed is a 33-hectare plot.</p>
              <p>""We're not against the metro; we all want better public
transport. But this is just a shed - it can be built elsewhere
without cutting so many trees,"" said Bathena.</p>
              <p>Commitments to increasing forest cover and cutting carbon
emissions are not enough, said Kohli.</p>
              <p>""Building a flyover, or a metro shed by cutting down trees
can get us more convenience, but at what cost?""</p>

ROME, Oct 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - With about 9
billion birds slaughtered every year, the United States eats
more chicken than any other country, and its growing consumption
of the meat is harming the environment.
Now former chef Matthew Wadiak is hoping to make raising
chickens more environmentally friendly, with a new breed of
""carbon-friendly"" birds that live off food grown locally and
sustainably.
Chicken is seen as a more environmentally responsible choice
than other meats because it accounts for just 8% of the
planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions from the livestock
sector.
But Wadiak believes it could be much greener. Nearly 80% of
the emissions from farming chickens come from growing their
feed, made from soybeans and other crops associated with
deforestation, something he wants to change.
""There's been a lot of studies to show that we can, in
theory, affect climate change on a global scale by creating
better systems,"" said Wadiak, whose chickens went on sale in
April and will soon be available across the United States.
""Grow the food where your animals are and do it in a way
that is restorative to the soil, increase drought resistance and
reduce propensity for desertification,"" he told the Thomson
Reuters Foundation.
Wadiak and his team are now working with dozens of farmers
to convert more than 5,000 acres (2,000 hectares) of farmland
into ""regenerative agriculture"" - the kind that improves soil
health and increases its ability to store carbon.
""Any time you're growing feed crops or crops in general in a
regenerative system, you're mitigating climate change because we
are sequestering carbon, plain and simple,"" said Wadiak.
His company Cooks Venture recently received $12 million in
funding and is looking to expand into breeding pigs and cattle,
even as calls to cut meat consumption for environmental reasons
grow louder.
""I'm all for people eating less meat, but it would be naive
to think that people are going to stop eating it,"" said Wadiak.
Chicken is the world's most popular meat, with 66.5 million

              <p>The rescued men and women, some as young as 20 and others 60

              <p>LONDON, Oct 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - An elegant and
ultra energy-efficient street of new social homes should help
inspire a new generation of public housing after it won
Britain's most prestigious architecture prize, said housing
experts on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The publicly-funded Goldsmith Street in the eastern city of
Norwich was hailed as a ""modest masterpiece"" by judges as it
became the first social housing development to win the Stirling
Prize for Britain's best new building.</p>
              <p>""What is interesting about the Goldsmith Street development
is it shows that councils can build high-quality housing in
cities,"" Anthony Breach, an analyst with the Centre for Cities,
a policy research charity, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p>The win for Goldsmith Street, which was funded by Norwich

LONDON, Oct 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - An elegant and
ultra energy-efficient street of new social homes should help
inspire a new generation of public housing after it won
Britain's most prestigious architecture prize, said housing
experts on Wednesday.
The publicly-funded Goldsmith Street in the eastern city of
Norwich was hailed as a ""modest masterpiece"" by judges as it
became the first social housing development to win the Stirling
Prize for Britain's best new building.
""What is interesting about the Goldsmith Street development
is it shows that councils can build high-quality housing in
cities,"" Anthony Breach, an analyst with the Centre for Cities,
a policy research charity, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
The win for Goldsmith Street, which was funded by Norwich
City Council, comes as Britain faces sluggish public
housebuilding and rising homelessness in many cities.
England is failing to build the number of homes it needs,
according to a briefing paper from parliament last year, but
councils have dramatically reduced building over recent years in
the face of budget cuts.
Councils completed more than 115,000 homes across England in
1975, government data shows, but by 2018 they built just 2,640,
adding to pressure for housing and especially affordable homes.
More than 80,000 households were living in temporary
accommodation in England last year, according to government
data, while about 4,500 people were sleeping rough.
Goldsmith Street was designed to complement nearby
Victorian-era homes and offer shared space for residents while
its environmentally-friendly construction cuts energy bills,
which is critical for reducing cities' planet-warming emissions.
The homes are positioned to draw warmth from the sun, with
thick walls retaining heat and consideration for energy
efficiency stretching to small details such as the creation of
external letterboxes to prevent draughts through the front door.
It also includes an alleyway for children to play in, while
parking was pushed to the edges of the development to ensure
that cars do not dominate the public space.
""Goldsmith Street is a modest masterpiece,"" said the judges
in a statement announcing the prize.
""These desirable, spacious, low-energy properties should be
the norm for all council housing.""
The development should act as ""a pioneering exemplar for

of Santiago, El Pelícano, equipped with 250,000 panels.
Juan Villalobos, who drove diesel buses for three decades
before switching to the electric models less than a year
ago, said residents value and take pride in the new buses.
""You hear no noise when you're driving - it's like a ghost
sliding through the streets. People care for them much better
too. There's far more respect for the buses and fewer problems
with the passengers,"" Villalobos said.
""People even let the old buses pass by so that they can ride
the new ones,"" the veteran driver noted.

              <p>SOUTH 24 PARGANAS, India/DHAKA, Oct 9 (Thomson Reuters
Foundation) - P riya was 15 when a relative in Bangladesh tricked
her with the promise of a dream job as a singer, drugged her,
and trafficked her across the border into the sex trade in
India.</p>
              <p>After several failed attempts to escape the brothel in the
eastern state of West Bengal where she was trapped for six
years, Priya was rescued along with other girls from Bangladesh
and India in a raid by police and anti-trafficking campaigners.</p>
              <p>Heading home and pursuing her musical ambitions beckoned, or
so she thought. But three years after her rescue, the prospects
of making it back to her family appeared ever more distant.</p>
              <p>For Priya, now 24, was one of about 180 Bangladeshi sex
trafficking survivors stuck in shelters in West Bengal - with
many having waited years for official clearance to go home due
to complex and lengthy bureaucracy across the two countries.</p>
              <p>""How long can I wait?"", said Priya, using her 'brothel name'
to hide her identity for fear of being shamed in Bangladesh.</p>
              <p>""Maybe I won't go now even if they ask me to,"" she said last
month at a shelter, sitting in a room adorned with paper roses.</p>
              <p>Victims wishing to return home must first gain approval from
police, social workers, judges, border forces and bureaucrats at
both state and federal level, a process that involves about 15
steps, analysis by the Thomson Reuters Foundation has revealed.</p>
              <p>While the two nations are working towards faster returns,
the long waits facing dozens of survivors could stymie their
efforts to start life afresh back home and leave them vulnerable
to being trafficked again, according to activists.</p>
              <p>""Living in a shelter ... can be traumatic,"" said Tariqul
Islam of Justice and Care, a charity that reintegrates victims
in Bangladesh. ""When they return after two years or more, it
becomes hard for them to adjust to the changes and recover.""</p>
              <p>""Traffickers often keep track of their victims even after
they return home. When they notice that the girl does not have a
job, or is finding it hard to adjust, they target her again.""</p>

              <p>FASTER RETURNS AFOOT</p>
              <p>Thousands of Bangladeshis are trafficked to India each year
- many of whom are sold into prostitution or domestic servitude
- anti-slavery activists say, although official data is lacking.</p>
              <p>In the last eight years, Bangladesh has brought home about
1,750 trafficking survivors from India, predominantly women and
girls in West Bengal and the western state of Maharashtra.</p>
              <p>However anti-slavery charities that help victims in India
say most are kept in shelters for years - first awaiting the
conclusion of court proceedings, then the repatriation process.</p>
              <p>Justice is often slow and convictions are rare. One in four
trafficking cases in India leads to conviction, while in
Bangladesh, only 30 convictions have been secured under a 2012
law, with more than 4,000 cases still awaiting trial.</p>
              <p>India and Bangladesh signed a partnership in 2015 to speed
up repatriations, but how a victim is treated - whether it is
their experience with the judiciary or the wait to go home -
varies from one Indian state to another, according to activists.</p>
              <p>A long-awaited deal aimed at streamlining the system is to
be finalised soon, officials from the two governments said.</p>
              <p>""At the moment it sometimes takes 18 to 22 months,"" said
Ferdousi Akhter, joint secretary with Bangladesh's interior
ministry. Yet charities say it can drag on for up to six years.</p>
              <p>""A victim has to go through many layers to be repatriated
from India,"" Akhter added. ""We are in talks to cut down these
layers ... victims can surely make faster returns.""</p>

              <p>In a small house on the outskirts of Bangladesh's capital
Dhaka, mother-of-two Basiron remembered the call to say her
missing daughters had been found in a brothel in India a year
after they disappeared.</p>
              <p>""When I heard the news, I screamed! I felt as though my
heart was going to burst,"" the 47-year-old single parent said.</p>
              <p>The girls - now aged 16 and 17 - were rescued in 2017 from a
brothel in West Bengal where they were held in one room, beaten,
plied with drink and drugs until addicted, and repeatedly raped.</p>
              <p>Two years on, they are still waiting to go home.</p>
              <p>Charges against the 16 people arrested in their trafficking
case are yet to be filed in court, which refused them permission
to return and testify from Bangladesh.</p>
              <p>At a shelter for trafficking victims in a village in West
Bengal, the two sisters showed off sketches of huts surrounded
by trees and a river - their way of remembering home.</p>
              <p>The younger girl, Neela, said she wanted to take out a loan
and set up a beauty parlour when she finally returns home.</p>
              <p>""The Indian girls who were rescued with us went back home in
no time,"" said Neela, whose right arm was covered with scars -
evidence of self-harm during her time in the brothel.</p>
              <p>""We feel happy for them. Maybe we too will go back one day.""</p>
              <p>Basiron and her daughters stay in touch through occasional

over their return and is increasingly worried for their safety.</p>

              <p>West Bengal has a 21-week deadline for a rescued victim to
be sent back home but it is rarely met, state officials said,
due to lengthy court cases in India and the time it takes
Bangladesh to confirm that a survivor is one of its citizens.</p>
              <p>That is due to the high volume of cases, the fact that some
victims do not share their home addresses for fear of reprisals
against their families, and because relatives cannot always
identify them easily after years apart.</p>
              <p>To ensure faster returns, India has started sharing photos
of victims with Bangladeshi officials over the past year, having
previously just provided their name, sex and age.</p>
              <p>Sitting at her desk, state government anti-trafficking
consultant Madhumita Haldar showed two photos of a teenage
Bangladeshi victim on her smartphone. In one she was wearing a
headscarf, in the other her face was covered in garish make-up.</p>
              <p>""But how is a parent supposed to recognise their child from
this?"" she asked, surrounded by victim case files stacked high.</p>
              <p>More than 80% of the 180 female trafficking victims in West
Bengal waiting to go home still have not had their nationality
verified by Bangladesh and some have been waiting for over a
year, Haldar said.</p>
              <p>A Bangladeshi officer who declined to be named said police
never took more than six weeks to complete the process, despite
some delays in verifying victims' addresses.</p>
              <p>Yet in one case, a teenage girl died of acute abdominal pain
that shelter officials later linked to her withdrawal from
alcohol and drugs as she waited for her repatriation order to be
completed by Bangladesh, according to activist Tapoti Bhowmick.</p>

              <p>BOGOTA, Oct 8 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Drug
trafficking and organised crime are fuelling deforestation in
protected tropical forests and national parks across Central
America, causing substantial economic losses, researchers said
on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Traffickers are cutting down trees to build roads and
airstrips to transport cocaine and are encroaching ever further
into more remote forest areas to evade anti-narcotics
operations, according to two separate studies on the problem.</p>
              <p>""Narco-deforestation now affects large tropical forests in
Guatemala, Honduras (and) Nicaragua, and is beginning to affect
Costa Rica as well,"" Jennifer A. Devine, assistant geography
professor at Texas State University and co-author of the
studies, said in a statement.</p>
              <p>Protected mangrove and wetland areas in coastal parts of
Honduras and Costa Rica are ""attractive for supplying maritime
routes and warehousing cocaine"", researchers wrote.</p>
              <p>Environmental degradation caused by drug trafficking leads
to losses of about $215 million annually in natural and cultural
resources across Central America's protected forest areas,
showed estimates by report co-author Bernardo Aguilar-Gonzalez.</p>
              <p>""That is more than double the conservation budget the
region's governments allocate to the forest areas,"" noted
Aguilar-Gonzalez, who heads Fundacion Neotropica, a Costa Rican
nonprofit that promotes community management of natural
resources.</p>
              <p>Ensuring forest communities have secure land tenure,
including collective land titles, and allowing them to decide
how their land should be managed could help deter trafficking
and slow deforestation, researchers said.</p>
              <p>Areas that are managed by communities record ""very low
forest losses"", they added.</p>
              <p>""Investing in community land rights and participatory
governance in protected areas is a key strategy to combat drug
trafficking and climate change simultaneously,"" Aguilar-Gonzalez
said in a statement.</p>
              <p>Forest protection has come under the spotlight as a low-cost
way to keep climate change in check because trees store
planet-warming carbon. They release it when they are burned or
rot.</p>
              <p>Deforestation rates have risen in the world's tropical
regions, while Latin American countries have also been
struggling to curb forest fires in the Amazon this year.</p>
              <p>The forest research was presented at a meeting in Costa Rica
this week to examine progress on the 2015 Paris Agreement to
tackle climate change, including commitments to cut greenhouse
gas emissions, ahead of December's U.N. climate talks in Chile.

BOGOTA, Oct 8 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Drug
trafficking and organised crime are fuelling deforestation in
protected tropical forests and national parks across Central
America, causing substantial economic losses, researchers said
on Tuesday.
Traffickers are cutting down trees to build roads and
airstrips to transport cocaine and are encroaching ever further
into more remote forest areas to evade anti-narcotics
operations, according to two separate studies on the problem.
""Narco-deforestation now affects large tropical forests in
Guatemala, Honduras (and) Nicaragua, and is beginning to affect
Costa Rica as well,"" Jennifer A. Devine, assistant geography
professor at Texas State University and co-author of the
studies, said in a statement.
Protected mangrove and wetland areas in coastal parts of
Honduras and Costa Rica are ""attractive for supplying maritime
routes and warehousing cocaine"", researchers wrote.
Environmental degradation caused by drug trafficking leads
to losses of about $215 million annually in natural and cultural
resources across Central America's protected forest areas,
showed estimates by report co-author Bernardo Aguilar-Gonzalez.
""That is more than double the conservation budget the
region's governments allocate to the forest areas,"" noted
Aguilar-Gonzalez, who heads Fundacion Neotropica, a Costa Rican
nonprofit that promotes community management of natural
resources.
Ensuring forest communities have secure land tenure,
including collective land titles, and allowing them to decide
how their land should be managed could help deter trafficking
and slow deforestation, researchers said.
Areas that are managed by communities record ""very low
forest losses"", they added.
""Investing in community land rights and participatory
governance in protected areas is a key strategy to combat drug
trafficking and climate change simultaneously,"" Aguilar-Gonzalez
said in a statement.
Forest protection has come under the spotlight as a low-cost
way to keep climate change in check because trees store
planet-warming carbon. They release it when they are burned or
rot.
Deforestation rates have risen in the world's tropical
regions, while Latin American countries have also been
struggling to curb forest fires in the Amazon this year.
The forest research was presented at a meeting in Costa Rica
this week to examine progress on the 2015 Paris Agreement to
tackle climate change, including commitments to cut greenhouse
gas emissions, ahead of December's U.N. climate talks in Chile.

              <p>LONDON, Oct 8 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When Eccie
Newton and her sister began making fresh salads and sandwiches
to deliver to London office workers, their start-up company
Karma Cans became so popular they soon had to expand - and hit a
common roadblock: space.</p>
              <p>""We just couldn't find any kitchen space - it was almost
impossible,"" Newton recalled of their venture in 2014.</p>
              <p>So, the 29-year-old set up her own ""dark kitchen"", a
catering warehouse in Hackney - a hipster area in east London -
that hosts about 85 catering businesses making culinary delights
from granola to kimchi and cold-brew coffee.</p>
              <p>Dark kitchens - also known as ""virtual"" or ""ghost"" kitchens
- take their name from large retail warehouses that cater
directly to online customers, bypassing stores.</p>
              <p>Often in under-utilised buildings, portacabins or warehouses
on the outskirts of cities, dark kitchens allow chefs to cook up
everything from burgers to biryanis and serve food directly to
online consumers.</p>
              <p>The rapid rise of these food factories has some property
experts predicting the death of bricks-and-mortar restaurants
and, subsequently, local high streets in Britain as online
deliveries become the norm.</p>
              <p>""As it plays out, it's going to put a lot more pressure on
the high street,"" which could mean people going out less to
socialise or lead to the loss of local jobs, said independent
professional property buyer Jonathan Rolande.</p>
              <p>But fans of the no-frills kitchens say they offer a new
lease of life to abandoned properties and help small catering
brands compete.</p>
              <p>Newton sees the new properties as being akin to co-working
spaces, which are also increasingly common in cities.</p>
              <p>Often regulated to the same standards as restaurants, far
from replacing them, dark kitchens provide a ""complement to food
culture"", she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p>""The teams that work in virtual restaurants in our kitchen
... they're run exactly like a team in a restaurant - it's not
robots making your food, it's real people,"" said Newton.</p>
              <p>FOOD FOR THOUGHT</p>
              <p>From New York to Shanghai, hungry city dwellers in search of
food are increasingly reaching for a phone, rather than heading
to the kitchen, using apps such as Uber Eats and Deliveroo.</p>
              <p>In Britain, there were almost 5 million fewer trips to
full-service restaurants in the 12 weeks to March 24, 2019,
compared with a year earlier, according to data analytics firm
Kantar.</p>
              <p>Dark kitchens, originally popular with small, independent
food companies, have gained favour with larger chains too.</p>
              <p>Firms such as noodle restaurant Wagamama are
joining the trend to provide customers with their food in places
where they lack a physical restaurant presence or where demand
for online delivery is high.</p>
              <p>Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick is joining the
bandwagon with his CloudKitchens venture, a delivery-only ""smart
kitchen"" enterprise that rents out catering spaces and provides
its clients with marketing support.</p>
              <p>In CloudKitchens' first attempt to crack an overseas market
since Kalanik bought its parent company last year, the Los
Angeles-based firm started operations in South Korea in May.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>OUT OF BUSINESS</p>
              <p>The boom in online food delivery services comes with a raft
of social implications, according to property experts.</p>
              <p>Rolande envisages that as food delivery apps become the
norm, big restaurant brands could be ""in a position to walk away
from high streets"".</p>
              <p>Prominent British television chef Jamie Oliver shuttered
most of his UK restaurants in May, culling about 1,000 jobs as
his restaurant chain Jamie's Italian went into administration.</p>
              <p>Two months earlier, the Boparan Restaurant Group announced
it was going to close more than a third of its Giraffe and Ed's
Easy Diner outlets.</p>
              <p>And well-known chains Carluccio's, Prezzo, Strada and
Gourmet Burger Kitchen all closed branches in 2018.</p>
              <p>Rolande said the convenience of ordering food online likely
contributed to those closures, and that the growth of dark
kitchens could help fill property space that would otherwise sit
empty.</p>
              <p>But he does not think this will necessarily bring economic
benefits to the communities in which they are located.</p>
              <p>More likely, he said, society could well get to the point
where people no longer require kitchens in their own homes.</p>
              <p>""In central London, you could start to get people building

              <p>That future may not be far off, with some homes in places
like Bangkok and Singapore - where a plethora of street food and
online eateries exist - already being built with shared or only
partial kitchen facilities.</p>
              <p>To ensure local businesses do not lose out however, cities

economy, where convenience and speed are key.</p>
              <p>But far from contributing to the death of the high street,
Outtrim said such sites could help ""fill gaps"" in the reach of

in areas where they cannot or do not want to rent a space.</p>

              <p>Dark kitchens are far cheaper to lease, said restaurant
property expert David Rawlinson, who has scouted properties for

              <p>Rent on a communal kitchen in the city averages 25 pounds

for delivery bikes and car bays, and the system may not be

              <p>In London, Newton's communal kitchen business is thriving,
she said, with six new sites planned across the capital in the

FOOD FOR THOUGHT
From New York to Shanghai, hungry city dwellers in search of
food are increasingly reaching for a phone, rather than heading
to the kitchen, using apps such as Uber Eats and Deliveroo.
In Britain, there were almost 5 million fewer trips to
full-service restaurants in the 12 weeks to March 24, 2019,
compared with a year earlier, according to data analytics firm

In CloudKitchens' first attempt to crack an overseas market

Angeles-based firm started operations in South Korea in May.

OUT OF BUSINESS
The boom in online food delivery services comes with a raft
of social implications, according to property experts.
Rolande envisages that as food delivery apps become the
norm, big restaurant brands could be ""in a position to walk away
from high streets"".
Prominent British television chef Jamie Oliver shuttered
most of his UK restaurants in May, culling about 1,000 jobs as
his restaurant chain Jamie's Italian went into administration.

it was going to close more than a third of its Giraffe and Ed's

              <p>NAIROBI, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Thousands of
gay men in Africa are likely dying from HIV-related illnesses
every year due to homophobic laws that stifle their chances of
being tested and treated, said researchers behind a study
published on Monday in The Lancet HIV journal.</p>
              <p>A study of the data of 45,000 gay men in 28 African
countries including Kenya, Malawi and Nigeria found only one in
four living with HIV were taking medication.</p>
              <p>Half had taken an HIV/AIDS test in the past 12 months and
researchers said the low rates were due to anti-LGBT+ laws in
many African countries, which promoted stigma and discrimination
and neglected HIV/AIDS programmes targeting gay men.</p>
              <p>""We found countries that had more repressive anti-LGBT laws
or harsher penalties for same sex relations had lower levels of
HIV testing,"" said Kate Mitchell, one of the researchers at
Imperial College London who was involved in the study.</p>
              <p>""Some of the studies suggested that this was due to stigma.
More research is required to see whether, if these laws were
repealed, more gay men would be tested and treated.""</p>
              <p>According to the United Nations, about 470,000 people living
with HIV in Africa still die every year because they cannot or
do not get tested and gain access to treatment, accounting for
more than 60 percent of all global HIV-related deaths.</p>
              <p>While there are no official figures on the number of deaths
of men who have sex with men (MSM), Mitchell said it would be
fair to estimate that thousands of gay men who were unaware or
unable to get medication were dying every year.</p>
              <p>African countries have some of the world's most prohibitive
laws governing homosexuality. Same-sex relationships are
considered taboo and gay sex is a crime across most of
continent, with punishments ranging from imprisonment to death.</p>
              <p>A 2019 report by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,
Trans and Intersex Association found 32 African countries out of
a total of 54 nations criminalize same sex relations. South
Africa is the only African nation to legalise gay marriage.</p>
              <p>Gay rights groups say the laws promote homophobia across the
continent and are used daily to persecute and discriminate
against sexual minorities who face prejudice in getting jobs,
renting housing or seeking medical care or education.</p>
              <p>Hate crimes like blackmail, extortion, physical and sexual
assault are common - but most are too fearful to go to the
police due to their sexual orientation, say rights groups.</p>
              <p>""Globally, men who have sex with men are about 28 times
more likely to be living with HIV than men in the general
population, an inequality that is particularly apparent in
sub-Saharan Africa, where the human rights of MSM are often
violated,"" said the study.</p>
              <p>""These attitudes also create barriers to implementing
effective HIV research, policy and health programmes for MSM,
through prohibition of activism and research, arbitrary arrests
of health-care providers, and disruption of services provided by
community-based and non-governmental organisations.""</p>
              <p>LGBT+ rights campaigners in Kenya, where gay sex is
punishable by up to 14 years in jail, said they were not
surprised by the results of the study.</p>
              <p>""It is true the law makes if very difficult for MSM to seek
medical treatment. Many people fear they will be outed or face
some kind of abuse or be shamed by insensitive medical
practitioners,"" said Andrew Maina, programme coordinator at
HIVOS.</p>
              <p>""If these anti-gay laws are scrapped, there will be more
openness, more advocacy and more awareness of the issue. Gay men
living with HIV would be able to seek medical care knowing they
will be treated with respect and dignity.""</p>

More research is required to see whether, if these laws were
repealed, more gay men would be tested and treated.""
According to the United Nations, about 470,000 people living
with HIV in Africa still die every year because they cannot or
do not get tested and gain access to treatment, accounting for
more than 60 percent of all global HIV-related deaths.
While there are no official figures on the number of deaths
of men who have sex with men (MSM), Mitchell said it would be
fair to estimate that thousands of gay men who were unaware or
unable to get medication were dying every year.
African countries have some of the world's most prohibitive
laws governing homosexuality. Same-sex relationships are
considered taboo and gay sex is a crime across most of
continent, with punishments ranging from imprisonment to death.
A 2019 report by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,
Trans and Intersex Association found 32 African countries out of
a total of 54 nations criminalize same sex relations. South
Africa is the only African nation to legalise gay marriage.
Gay rights groups say the laws promote homophobia across the
continent and are used daily to persecute and discriminate
against sexual minorities who face prejudice in getting jobs,
renting housing or seeking medical care or education.
Hate crimes like blackmail, extortion, physical and sexual
assault are common - but most are too fearful to go to the
police due to their sexual orientation, say rights groups.
""Globally, men who have sex with men are about 28 times
more likely to be living with HIV than men in the general
population, an inequality that is particularly apparent in
sub-Saharan Africa, where the human rights of MSM are often
violated,"" said the study.
""These attitudes also create barriers to implementing
effective HIV research, policy and health programmes for MSM,
through prohibition of activism and research, arbitrary arrests
of health-care providers, and disruption of services provided by
community-based and non-governmental organisations.""
LGBT+ rights campaigners in Kenya, where gay sex is
punishable by up to 14 years in jail, said they were not
surprised by the results of the study.
""It is true the law makes if very difficult for MSM to seek
medical treatment. Many people fear they will be outed or face
some kind of abuse or be shamed by insensitive medical
practitioners,"" said Andrew Maina, programme coordinator at
HIVOS.
""If these anti-gay laws are scrapped, there will be more
openness, more advocacy and more awareness of the issue. Gay men
living with HIV would be able to seek medical care knowing they
will be treated with respect and dignity.""

              <p>LONDON, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Film star Cate
Blanchett called on Monday for the world to end the
""devastating"" plight of millions of people with no nationality
amid warnings that rising xenophobia is stymieing efforts to
meet a 2024 deadline for eradicating statelessness.</p>
              <p>The double Oscar-winner said statelessness prevented people
fulfilling their potential, and was a ""heartbreaking"" waste of
human talent.</p>
              <p>Blanchett threw her weight behind the global #Ibelong
campaign to end statelessness as she addressed an
intergovernmental meeting in Geneva aimed at dramatically
escalating progress.</p>
              <p>Her support will boost attention on an issue that has long
been neglected.</p>
              <p>Not recognised as nationals of any country, stateless people
are often deprived of basic rights like education and
healthcare, and risk exploitation and detention.</p>
              <p>Blanchett held up her own passport, credit card and Medicare
card as she urged ministers and government officials to imagine
how difficult life would be if they had no documents.</p>
              <p>""It's a condition of invisibility,"" she said. ""Stateless
people are unseen and unheard.""</p>
              <p>Blanchett, a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. refugee agency
(UNHCR), interviewed Maha Mamo, a formerly stateless activist
who has become a torchbearer for #Ibelong, describing her as an
""extraordinary beacon of hope"".</p>
              <p>The activist, who speaks five languages, told delegates how
her hopes of studying medicine and joining a Lebanese basketball
team were crushed because she had no papers.</p>
              <p>The Geneva meeting comes halfway through the #Ibelong
initiative launched in 2014.</p>
              <p>But the task ahead is monumental. Only about 200,000 people
acquired citizenship during the first half of the campaign,
barely making a dent in the overall number.</p>
              <p>And U.N. officials admit the total may now be even higher
than in 2014 because of increasing displacement triggered by
crises in Syria, Venezuela and elsewhere, which has raised the
risk of many children growing up stateless.</p>
              <p>There is also no solution in sight for many of the largest
groups of stateless people including the Rohingya, hundreds of
thousands of whom have fled to Bangladesh following an upsurge
in violence.</p>
              <p>U.N. officials are also keeping a close eye on India, where
1.9 million people in the northeastern state of Assam have been
left off a register of citizens, stoking concerns that many
could become stateless.</p>
              <p>UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi said global awareness of the
repercussions of statelessness was growing and they had received
more than 170 pledges of action ahead of the meeting.</p>
              <p>But he warned that ""damaging forms of nationalism"" and the
""manipulation of anti-refugee and migrant sentiment"" were
putting progress at risk.</p>
              <p>DOGS HAVE MORE RIGHTS</p>
              <p>People end up stateless for a host of reasons including
migration, flawed citizenship laws and ethnic discrimination.
Others fall through the cracks when countries break up.</p>
              <p>Aside from Myanmar, there are big stateless groups in Ivory
Coast, Thailand, Nepal, Kuwait and some former Soviet countries.</p>
              <p>Stateless people have previously told the Thomson Reuters
Foundation that they feel stigmatised and forgotten.</p>
              <p>""We've had people telling us, 'dogs are more important than
I am',"" said Melanie Khanna, head of the UNHCR's statelessness
section.</p>
              <p>""People feel totally scarred and isolated. They often say,
'I thought it was just me'. It sends chills down your spine.""</p>
              <p>Almost all countries are represented at the Geneva meeting,
with some 1,000 delegates including a number of ministers. U.N.
officials say the pledges will provide a roadmap for
accelerating the campaign.</p>
              <p>In July, Kyrgyzstan made history when it became the first
country to officially end statelessness. U.N. officials believe
Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan could also meet the
2024 deadline.</p>
              <p>Thailand, where nearly 479,000 people are stateless,
including members of ethnic hill tribes in the northern border
regions, is also stepping up action.</p>
              <p>The issue made international headlines last year during
rescue efforts to save a young Thai football team trapped in a
flooded cave.</p>
              <p>During the drama it emerged that several of the boys and
their coach were stateless. They were granted citizenship after
their ordeal.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>WIN-WIN</p>
              <p>But resolving statelessness is not just a human rights
issue. Statelessness has fuelled conflict and displacement in
both Myanmar and Ivory Coast.</p>
              <p>Khanna said there was a growing recognition that resolving
statelessness was a ""win-win"" because it was in governments'
interests to have everybody feel invested in the society they
lived in and motivated to contribute.</p>
              <p>The U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of
global pledges on tackling poverty, inequality and other ills
with an overall ambition to ""to leave no one behind"", have
helped shift attitudes, Khanna said.</p>
              <p>""The SDGs have allowed us to talk about this whole area as a
development issue and not just a human rights one,"" she added.</p>
              <p>""This makes a lot of sense because you don't want
disenfranchised, impoverished people on your territory.""</p>
              <p>Khanna said an increasing number of countries were changing
their nationality laws and policies to prevent future
generations ending up in limbo.</p>
              <p>Colombia, for example, has announced it will give
citizenship to thousands of children born to Venezuelan migrants
to prevent them growing up stateless.</p>
              <p>Other countries have scrapped discriminatory laws that
prevent women passing their citizenship to their children - a
major cause of statelessness.</p>
              <p>The impact of such laws has been clearly seen during the
Syrian war with many displaced mothers unable to obtain
documents for their children where the father is dead or absent.</p>
              <p>Iran became the latest country to pass reforms last week.</p>
              <p>There has also been a flurry of countries joining the U.N.
conventions on protecting stateless people and preventing
statelessness.</p>
              <p>The 1961 convention stipulates that a state must grant
nationality to anyone born on its territory who would otherwise
be stateless - a safeguard that would wipe out most new cases of
statelessness if adopted by all countries.</p>
              <p>Blanchett appealed to all nations to give stateless people
""their basic human right to belong"", adding that solutions were
often straightforward.
""It is a man-made problem and it is solvable,"" she said.

DOGS HAVE MORE RIGHTS
People end up stateless for a host of reasons including
migration, flawed citizenship laws and ethnic discrimination.
Others fall through the cracks when countries break up.
Aside from Myanmar, there are big stateless groups in Ivory
Coast, Thailand, Nepal, Kuwait and some former Soviet countries.
Stateless people have previously told the Thomson Reuters
Foundation that they feel stigmatised and forgotten.
""We've had people telling us, 'dogs are more important than

Thailand, where nearly 479,000 people are stateless,
including members of ethnic hill tribes in the northern border

The issue made international headlines last year during
rescue efforts to save a young Thai football team trapped in a

During the drama it emerged that several of the boys and

WIN-WIN
But resolving statelessness is not just a human rights
issue. Statelessness has fuelled conflict and displacement in
both Myanmar and Ivory Coast.
Khanna said there was a growing recognition that resolving
statelessness was a ""win-win"" because it was in governments'
interests to have everybody feel invested in the society they
lived in and motivated to contribute.
The U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of
global pledges on tackling poverty, inequality and other ills
with an overall ambition to ""to leave no one behind"", have
helped shift attitudes, Khanna said.
""The SDGs have allowed us to talk about this whole area as a
development issue and not just a human rights one,"" she added.
""This makes a lot of sense because you don't want
disenfranchised, impoverished people on your territory.""
Khanna said an increasing number of countries were changing
their nationality laws and policies to prevent future
generations ending up in limbo.
Colombia, for example, has announced it will give
citizenship to thousands of children born to Venezuelan migrants
to prevent them growing up stateless.
Other countries have scrapped discriminatory laws that
prevent women passing their citizenship to their children - a
major cause of statelessness.
The impact of such laws has been clearly seen during the
Syrian war with many displaced mothers unable to obtain
documents for their children where the father is dead or absent.
Iran became the latest country to pass reforms last week.
There has also been a flurry of countries joining the U.N.
conventions on protecting stateless people and preventing
statelessness.
The 1961 convention stipulates that a state must grant
nationality to anyone born on its territory who would otherwise
be stateless - a safeguard that would wipe out most new cases of
statelessness if adopted by all countries.
Blanchett appealed to all nations to give stateless people
""their basic human right to belong"", adding that solutions were
often straightforward.
""It is a man-made problem and it is solvable,"" she said.

              <p>NIAMEY, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Abdulaziz,
Aminatu, Absatu, Abdulmanaf. Fahad. And, well, also Mansour.
They are the names Zeinab Garba has in mind for any future
children she has.</p>
              <p>But for now the mother of two has decided to set aside plans
for more offspring by using a contraceptive, to give a better
future to Rachid, her restless 3-year-old boy, and her newborn
son Bilyaminou, mostly a passionate sleeper for now.</p>
              <p>""I'm proud to wear the (contraceptive) implant,"" said Garba,
20.</p>
              <p>In a country with the world's highest birth rate per woman,
hers is an uncommon move and, to some, a controversial one.</p>
              <p>But environmentalists and youth activists in Niger hope it
is one more families will embrace, to help reduce threats from
the destructive effects of a changing climate.</p>
              <p>Climate change has meant Niger has seen a swift rise in
temperatures and less abundant water flows in rivers, in
addition to more intense droughts and floods, said Issa Lele, a
meteorologist with the United Nations Development Programme.</p>
              <p>That is a growing threat to food and water supplies - and
the pressures heighten as the nation's population booms, with
each woman having on average 7.6 children, said Sani Ayouba, the
director of environmental group Young Volunteers for the
Environment.</p>
              <p>""We're not saying to stop having children,"" Ayouba, who has
three offspring of his own, said at a September meeting with
local non-profit leaders, prompting a wave of laughter.</p>
              <p>Instead, he said, his group advocates the use of
contraceptives to slow the rate of births - a relief to one
listener who said he was expecting his fifth child.</p>
              <p>Around the world, a rising global population is increasing
pressure on the world's limited resources, with every additional
person in need of food, transport, energy and other resources
that drive climate change.</p>
              <p>That pressure is worst in the richest countries, where each
additional person consumes far more resources than an added
child in a poorer country.</p>
              <p>But very high birthrates in places like Niger also mean the
country's own limited resources must be shared among more people
- a particular problem as climate change disrupts farming and
herding, threatening food supplies.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>EFFECTIVE - BUT CONTROVERSIAL</p>
              <p>At the clinic where Garba was getting a contraceptive
implant on a September afternoon, in the district of Talladje in
Niamey, herds of cows made their way to pasture just outside.</p>
              <p>She breathed deeply when a midwife poked two tiny holes in
her arm with a needle and slid in the small, elongated implant.</p>
              <p>The five-minute procedure will give her three years without
a pregnancy, with a 99% effectiveness rate, the midwife said.</p>
              <p>The pill is by far the most popular birth control method in
Niger, but at this clinic of the international charity Marie
Stopes it is an implant, placed under the skin, that most women
seek, said Adama Abdoulaye, a doctor who coordinates the clinic.</p>
              <p>More women like Garba streamed in and out of the center's
waiting room, glancing at soap operas playing on the television.</p>
              <p>Nigerien authorites back some aspects of family planning,
and have begun to allocate money toward the push, said Issoufou
Harou, director of family planning at Niger's Ministry of Public
Health.</p>
              <p>But a national budget of 200 million FCFA ($340,000) for
purchasing contraceptives doesn't go far enough, said Salamatou
Traore, president of the Coalition of Stakeholders for the
Repositioning of Family Planning in Niger.</p>
              <p>Even that budget - and Garba's tiny implant - raise big
questions in this highly devout Islamic society, however.</p>
              <p>Some 99% of Nigerians are Muslim, census data shows, and
Islam does not advocate limiting the number of children in a
family if they are well cared for, said Sita Amadou of the
Islamic Association of Niger, the chief Islamic organisation in
the country.</p>
              <p>That complicates the ambitious plans of environmental
activists who since last year have been working to spread family
planning as a buffer against the effects of climate change in
Niger.</p>
              <p>The activists have met with parliamentarians and cabinet
ministers, as well as a range of community groups.</p>
              <p>At a recent gathering, in a small, damp room in Niamey, a
dozen representatives listened, silently at first, to the pitch
about a novel way of fighting growing climate pressures.</p>
              <p>""It's not just about investing in agriculture so that it is
organic or sustainable but also in contraceptive methods and
family planning everywhere,"" said Ayouba, who spoke alongside
Issa Garba, who heads the Nigerien Youth Network on Climate
Change.</p>
              <p>But worries quickly arose from a handful of listeners.
Muslim authorities will not accept the proposal, one participant
commented.</p>
              <p>Ayouba and Garba said current projections - which show the
population of Niger tripling by 2050, from 22 million people
today, according to U.N. estimates - are untenable.</p>
              <p>By some estimates, Niamey, Niger's sleepy capital of 1
million, could become one of the 10 largest cities in Africa by
2100, with as many as 50 million residents as a result of
population growth and urbanisation, European scientists said in
the journal Earth's Future earlier this year.</p>
              <p>The country's 2012-2020 Action Plan for Family Planning
commits to making contraceptives available to half of the
population by next year - though their availability is less than
20% for now, government data shows.</p>
              <p>But Niger's population growth rate is not simply the result
of lack of access to contraception, said Abdou Batouati, a
researcher at the Institute for Research in Human Sciences at
Niamey's Abdou Moumouni University.</p>
              <p>""Culturally, in Niger, women space out their births at a
rate of a child every two years,"" he said.</p>
              <p>In the city's open markets, among bars of soap, stalls of
lemons and the calls of salesmen, some vendors sell boxes of
contraceptive pills, stacked in colorful towers atop trays
carried on the vendors' heads.</p>
              <p>The Pharmacy du Point, in the affluent district of Plateau,
also sells them. On a table, the manager spreads out rectangular
peach, blue and orange boxes of the contraceptives, which sell
for anywhere from 300 to 3,060 FCFA ($0.50 to $5.10).</p>
              <p>But some people think that the pill ""is a way to get people
into debauchery,"" said Adama Jonathna, a midwife at the clinic
that helped Garba with her contraceptive implant.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>IN THE PLAN?</p>
              <p>Niger is currently a national plan on how it will adapt to
climate threats, aiming to integrate those efforts into
government planning and budgeting.</p>
              <p>In what would be a pioneering move, it may include a section
noting the links between boosting family planning and lessening
climate change impacts.</p>
              <p>""I do not mind doing it, but before that I need to have the
approval of my officials"" to do so, said Gousmane Moussa, the
plan's liaison to national authorities.</p>
              <p>He said U.N. guidelines that inform such adaptation plans do
not urge family planning be a part of them.</p>
              <p>Should Niger make clear the link between reducing birthrates
and lowering climate risks, it might be the first such case in a
national plan, said Christian Ledwell, an adaptation plan
specialist at the International Institute for Sustainable
Development, a Canadian think tank.</p>
              <p>But the idea ruffles plenty of feathers in the Sahelian
country.</p>
              <p>While preparing for the afternoon prayer on the campus of
the Abdou Moumouni University, Laminou Adamou Abdoul Azize - a
member of the Association of Muslim Students of Niger - said the
the idea of ​​a family planning awareness campaign left him
lukewarm.</p>
              <p>Islam already demands that births be spaced by 30 months,
more than the World Health Organization recommendation of 24
months, said Azize, who at 30 has two children and says he will
take as many as God provides.</p>
              <p>Seydou Boubacar, the former head of the Islamic Association
of Niger, offered a blunter rationale for opposing family
planning.</p>
              <p>""Non-profits, when speaking of family planning, encourage
youth to debauchery,"" he insisted.</p>
              <p>""As soon as they speak of spacing out births, all they do is
show rubbers, and that is not okay.""

NIAMEY, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Abdulaziz,
Aminatu, Absatu, Abdulmanaf. Fahad. And, well, also Mansour.
They are the names Zeinab Garba has in mind for any future
children she has.
But for now the mother of two has decided to set aside plans
for more offspring by using a contraceptive, to give a better
future to Rachid, her restless 3-year-old boy, and her newborn
son Bilyaminou, mostly a passionate sleeper for now.
""I'm proud to wear the (contraceptive) implant,"" said Garba,
20.
In a country with the world's highest birth rate per woman,
hers is an uncommon move and, to some, a controversial one.
But environmentalists and youth activists in Niger hope it
is one more families will embrace, to help reduce threats from
the destructive effects of a changing climate.
Climate change has meant Niger has seen a swift rise in
temperatures and less abundant water flows in rivers, in
addition to more intense droughts and floods, said Issa Lele, a
meteorologist with the United Nations Development Programme.
That is a growing threat to food and water supplies - and
the pressures heighten as the nation's population booms, with
each woman having on average 7.6 children, said Sani Ayouba, the
director of environmental group Young Volunteers for the
Environment.
""We're not saying to stop having children,"" Ayouba, who has
three offspring of his own, said at a September meeting with
local non-profit leaders, prompting a wave of laughter.
Instead, he said, his group advocates the use of
contraceptives to slow the rate of births - a relief to one
listener who said he was expecting his fifth child.
Around the world, a rising global population is increasing
pressure on the world's limited resources, with every additional
person in need of food, transport, energy and other resources
that drive climate change.
That pressure is worst in the richest countries, where each
additional person consumes far more resources than an added
child in a poorer country.
But very high birthrates in places like Niger also mean the
country's own limited resources must be shared among more people
- a particular problem as climate change disrupts farming and
herding, threatening food supplies.

EFFECTIVE - BUT CONTROVERSIAL
At the clinic where Garba was getting a contraceptive
implant on a September afternoon, in the district of Talladje in
Niamey, herds of cows made their way to pasture just outside.
She breathed deeply when a midwife poked two tiny holes in
her arm with a needle and slid in the small, elongated implant.
The five-minute procedure will give her three years without
a pregnancy, with a 99% effectiveness rate, the midwife said.
The pill is by far the most popular birth control method in
Niger, but at this clinic of the international charity Marie
Stopes it is an implant, placed under the skin, that most women
seek, said Adama Abdoulaye, a doctor who coordinates the clinic.
More women like Garba streamed in and out of the center's
waiting room, glancing at soap operas playing on the television.
Nigerien authorites back some aspects of family planning,
and have begun to allocate money toward the push, said Issoufou
Harou, director of family planning at Niger's Ministry of Public
Health.
But a national budget of 200 million FCFA ($340,000) for
purchasing contraceptives doesn't go far enough, said Salamatou
Traore, president of the Coalition of Stakeholders for the
Repositioning of Family Planning in Niger.
Even that budget - and Garba's tiny implant - raise big
questions in this highly devout Islamic society, however.
Some 99% of Nigerians are Muslim, census data shows, and
Islam does not advocate limiting the number of children in a
family if they are well cared for, said Sita Amadou of the
Islamic Association of Niger, the chief Islamic organisation in
the country.
That complicates the ambitious plans of environmental
activists who since last year have been working to spread family
planning as a buffer against the effects of climate change in
Niger.
The activists have met with parliamentarians and cabinet
ministers, as well as a range of community groups.
At a recent gathering, in a small, damp room in Niamey, a
dozen representatives listened, silently at first, to the pitch
about a novel way of fighting growing climate pressures.
""It's not just about investing in agriculture so that it is
organic or sustainable but also in contraceptive methods and
family planning everywhere,"" said Ayouba, who spoke alongside
Issa Garba, who heads the Nigerien Youth Network on Climate
Change.
But worries quickly arose from a handful of listeners.
Muslim authorities will not accept the proposal, one participant
commented.
Ayouba and Garba said current projections - which show the
population of Niger tripling by 2050, from 22 million people
today, according to U.N. estimates - are untenable.
By some estimates, Niamey, Niger's sleepy capital of 1
million, could become one of the 10 largest cities in Africa by
2100, with as many as 50 million residents as a result of
population growth and urbanisation, European scientists said in
the journal Earth's Future earlier this year.
The country's 2012-2020 Action Plan for Family Planning
commits to making contraceptives available to half of the
population by next year - though their availability is less than
20% for now, government data shows.
But Niger's population growth rate is not simply the result
of lack of access to contraception, said Abdou Batouati, a
researcher at the Institute for Research in Human Sciences at
Niamey's Abdou Moumouni University.
""Culturally, in Niger, women space out their births at a
rate of a child every two years,"" he said.
In the city's open markets, among bars of soap, stalls of
lemons and the calls of salesmen, some vendors sell boxes of
contraceptive pills, stacked in colorful towers atop trays
carried on the vendors' heads.
The Pharmacy du Point, in the affluent district of Plateau,
also sells them. On a table, the manager spreads out rectangular
peach, blue and orange boxes of the contraceptives, which sell
for anywhere from 300 to 3,060 FCFA ($0.50 to $5.10).
But some people think that the pill ""is a way to get people
into debauchery,"" said Adama Jonathna, a midwife at the clinic
that helped Garba with her contraceptive implant.

IN THE PLAN?
Niger is currently a national plan on how it will adapt to
climate threats, aiming to integrate those efforts into
government planning and budgeting.
In what would be a pioneering move, it may include a section
noting the links between boosting family planning and lessening
climate change impacts.
""I do not mind doing it, but before that I need to have the
approval of my officials"" to do so, said Gousmane Moussa, the
plan's liaison to national authorities.
He said U.N. guidelines that inform such adaptation plans do
not urge family planning be a part of them.
Should Niger make clear the link between reducing birthrates
and lowering climate risks, it might be the first such case in a
national plan, said Christian Ledwell, an adaptation plan
specialist at the International Institute for Sustainable
Development, a Canadian think tank.
But the idea ruffles plenty of feathers in the Sahelian
country.
While preparing for the afternoon prayer on the campus of
the Abdou Moumouni University, Laminou Adamou Abdoul Azize - a
member of the Association of Muslim Students of Niger - said the
the idea of ​​a family planning awareness campaign left him
lukewarm.
Islam already demands that births be spaced by 30 months,
more than the World Health Organization recommendation of 24
months, said Azize, who at 30 has two children and says he will
take as many as God provides.
Seydou Boubacar, the former head of the Islamic Association
of Niger, offered a blunter rationale for opposing family
planning.
""Non-profits, when speaking of family planning, encourage
youth to debauchery,"" he insisted.
""As soon as they speak of spacing out births, all they do is
show rubbers, and that is not okay.""

              <p>NORTH WYKE, ENGLAND, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - It
is an idyllic countryside scene - an embrace of rolling hills
dappled with Instagram-worthy bales of straw, as sheep and cows
graze under a bright blue sky. Completing the picture, a stately
manor graces the background.</p>
              <p>But this bucolic setting belies a research project that uses
cutting-edge technology on a real-life farm to test ways of
making agriculture more sustainable as rising temperatures and
greenhouse gas emissions threaten productivity.</p>
              <p>""We want to make an efficient (agricultural) system so that
we can consume as much of the nutrients we put in, and we lose
as little. That's the ultimate goal,"" said Taro Takahashi, a
research scientist at Rothamsted Research's ""Farm Lab"".</p>
              <p>To achieve that balance, scientists monitor nutrient levels
in everything from fertilisers, water and animal feed to meat,
manure and methane to try to understand how nutrients are gained
and lost in the farming process.</p>
              <p>The project was set up nearly a decade ago in North Wyke,
325 km (200 miles) west of London, and every square centimetre
of its 63 hectares (156 acres) is closely monitored.</p>
              <p>Cabins at the fields' edge house equipment to measure and
analyse each drop of water running off the land.</p>
              <p>Others measure emissions from the soil of planet-heating
greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide.</p>
              <p>The animals sport electronic tags in their ears, allowing
researchers to track their methane emissions, while a high-tech
sheep shed allows everything they eat - and dispose of - to be
recorded and measured.</p>
              <p>On-site laboratories analyse the information and quantify
soil health, the link between forage, growth and emissions, and
how much of the nutrients that enter the animals appears in the
resulting meat.</p>
              <p>""Each component is being measured by many research stations
around the world,"" said Takahashi. ""What is unique about us is
that we try to quantify all inputs into and outputs from farming
systems.""</p>
              <p>Doing all this on a real farm, instead of computer

NORTH WYKE, ENGLAND, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - It
is an idyllic countryside scene - an embrace of rolling hills
dappled with Instagram-worthy bales of straw, as sheep and cows
graze under a bright blue sky. Completing the picture, a stately
manor graces the background.
But this bucolic setting belies a research project that uses
cutting-edge technology on a real-life farm to test ways of
making agriculture more sustainable as rising temperatures and
greenhouse gas emissions threaten productivity.
""We want to make an efficient (agricultural) system so that
we can consume as much of the nutrients we put in, and we lose
as little. That's the ultimate goal,"" said Taro Takahashi, a
research scientist at Rothamsted Research's ""Farm Lab"".
To achieve that balance, scientists monitor nutrient levels
in everything from fertilisers, water and animal feed to meat,
manure and methane to try to understand how nutrients are gained
and lost in the farming process.
The project was set up nearly a decade ago in North Wyke,
325 km (200 miles) west of London, and every square centimetre
of its 63 hectares (156 acres) is closely monitored.
Cabins at the fields' edge house equipment to measure and
analyse each drop of water running off the land.
Others measure emissions from the soil of planet-heating
greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide.
The animals sport electronic tags in their ears, allowing
researchers to track their methane emissions, while a high-tech
sheep shed allows everything they eat - and dispose of - to be
recorded and measured.
On-site laboratories analyse the information and quantify
soil health, the link between forage, growth and emissions, and
how much of the nutrients that enter the animals appears in the
resulting meat.
""Each component is being measured by many research stations
around the world,"" said Takahashi. ""What is unique about us is
that we try to quantify all inputs into and outputs from farming
systems.""
Doing all this on a real farm, instead of computer
modelling, also lends nuance to an increasingly heated debate
over livestock farming and meat consumption, he said.
LESS MEAT, MILK
Livestock foments 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions,
nearly half of which comes from gases emitted by ruminants such
as cattle, sheep and goats from digestion and manure, according
to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
This has led to calls for developed nations to reduce meat
consumption. A July report from the U.S.-based World Resources
Institute (WRI) suggested the top beef and lamb consumers cut
their weekly intake to the equivalent of 1.5 burgers by 2050.
But Takahashi said the debate sometimes underplayed
livestock's important contributions, pointing to manure's
importance to soil fertility.
Timothy Searchinger, the WRI report's lead author and a
researcher at Princeton University, called Farm Lab's work
valuable, but emphasised the need to manage a projected 70%
spike in future demand for meat and milk.
""For the foreseeable future, more or less everyone who eats
a lot of meat and milk should try to eat less,"" he said.
""All solutions require both moderating demand and reducing
emissions and improving natural resource efficiency ... So kudos
to this kind of rigorous research.""
The debate is especially pointed in this corner of southwest
England, where for centuries the land has served as pasture,
partly due to conventional wisdom that it is hard to grow
cereals in the clay soil.
But that make-up provides for an ideal testing ground. The
soil, along with the gently sloping land, allows researchers to
capture all the water, and the nutrients carried in it, as it
passes through the fields.

CLEANER CATTLE, MORE LEGUMES
Information gleaned from the testing is helping scientists
at Rothamsted, the world's oldest agricultural research
institute whose North Wyke site spans nearly 400 hectares, to
develop more sustainable farming methods.
For example, data drawn from animal sensors showed some
cattle emitting up to 40% less methane than others. Identifying
and breeding those could be one simple way to cut emissions.
Growing legumes cut emissions by up to 20% at Farm Lab, due
to less need for synthetic fertilisers, which some say
contribute more than 10% of agricultural emissions.
Legumes also improve soil health, which the researchers say
plays a big role in improving the quality of grazing land.
""Because the pasture grows better, the animal grows better,""

              <p/>
              <p>MYANMAR/BANGLADESH: In 1982, Buddhist-majority Myanmar
passed a citizenship law that effectively rendered stateless
most Rohingya, who are Muslim and of South Asian descent.</p>
              <p>Ethnic violence has driven many to leave, but hundreds of
thousands remain in Myanmar. There are about 900,000 Rohingya in
neighbouring Bangladesh and smaller populations across Asia.</p>
              <p>Some are sold into slavery on fishing boats and plantations.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>IVORY COAST: Ivory Coast is home to 692,000 stateless
people. Many are descended from migrants from neighbouring
countries who were encouraged to work on Ivory Coast's coffee
and cotton plantations in the 20th century.</p>
              <p>At least a quarter of Ivory Coast's population is estimated
to be of foreign descent, and the question of who is or is not
Ivorian helped fuel two civil wars in the West African country.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>THAILAND: Nearly 479,000 people are stateless, including
members of ethnic hill tribes such as the Yao, Hmong and Karen
who live in the mountainous border with Myanmar and Laos, and
the semi-nomadic ""Sea Gypsies"" along the Andaman coast.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>ESTONIA/LATVIA: When the Soviet Union broke up, many ethnic
Russians remained in the new Baltic states and were defined as
""non-citizens"".</p>
              <p>Nearly 221,000 stateless people live in Latvia and 78,000 in
Estonia, mainly ethnic Russians who have trouble obtaining
citizenship and at times face discrimination.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>SYRIA: In 1962, many Kurds in the northeast were stripped of
citizenship, a move Human Rights Watch described as part of a
plan to ""Arabise"" the resource-rich region.</p>
              <p>Before the civil war, there were an estimated 300,000
stateless Kurds in Syria, many of whom were promised nationality
by President Bashar al-Assad in reaction to the 2011 uprising.</p>
              <p>U.N. data suggests the number fell to 160,000, but this may
be partly because many fled the war.</p>
              <p>Human rights experts have warned that babies born to Syrian
refugee women in Lebanon and Jordan could end up stateless.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>KUWAIT: Stateless people are known as Bidoon, which is short
for bidoon jinsiya meaning ""without nationality"" in Arabic. Some
trace their origins to nomadic tribes that once moved freely
around the Gulf region.</p>
              <p>There are about 92,000 Bidoon in Kuwait, according to U.N.
data, but some estimates are much higher. They are often barred
from free education, healthcare and many jobs.</p>

              <p>NEPAL: Although Nepal says it does not have a stateless
population, experts on statelessness believe many people,
possibly hundreds of thousands, may be affected.</p>
              <p>Part of the problem derives from a law banning women married
to foreigners from passing their nationality to their children.
There is also a stateless population of people who were expelled
by Bhutan in the 1990s.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: A 2013 court ruling, along with earlier
changes to nationality laws aimed at tackling illegal migration,
has left many stateless, mostly people of Haitian descent who
were born in Dominican Republic.</p>
              <p>In 2015, there were about 134,000 stateless people,
according to U.N. data, but the figures are being updated.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>IRAQ: There are about 47,500 stateless people who include
Bidoon and Faili Kurds, an ethnic group that historically live
both sides of the Iraq-Iran border.</p>
              <p>More than 100,000 Faili Kurds had their nationality revoked
in 1980 under the Ba'ath regime. Although many have since had
their nationality reinstated, others remain stateless.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>EUROPE: Tens of thousands of stateless Roma - an ethnic
group with origins in India - are thought to live in central,
eastern and southern Europe. With the break-up of Czechoslovakia
and Yugoslavia, successor states claimed they belonged
elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Other Roma in Kosovo and Bosnia have become stateless due to
war-time displacement.</p>
              <p>Roma are often unable to register their children's births or

              <p>LONDON, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Film star Cate
Blanchett will back a global campaign on Monday to end the
plight of an estimated 10 million people with no nationality
amid warnings rising xenophobia is stymieing efforts to meet a
2024 deadline for eradicating statelessness.</p>
              <p>The double Oscar-winner will speak at a major meeting in
Geneva aimed at persuading governments to dramatically escalate
progress in the campaign called #Ibelong.</p>
              <p>Blanchett's attendance will help boost attention on some of
the world's most invisible people.</p>
              <p>Not recognised as nationals of any country, stateless people
are often deprived of basic rights like education and
healthcare, and risk exploitation and detention.</p>
              <p>Blanchett will interview Maha Mamo, a formerly stateless
activist who has become a torchbearer for #Ibelong.
As a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR),
Blanchett recently visited Bangladesh to meet stateless Rohingya
who have fled Myanmar, and has met displaced Syrian families in
the Middle East.</p>
              <p>When U.N. chief Antonio Guterres launched the #Ibelong
initiative in 2014, during his time as head of the UNHCR, he
described statelessness as a ""cancer"" that must be excised.</p>
              <p>But the task ahead is monumental. Only about 200,000 people
acquired citizenship during the first half of the campaign,
barely making a dent in the overall number.</p>
              <p>And U.N. officials admit the total may now be even higher
than in 2014 because of increasing displacement triggered by
crises in Syria, Venezuela and elsewhere, which has raised the
risk of many children growing up stateless.</p>
              <p>There is also no solution in sight for many of the largest
groups of stateless people including the Rohingya, hundreds of
thousands of whom have fled to Bangladesh following an upsurge
in violence.</p>
              <p>Experts on statelessness spoke of ""storm clouds on the
horizon"" as forced displacement, xenophobia and populism
complicate efforts to meet the 2024 deadline.</p>
              <p>They are keeping a close eye on India, where 1.9 million
people in the northeastern state of Assam have been left off a
register of citizens, stoking concerns that many could become
stateless.</p>
              <p>DOGS HAVE MORE RIGHTS</p>
              <p>People end up stateless for a host of historical, social and
legal reasons including migration, flawed citizenship laws and
ethnic discrimination. Others fall through the cracks when
countries break up.</p>
              <p>Aside from Myanmar, there are big stateless groups in Ivory
Coast, Thailand, Nepal, Kuwait and some former Soviet countries.</p>
              <p>Stateless people have previously told the Thomson Reuters
Foundation that they feel stigmatised and forgotten.</p>
              <p>""We've had people telling us, 'dogs are more important than
I am',"" said Melanie Khanna, head of the UNHCR's statelessness
section.</p>
              <p>""People feel totally scarred and isolated. They often say,
'I thought it was just me'. It sends chills down your spine.""</p>
              <p>Despite slow progress on reducing numbers, Khanna said there
was far greater global awareness of statelessness than five
years ago.</p>
              <p>Almost all countries will be represented in Geneva, with
more than 20 sending ministers. U.N. officials expect
governments to make scores of pledges which will provide a
roadmap for accelerating the campaign.</p>
              <p>In July, Kyrgyzstan made history when it became the first
country to officially end statelessness. U.N. officials believe
Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan could also meet the
2024 deadline.</p>
              <p>Thailand, where nearly 479,000 people are stateless,
including members of ethnic hill tribes in the northern border
regions, is also stepping up action.</p>
              <p>The issue made international headlines last year during
rescue efforts to save a young Thai football team trapped in a
flooded cave.</p>
              <p>During the drama it emerged that several of the boys and
their coach were stateless. They were granted citizenship after
their ordeal.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>WIN-WIN</p>
              <p>But resolving statelessness is not just a human rights
issue. Statelessness has fuelled conflict and displacement in
both Myanmar and Ivory Coast.</p>
              <p>Khanna said there was a growing recognition that resolving
statelessness was a ""win-win"" because it was in governments'
interests to have everybody feel invested in the society they
live in and motivated to contribute.</p>
              <p>The U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of
global pledges on tackling poverty, inequality and other ills
with an overall ambition to ""to leave no one behind"", have
helped shift attitudes, Khanna said.</p>
              <p>""The SDGs have allowed us to talk about this whole area as a
development issue and not just a human rights one,"" she added.</p>
              <p>""This makes a lot of sense because you don't want
disenfranchised, impoverished people on your territory.""</p>
              <p>Khanna said an increasing number of countries were changing
their nationality laws and policies to prevent future
generations ending up in limbo.</p>
              <p>Colombia, for example, has announced it will give
citizenship to thousands of children born to Venezuelan migrants
to prevent them growing up stateless.</p>
              <p>Other countries have scrapped discriminatory laws that
prevent women passing their citizenship to their children - a
major cause of statelessness.</p>
              <p>The impact of such laws has been clearly seen during the
Syrian war with many displaced mothers unable to obtain
documents for their children where the father is dead or absent.</p>
              <p>Iran became the latest country to pass reforms last week - a
move human rights experts believe could help thousands of
children obtain citizenship.</p>
              <p>There has also been a flurry of countries joining the U.N.
conventions on preventing and eliminating statelessness.</p>
              <p>The 1961 convention stipulates that a state must grant
nationality to anyone born on its territory who would otherwise
be stateless - a safeguard that would wipe-out most new cases of
statelessness if adopted by all countries.</p>
              <p>""Statelessness causes devastating and totally unnecessary
damage,"" Khanna said.</p>
              <p>""But solutions aren't complicated. The biggest obstacle is
political will.""

LONDON, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Film star Cate
Blanchett will back a global campaign on Monday to end the
plight of an estimated 10 million people with no nationality
amid warnings rising xenophobia is stymieing efforts to meet a
2024 deadline for eradicating statelessness.
The double Oscar-winner will speak at a major meeting in
Geneva aimed at persuading governments to dramatically escalate
progress in the campaign called #Ibelong.
Blanchett's attendance will help boost attention on some of
the world's most invisible people.
Not recognised as nationals of any country, stateless people
are often deprived of basic rights like education and
healthcare, and risk exploitation and detention.
Blanchett will interview Maha Mamo, a formerly stateless
activist who has become a torchbearer for #Ibelong.
As a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR),
Blanchett recently visited Bangladesh to meet stateless Rohingya
who have fled Myanmar, and has met displaced Syrian families in
the Middle East.
When U.N. chief Antonio Guterres launched the #Ibelong
initiative in 2014, during his time as head of the UNHCR, he
described statelessness as a ""cancer"" that must be excised.
But the task ahead is monumental. Only about 200,000 people
acquired citizenship during the first half of the campaign,
barely making a dent in the overall number.
And U.N. officials admit the total may now be even higher
than in 2014 because of increasing displacement triggered by
crises in Syria, Venezuela and elsewhere, which has raised the
risk of many children growing up stateless.
There is also no solution in sight for many of the largest
groups of stateless people including the Rohingya, hundreds of
thousands of whom have fled to Bangladesh following an upsurge
in violence.
Experts on statelessness spoke of ""storm clouds on the
horizon"" as forced displacement, xenophobia and populism
complicate efforts to meet the 2024 deadline.
They are keeping a close eye on India, where 1.9 million
people in the northeastern state of Assam have been left off a
register of citizens, stoking concerns that many could become
stateless.
DOGS HAVE MORE RIGHTS
People end up stateless for a host of historical, social and
legal reasons including migration, flawed citizenship laws and
ethnic discrimination. Others fall through the cracks when
countries break up.
Aside from Myanmar, there are big stateless groups in Ivory
Coast, Thailand, Nepal, Kuwait and some former Soviet countries.
Stateless people have previously told the Thomson Reuters
Foundation that they feel stigmatised and forgotten.
""We've had people telling us, 'dogs are more important than
I am',"" said Melanie Khanna, head of the UNHCR's statelessness
section.
""People feel totally scarred and isolated. They often say,
'I thought it was just me'. It sends chills down your spine.""
Despite slow progress on reducing numbers, Khanna said there
was far greater global awareness of statelessness than five
years ago.
Almost all countries will be represented in Geneva, with
more than 20 sending ministers. U.N. officials expect
governments to make scores of pledges which will provide a
roadmap for accelerating the campaign.
In July, Kyrgyzstan made history when it became the first
country to officially end statelessness. U.N. officials believe
Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan could also meet the
2024 deadline.
Thailand, where nearly 479,000 people are stateless,
including members of ethnic hill tribes in the northern border
regions, is also stepping up action.
The issue made international headlines last year during
rescue efforts to save a young Thai football team trapped in a
flooded cave.
During the drama it emerged that several of the boys and
their coach were stateless. They were granted citizenship after
their ordeal.

WIN-WIN
But resolving statelessness is not just a human rights
issue. Statelessness has fuelled conflict and displacement in
both Myanmar and Ivory Coast.
Khanna said there was a growing recognition that resolving
statelessness was a ""win-win"" because it was in governments'
interests to have everybody feel invested in the society they
live in and motivated to contribute.
The U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of
global pledges on tackling poverty, inequality and other ills
with an overall ambition to ""to leave no one behind"", have
helped shift attitudes, Khanna said.
""The SDGs have allowed us to talk about this whole area as a
development issue and not just a human rights one,"" she added.
""This makes a lot of sense because you don't want
disenfranchised, impoverished people on your territory.""
Khanna said an increasing number of countries were changing
their nationality laws and policies to prevent future
generations ending up in limbo.
Colombia, for example, has announced it will give
citizenship to thousands of children born to Venezuelan migrants
to prevent them growing up stateless.
Other countries have scrapped discriminatory laws that
prevent women passing their citizenship to their children - a
major cause of statelessness.
The impact of such laws has been clearly seen during the
Syrian war with many displaced mothers unable to obtain
documents for their children where the father is dead or absent.
Iran became the latest country to pass reforms last week - a
move human rights experts believe could help thousands of
children obtain citizenship.
There has also been a flurry of countries joining the U.N.
conventions on preventing and eliminating statelessness.
The 1961 convention stipulates that a state must grant
nationality to anyone born on its territory who would otherwise
be stateless - a safeguard that would wipe-out most new cases of
statelessness if adopted by all countries.
""Statelessness causes devastating and totally unnecessary
damage,"" Khanna said.
""But solutions aren't complicated. The biggest obstacle is
political will.""

              <p>By Kagondu Njagi</p>
              <p>ILULA, Kenya, Oct 5 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Anyone
hearing the loud singing coming from Isaac Chereger's farm would
be forgiven for thinking it was a particularly enthusiastic
church gathering.</p>
              <p>Instead, it was a group of women calling to order a meeting
of a local religious charity that teaches villagers how to
conserve the forest around their homes in this southwestern
Kenya community, to help stop the Mara River from drying.
For more than a decade, environmental groups have raised the
alarm over the Mara River, warning that population growth,
illegal logging and overuse of its waters by communities
struggling through drought have caused a dramatic drop in the
river's water levels.</p>
              <p>At the meeting on Chereger's farm, some villagers
volunteered to plant saplings where their fields meet the river,
while others agreed to get training on why the unplanned felling
of trees along the river could worsen the impact of drought.</p>
              <p>Chereger told the Thomson Reuters Foundation he is proud of
the conservation work his community does, but has long wondered
if it was enough.</p>
              <p>That's why the Empowering Lives International Centre - which
put on the meeting on his farm - has joined other local
organisations in an effort to give their traditional
conservation work some technological muscle.</p>
              <p>The Stockholm Environment Institute, an international
research organisation, has created a software-based water
evaluation and planning (WEAP) tool designed to help government
agencies and project partners better manage water.</p>
              <p>When communities know what to expect from the Mara River's
changing water levels, they can more quickly adapt and find the
most effective ways to slow the drying of the river, the
institute's researchers say.</p>
              <p>The group in Ilula village say they are keen to add the
system to their conservation toolbelt.</p>
              <p>""The Mara River gives us pasture and water for our cattle.
If this innovation can help in preventing bad use of the river,
then we are ready to work with it,"" said Chereger.</p>
              <p>WADING GOATS</p>
              <p>There are currently no official figures on how much water
levels in the Mara River basin, home to about a million people,
have dropped over the past few decades.</p>
              <p>But Nkoinko Siposha, from Oloroito village in the upper
basin, recalled that in the 1990s it was impossible for his

ILULA, Kenya, Oct 5 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Anyone
hearing the loud singing coming from Isaac Chereger's farm would
be forgiven for thinking it was a particularly enthusiastic
church gathering.
Instead, it was a group of women calling to order a meeting
of a local religious charity that teaches villagers how to
conserve the forest around their homes in this southwestern
Kenya community, to help stop the Mara River from drying.
For more than a decade, environmental groups have raised the
alarm over the Mara River, warning that population growth,
illegal logging and overuse of its waters by communities
struggling through drought have caused a dramatic drop in the
river's water levels.
At the meeting on Chereger's farm, some villagers
volunteered to plant saplings where their fields meet the river,
while others agreed to get training on why the unplanned felling
of trees along the river could worsen the impact of drought.
Chereger told the Thomson Reuters Foundation he is proud of
the conservation work his community does, but has long wondered
if it was enough.
That's why the Empowering Lives International Centre - which
put on the meeting on his farm - has joined other local
organisations in an effort to give their traditional
conservation work some technological muscle.
The Stockholm Environment Institute, an international
research organisation, has created a software-based water
evaluation and planning (WEAP) tool designed to help government
agencies and project partners better manage water.
When communities know what to expect from the Mara River's
changing water levels, they can more quickly adapt and find the
most effective ways to slow the drying of the river, the
institute's researchers say.
The group in Ilula village say they are keen to add the
system to their conservation toolbelt.
""The Mara River gives us pasture and water for our cattle.
If this innovation can help in preventing bad use of the river,
then we are ready to work with it,"" said Chereger.
WADING GOATS
There are currently no official figures on how much water
levels in the Mara River basin, home to about a million people,
have dropped over the past few decades.
But Nkoinko Siposha, from Oloroito village in the upper
basin, recalled that in the 1990s it was impossible for his
cattle to wade through any part of the river because of its
depth.
These days, even goats walk leisurely through the drying
river to graze on the other side of its shores, the 65-year-old
herder told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Starting in the Mau forests, in southwestern Kenya, the Mara
River basin stretches over 13,750 square kilometres (5,300
square miles), through the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya
and Tanzania's Serengeti plains, before it spills into
Tanzania's Lake Victoria.
Tom Ogol, a former researcher at the Stockholm Environment
Institute, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation there are several
key threats to the river.
They include loss of forests along its shores and
unsustainable agricultural activity, such as farmers illegally
siphoning water from the river for irrigation.
Both are ""aggravating what climate change has already
altered"", with increasingly long droughts now a problem, Ogol
said.
In October last year, Rift Valley commissioner George
Natembeya said the growing number of flower farms cropping up
along the river are a problem, with some farmers using
petrol-powered pumps to suck water fromthe river.
Such pumps are restricted in the county due to the pollution
they cause.
According to Natembeya, water demand in the Mara River basin
is over 20 million cubic metres per year, with irrigated
agriculture accounting for about half of that.
""This demand is too much. The river cannot provide it all
because its water sources, which are in the basin, are drying up
due to climate change,"" Natembeya said during a press briefing.
He then delivered a dire prediction.
""The Mara River will be dead in three years,"" he warned.
