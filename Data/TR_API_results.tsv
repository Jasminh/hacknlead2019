              <p>TBILISI, Oct 31 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A critical
shortage of affordable housing in cities across the world has
forced many people to tap such unexpected resources as shipping
containers and concrete pipes just to put a roof over their
head.</p>
              <p>At least 150 million people, about 2% of the global
population, are homeless according to United Nations data while
more than 20% of the population lack adequate housing. Many live
in cities.</p>
              <p>As the U.N. marks World Cities Day on Thursday, here are
eight dwelling types which highlight how cities are coping with
housing crises:</p>
              <p/>
              <p>CAGE HOMES</p>
              <p>Hong Kong's property prices have rocketed over 200% in the
past decade driven by limited housing supply and large capital
flows from mainland Chinese buyers, forcing some of the city's
poorest to live in often squalid conditions.</p>
              <p>Tens of thousands are crammed into rooftop shanties,
so-called cage homes with plywood bunk beds, or into tiny
partitioned flats averaging just 62 sq ft (6 sq m).</p>
              <p/>
              <p>SLEEPING PODS</p>
              <p>As rising prices push city workers to live further from the
centre and endure long commutes, sleep pods which allow for a
power nap near the office have popped up from Madrid and London
to New York.</p>
              <p>In the British capital, start-up Pop &amp; Rest offers busy
travellers, flagging party-goers and restless new parents a bed
in a tiny dark room scented with lavender and outfitted with ear
plugs and eye masks for less than 20 pounds ($26) an hour.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>GARDEN HOMES</p>
              <p>As part of a project to help refugees find homes in France,
local non-profit Quatorze has installed tiny wooden houses
insulated with cardboard in some Paris backyards.</p>
              <p>The first was set up in a family's garden in the eastern
suburb of Montreuil in 2017, with an Afghan refugee as its
tenant. A second was installed at the back of an art gallery in
the same district earlier this year.</p>

TBILISI, Oct 31 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A critical
shortage of affordable housing in cities across the world has
forced many people to tap such unexpected resources as shipping
containers and concrete pipes just to put a roof over their
head.
At least 150 million people, about 2% of the global
population, are homeless according to United Nations data while
more than 20% of the population lack adequate housing. Many live
in cities.
As the U.N. marks World Cities Day on Thursday, here are
eight dwelling types which highlight how cities are coping with
housing crises:

CAGE HOMES
Hong Kong's property prices have rocketed over 200% in the
past decade driven by limited housing supply and large capital
flows from mainland Chinese buyers, forcing some of the city's
poorest to live in often squalid conditions.
Tens of thousands are crammed into rooftop shanties,
so-called cage homes with plywood bunk beds, or into tiny
partitioned flats averaging just 62 sq ft (6 sq m).

SLEEPING PODS
As rising prices push city workers to live further from the
centre and endure long commutes, sleep pods which allow for a
power nap near the office have popped up from Madrid and London
to New York.
In the British capital, start-up Pop & Rest offers busy
travellers, flagging party-goers and restless new parents a bed
in a tiny dark room scented with lavender and outfitted with ear
plugs and eye masks for less than 20 pounds ($26) an hour.

GARDEN HOMES
As part of a project to help refugees find homes in France,
local non-profit Quatorze has installed tiny wooden houses
insulated with cardboard in some Paris backyards.
The first was set up in a family's garden in the eastern
suburb of Montreuil in 2017, with an Afghan refugee as its
tenant. A second was installed at the back of an art gallery in
the same district earlier this year.

GRANNY FLATS
A growing number of homeowners in the U.S. capital of
Washington - among the country's most expensive cities - have
turned townhouse basements or garages into small living units
to rent out, often to help cover mortgage costs.
Known as granny flats, mother-in-law suites or English
basements, these conversions are gaining in popularity across
the U.S. as a way to boost affordable housing, according to
property experts.

LIVE-IN GUARDIANS
Up to 7,000 people are serving as guardians in empty
properties across Britain, mainly in London, according to a 2018
report by the London Assembly, an elected body that scrutinizes
the activities of the mayor.
Guardians pay low rents in exchange for securing buildings
from squatters and vandals, but sometimes live in poorly
maintained mouldy homes with few legal protections, the report
said.

SHIPPING CONTAINERS
Thousands of homeless children in Britain are being forced
to sleep in often overcrowded converted shipping containers that
are ""blisteringly hot"" in summer and ""freezing"" in winter, a
report by Children's Commissioner for England said in August.

EGG HOUSE
A Chinese man named Dai Haifei made international headlines
in 2010 when, unable to afford Beijing's high rental prices, he
lived for a few months in an homemade egg-shaped mobile house
near his office in the city.
The house was made of bamboo strips, steel bars, heat
prevention and waterproof materials, sacks filled with fermented
wood chips and grass seeds, as well as one solar panel, local
media reported.

WATER PIPES
To ease Hong Kong's housing crisis, a local architectural
firm created micro homes in concrete water pipes that can be
stacked under elevated roadways or between highrises.
Measuring 2.5 metres (8 feet) in diameter, the pipes have
been remade into 100 sq ft (9 sq m) apartments for two, with a
living and kitchen space, a shower and a toilet.

F ifteen minutes into their first date, Indonesian teenager Helma

He spirited her away to a relative's house and a month later, at
age 17, they were married.</p>
              <p>Yani is one of nearly 1.5 million child brides in

              <p>Known locally as ""merariq"", Sasak elders say the kidnapping

children and chickens roam the streets. ""We rode off on a

              <p>Indonesia's Women Empowerment and Child Protection Ministry
said in a recent statement that it planned to raise awareness
through education among children, parents and religious leaders
to end child marriage.</p>
              <p>It did not reply to a request for comment.</p>
              <p>The government has stated that raising the age of marriage
would save children from underage unions.</p>
              <p>The change came after Indonesia's top court last year ruled
in favour of a petition by women's rights groups who argued the
rule discriminated against girls, who could marry at 16 while
the legal age for men is 19.</p>
              <p>But the new law permits exceptions if parents ask the court
for permission, raising concerns that young women could still be
forced to marry in large numbers.</p>
              <p>WEAVING AND BUFFALO</p>
              <p>Wearing a traditional Muslim ""songkok"" prayer cap and a
batik shirt, Sasak elder Muhamad Rais is among senior figures
who advise local people on traditional customs in matters like
birth, marriage and death.</p>
              <p>Since 2016 he has worked with local charities under a pilot
project to revive the original ""merariq"" traditions, which he
said are governed by a set of complicated steps that must be
carefully followed before the ""kidnapping ritual"" takes place.</p>
              <p>""I am sad, embarrassed and angry,"" Rais told the Thomson
Reuters Foundation in a bamboo hut where he regularly dispenses
advice to villagers.</p>
              <p>""Our tradition has been abused by our own people. The
victims are our girls and women,"" said Rais, 54.</p>
              <p>Key to his work is re-introducing an element known as
""belas"" to the rituals, which allows the girl and boy to be
separated if they are deemed not yet fit for marriage.</p>
              <p>And while traditional ""merariq"" customs do not stipulate a
minimum age, Rais said the woman must have weaved 144 pieces of
cloth and the man must have reared buffalo which have produced
25 offspring before they can wed.</p>
              <p>In other words, they must be adults.</p>
              <p>The pilot project, in place in four villages since 2016, has
stopped some 20 underage unions according to Lombok-based
charity Child and Youth Protection Institution, which is

from its original practice that led to all these issues,"" said
spokeswoman Baiq Zulhiatina.</p>

people and tell them stopping child marriage is not shameful.""</p>

Indonesia's Women Empowerment and Child Protection Ministry
said in a recent statement that it planned to raise awareness
through education among children, parents and religious leaders
to end child marriage.
It did not reply to a request for comment.
The government has stated that raising the age of marriage
would save children from underage unions.
The change came after Indonesia's top court last year ruled
in favour of a petition by women's rights groups who argued the
rule discriminated against girls, who could marry at 16 while
the legal age for men is 19.
But the new law permits exceptions if parents ask the court
for permission, raising concerns that young women could still be
forced to marry in large numbers.
WEAVING AND BUFFALO
Wearing a traditional Muslim ""songkok"" prayer cap and a
batik shirt, Sasak elder Muhamad Rais is among senior figures
who advise local people on traditional customs in matters like
birth, marriage and death.
Since 2016 he has worked with local charities under a pilot
project to revive the original ""merariq"" traditions, which he
said are governed by a set of complicated steps that must be
carefully followed before the ""kidnapping ritual"" takes place.
""I am sad, embarrassed and angry,"" Rais told the Thomson
Reuters Foundation in a bamboo hut where he regularly dispenses
advice to villagers.
""Our tradition has been abused by our own people. The
victims are our girls and women,"" said Rais, 54.
Key to his work is re-introducing an element known as
""belas"" to the rituals, which allows the girl and boy to be
separated if they are deemed not yet fit for marriage.
And while traditional ""merariq"" customs do not stipulate a
minimum age, Rais said the woman must have weaved 144 pieces of
cloth and the man must have reared buffalo which have produced
25 offspring before they can wed.
In other words, they must be adults.
The pilot project, in place in four villages since 2016, has
stopped some 20 underage unions according to Lombok-based
charity Child and Youth Protection Institution, which is
spearheading the initiative.
""We can't blame the tradition, because it's the deviation
from its original practice that led to all these issues,"" said
spokeswoman Baiq Zulhiatina.
""What we are trying to do is to change the mindset of our
people and tell them stopping child marriage is not shameful.""

              <p>MUMBAI, Oct 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Facebook is
failing to rein in a ""tsunami"" of hate posts inflaming ethnic
tensions in India's Assam state, campaign group Avaaz said on
Wednesday, with content about ""criminals"", ""rapists"",
""terrorists"" and ""dogs"" shared almost 100,000 times.</p>
              <p>Avaaz said the dehumanising language - often targeting
India's Bengali Muslims - was similar to that used on Facebook
about Myanmar's Rohingya before an army crackdown and ethnic
violence forced 700,000 Rohingya to flee in 2017 to Bangladesh.</p>
              <p>A Facebook spokesman said the company was proactively
removing 65% of hate speech before it was reported globally, and
that its content reviewers, working in at least nine Indian
languages, were rigorously trained to ""catch harmful content"".</p>
              <p>The United Nations warned of rising hate speech on social
media in India's northeastern Assam state as the government
prepared to publish a list of Indian citizens in the state that
left out nearly 2 million people, many Bengali Muslims.</p>
              <p>""Facebook is being used as a megaphone for hate, pointed
directly at vulnerable minorities in Assam, many of whom could
be made stateless within months,"" Alaphia Zoyab, a campaigner at
Avaaz, said in a statement.</p>
              <p>To be included on the register, published in August,
residents had to prove their families lived in India before
March 24, 1971, when hundreds of thousands of people began
fleeing conflict across the border in what is now Bangladesh.</p>
              <p>Resentment against illegal immigrants has simmered for years
in Assam, one of India's poorest states, with residents blaming
outsiders, mainly Bangladeshis, for taking their jobs and land.</p>
              <p>Avaaz, which campaigns against disinformation on social
media, analysed 800 Facebook posts and comments relating to
Assam and the register, and found that about 27% constituted
hate speech, which it estimated had been viewed 5 million times.</p>
              <p>It flagged 213 posts to Facebook, which removed 96 of them,
including one by an elected official implying that those who
rape ""our mothers and sisters"" are ""Bangladeshi Muslims"", and
calls to ""poison"" daughters and legalise female foeticide.</p>
              <p>Facebook has been criticised for not acting to stamp out
hate speech on its platform in Myanmar and for not stopping the
use of fake accounts aiming to sway public opinion in the 2016

run by the Stasi secret police.</p>
              <p>A West German responsible for his chemical company's
business in the East, Schulze was on his way to a trade fair in
the East German city of Leipzig in 1986 when he stopped at a
motorway service station and met a woman by chance.</p>
              <p>Schulze, now 66, was fascinated by the well-dressed woman
and they began a relationship. The East-West dimension of their

              <p>""I didn't know that she was an unofficial Stasi informant,""
said Schulze, who gives tours of Hohenschoenhausen prison, where
he spent some of his 13 months behind bars three decades ago, in
eastern Berlin.</p>
              <p>""It was only later, when the accusation of spying was
raised, that everything appeared in a different light.""</p>
              <p>Such themes of temptation, duplicity and betrayal that
marked Cold War-era espionage have come back into focus in the

              <p/>
              <p>""ROMEO SPIES""</p>
              <p>Schulze found out some time after he became romantically

separated - worked for the Stasi, but he did not grasp the full
extent until the media reported on her Stasi files in 2009.</p>
              <p>Under its foreign intelligence chief Markus Wolf, the Stasi
perfected the use of ""Romeo spies"" - agents who used their
personal charms as well as their wiles to ensnare Western
sources of valuable intelligence.</p>
              <p>Unbeknown to Schulze, his lover had been tasked by the Stasi
with picking up solo travellers and business people from the
West. She told him she wanted to flee to the West and Schulze
still isn't sure whether that was her personal desire or whether

              <p>Three years before the fall of the Wall, Schulze was

              <p>East German authorities ultimately withdrew accusations of

crimes and helping prepare an illegal border crossing.</p>
              <p>""I can tell you it really hits you hard. You have to absorb

              <p>By Emma Batha</p>
              <p>LONDON, Oct 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The deaths of
39 migrants found in a refrigerated truck in Britain has
reignited calls for efforts to tackle slavery in the nail bar
sector, a common destination for trafficked Vietnamese.</p>
              <p>Most of the people discovered in the truck are believed to
be from Vietnam, one of the top source countries for victims of
modern slavery in Britain - accounting for about 10% of 7,000
suspected slaves referred to the government for support in 2018.</p>
              <p>Police are still investigating the case and it is not yet
clear why the victims were travelling to Britain.</p>
              <p>But it is well documented that some Vietnamese - lured to
Europe by promises of lucrative jobs - end up exploited in
illegal cannabis farms and cheap nail bars which have
proliferated across the country.</p>
              <p>""It's an extreme tragedy and I think hopefully it will be a
catalyst for some sort of change,"" said Philippa Southwell, a
lawyer with Birds Solicitors who specialises in trafficking.</p>
              <p>""(We need) tighter regulation in various sectors such as
cash-in-hand nail bars and car washes where it is easy for
exploitation to take place,"" she said, adding that nail salons
were often used to launder proceeds from criminal activity.</p>
              <p>Although many nail bars set up by Britain's Vietnamese
community are legitimate, experts say traffickers have
piggy-backed off their success.</p>
              <p>Anti-slavery charity Unseen said labour exploitation at
beauty salons was the second biggest concern after carwashes for
callers to its hotline last year, with 477 potential victims.</p>
              <p>Britain's anti-slavery chief said on Tuesday that most
recommendations made by her office in 2017 on tackling the issue
- including regulation of nail bars - had not been implemented.</p>

LONDON, Oct 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The deaths of
39 migrants found in a refrigerated truck in Britain has
reignited calls for efforts to tackle slavery in the nail bar
sector, a common destination for trafficked Vietnamese.
Most of the people discovered in the truck are believed to
be from Vietnam, one of the top source countries for victims of
modern slavery in Britain - accounting for about 10% of 7,000
suspected slaves referred to the government for support in 2018.
Police are still investigating the case and it is not yet
clear why the victims were travelling to Britain.
But it is well documented that some Vietnamese - lured to
Europe by promises of lucrative jobs - end up exploited in
illegal cannabis farms and cheap nail bars which have
proliferated across the country.
""It's an extreme tragedy and I think hopefully it will be a
catalyst for some sort of change,"" said Philippa Southwell, a
lawyer with Birds Solicitors who specialises in trafficking.
""(We need) tighter regulation in various sectors such as
cash-in-hand nail bars and car washes where it is easy for
exploitation to take place,"" she said, adding that nail salons
were often used to launder proceeds from criminal activity.
Although many nail bars set up by Britain's Vietnamese
community are legitimate, experts say traffickers have
piggy-backed off their success.
Anti-slavery charity Unseen said labour exploitation at
beauty salons was the second biggest concern after carwashes for
callers to its hotline last year, with 477 potential victims.
Britain's anti-slavery chief said on Tuesday that most
recommendations made by her office in 2017 on tackling the issue
- including regulation of nail bars - had not been implemented.
Trafficking experts said the deaths, which were discovered
on Oct. 23, should be a ""clarion call"" for stronger action to
protect trafficking victims and called for tighter controls
including more labour inspections.
Northern Irish truck driver Maurice Robinson appeared in
court on Monday accused of manslaughter, money laundering,
conspiracy to traffic people and conspiracy to assist unlawful
immigration.

LOCKED UP
In 2017, Britain's former anti-slavery commissioner Kevin
Hyland called for tighter regulation of nail bars in a report on
combating trafficking involving Vietnamese nationals.
One victim quoted in his report worked seven days a week for
30 pounds ($40). Another had to give all his money to his
enslavers who locked him up between shifts.
Hyland said Britain should look at New York which had

              <p>BOBIYA, India, Oct 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When
half a dozen trucks loaded with construction material screeched
to a halt on their farms, Baryam Singh and fellow residents in
the Indian village of Bobiya sensed they were soon going to lose
more land to the military.</p>
              <p>The farmers chased away the contractors and labourers with
protests and threats of deflated tyres, knowing it was only a
temporary reprieve.</p>
              <p>""The military infrastructure has been growing in our village
and our farmlands are shrinking,"" Singh told the Thomson Reuters
Foundation, as other farmers sitting around him nodded.</p>
              <p>""More than 50% of our agricultural land is under military
lockdown,"" he said of the village on the border with Pakistan.</p>
              <p>Over the past 15 years, the Indian army and the country's
Border Security Force (BSF) have been acquiring land to fortify
defences in the border districts of Jammu and Kashmir, according
to the Border Welfare Committee, a local organisation
campaigning for the rights of border residents.</p>
              <p>Both India and Pakistan administer the disputed state of
Kashmir in part while claiming it in full.</p>
              <p>The fertile land where Jammu and Kashmir meets Pakistan has
become dotted with barbed wire and landmines, leaving hundreds
of farmers cut off from their farms, often with no warning or
compensation, said Bobiya villagers.</p>
              <p>""This is adding to the economic distress of farmers who
don't have alternative sources of livelihood,"" said Singh.</p>
              <p>After India revoked the autonomy of its portion of Kashmir
in August, farmers in border areas now fear losing even more of
their land to the military, according to ID Khajuria, an
activist who heads up the Jammu and Kashmir Forum for Peace and
Territorial Integrity.</p>
              <p>With India bringing Jammu and Kashmir deeper into its fold,
the central government will have greater power to seize
territory in the border regions in the name of national
security, he warned.</p>
              <p>""The local elected political representatives will now have a
very limited say in the functioning of the (Jammu and Kashmir)
government,"" Khajuria said.</p>
              <p>Jammu divisional commissioner Sanjeev Verma said that all
farmers in Jammu province would eventually be paid for their
land.</p>
              <p>""Whatever new agricultural land is being acquired, the
farmers will get financial compensation,"" he said in a phone
interview.</p>
              <p>Some have already been compensated, he added, though he
declined to specify how many.</p>
              <p>'I AM LANDLESS NOW'</p>
              <p>The defence system includes a fence of about 900 km (560
miles) in length that sits several kilometres into India from
the border, slicing through villages and leaving vast tracts of
farmland on the other side of the fence towards Pakistan.</p>
              <p>India's government is also working on a ""Wall of Defence""
along the border between India and Pakistan, according to the
Border Security Force.</p>
              <p>The project consists of a 10-metre-high (32-foot) mud
embankment to protect residents of India's border villages from
frequent ceasefire violations that both sides blame on each
other.</p>
              <p>There are also plans to install high-tech surveillance
systems to plug gaps where physical surveillance is not
possible, India's ministry of home affairs announced last year.</p>
              <p>Members of the Border Welfare Committee - which is based in
the city of K    athua - said that thousands of hectares of
Indian farmland now sit untouched on the other side of the
fence.</p>
              <p>Technically, farmers can still get to their land, but the
checkpoints in the fence are opened only during specific times
of day and farmers have to walk for hours to reach their fields,
explained Bharat Bhushan Sharma, the committee's vice president.</p>
              <p>Even if they do manage to successfully cultivate their
crops, ""there is always a threat of cross-border fire"", said
Sharma, who is also head of Bobiya village.</p>
              <p>""And then (they) can't protect their crops from wild
animals.""</p>
              <p>Committee president Nanak Chand, 87, said he lost almost
eight hectares of land to the fence when it was first built in
2004.</p>
              <p>""Three months ago, the military acquired the remaining two
hectares of farmland as well,"" he said. ""I am landless now.""</p>
              <p>Chand was given 3 million rupees ($42,000) as compensation,
which he says is not enough to buy himself an equivalent piece
of land in a peaceful part of the country.</p>
              <p>Khajuria agreed, saying that ""with developers and
businessmen from other states rushing to Jammu and Kashmir, land
prices are likely to soar and it would make it difficult for
poor border residents to buy land in peaceful areas.""</p>
              <p>In December 2018, Chand filed a petition with the Jammu and
Kashmir High Court on behalf of farmers living in the border
areas of the affected districts.</p>
              <p>The petition called for the government to pay rent for
farmland on the Pakistan side of the fence and provide farmers
with compensation for each crop season during which their land
remains uncultivated.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Home Affairs, the BSF and the local
administration have not yet filed their responses, according to
lawyers representing the farmers.</p>
              <p>Jugal Kishore Sharma, a member of the ruling Bharatiya
Janata Party who represents the Jammu-Poonch parliamentary
constituency, could not specify how much of the land along the
border currently being used by the military is farmland.</p>
              <p>But he said officials in the border districts are in the
process of measuring that amount.</p>
              <p>""Thereafter, the government will start paying rent to
farmers,"" he said in a phone interview.</p>
              <p>WAITING FOR PEACE</p>
              <p>Often times, when the border fence cuts through a farm, it
also isolates the village in which the farm is located, said
Mohammad Arif Khan, 67, head of Behrooti village in Poonch
district.</p>
              <p>As a result, ""the villages (are) deprived of even the basic
facilities and infrastructure,"" he explained.</p>
              <p>The huge razor-wire fence has turned Behrooti into what
locals have described as an open prison.</p>
              <p>""Our village doesn't have roads and healthcare facilities.
There is no internet or mobile phone connectivity,"" said
Mohammad Nisar Khan, 30, another resident.</p>
              <p>""A zoo is visited by people every day, but here the
outsiders are not allowed. Socially, we are completely
isolated.""</p>
              <p>The knowledge that the military plans to add high-tech
surveillance equipment to the fence is disheartening, said Khan,
who like many Indians living on the border is holding out hope
that the fence will one day be moved onto the border itself.</p>
              <p>""We'll become permanent prisoners if the fence gets upgraded
at its current location,"" he said.</p>
              <p>While the residents of Behrooti feel trapped in their
village by the fence, others fear it will force them to leave
their homes for good.</p>
              <p>""There's little chance that our next generation will be in a
position to continue living here (at the border),"" said Meer
Chand, a rice farmer in Nanga village, 30 kilometres (18 miles)
from Bobiya.</p>
              <p>""We've lost hope that there will ever be peace between India
and Pakistan. We have neither security of life nor livelihood.""

very limited say in the functioning of the (Jammu and Kashmir)
government,"" Khajuria said.
Jammu divisional commissioner Sanjeev Verma said that all
farmers in Jammu province would eventually be paid for their
land.
""Whatever new agricultural land is being acquired, the
farmers will get financial compensation,"" he said in a phone
interview.
Some have already been compensated, he added, though he
declined to specify how many.
'I AM LANDLESS NOW'
The defence system includes a fence of about 900 km (560
miles) in length that sits several kilometres into India from
the border, slicing through villages and leaving vast tracts of
farmland on the other side of the fence towards Pakistan.
India's government is also working on a ""Wall of Defence""
along the border between India and Pakistan, according to the
Border Security Force.
The project consists of a 10-metre-high (32-foot) mud
embankment to protect residents of India's border villages from
frequent ceasefire violations that both sides blame on each
other.
There are also plans to install high-tech surveillance
systems to plug gaps where physical surveillance is not
possible, India's ministry of home affairs announced last year.
Members of the Border Welfare Committee - which is based in
the city of K    athua - said that thousands of hectares of
Indian farmland now sit untouched on the other side of the
fence.
Technically, farmers can still get to their land, but the
checkpoints in the fence are opened only during specific times
of day and farmers have to walk for hours to reach their fields,
explained Bharat Bhushan Sharma, the committee's vice president.
Even if they do manage to successfully cultivate their
crops, ""there is always a threat of cross-border fire"", said
Sharma, who is also head of Bobiya village.
""And then (they) can't protect their crops from wild
animals.""
Committee president Nanak Chand, 87, said he lost almost
eight hectares of land to the fence when it was first built in
2004.
""Three months ago, the military acquired the remaining two
hectares of farmland as well,"" he said. ""I am landless now.""
Chand was given 3 million rupees ($42,000) as compensation,
which he says is not enough to buy himself an equivalent piece
of land in a peaceful part of the country.
Khajuria agreed, saying that ""with developers and
businessmen from other states rushing to Jammu and Kashmir, land
prices are likely to soar and it would make it difficult for
poor border residents to buy land in peaceful areas.""
In December 2018, Chand filed a petition with the Jammu and
Kashmir High Court on behalf of farmers living in the border
areas of the affected districts.
The petition called for the government to pay rent for
farmland on the Pakistan side of the fence and provide farmers
with compensation for each crop season during which their land
remains uncultivated.
The Ministry of Home Affairs, the BSF and the local
administration have not yet filed their responses, according to
lawyers representing the farmers.
Jugal Kishore Sharma, a member of the ruling Bharatiya
Janata Party who represents the Jammu-Poonch parliamentary
constituency, could not specify how much of the land along the
border currently being used by the military is farmland.
But he said officials in the border districts are in the
process of measuring that amount.
""Thereafter, the government will start paying rent to
farmers,"" he said in a phone interview.
WAITING FOR PEACE
Often times, when the border fence cuts through a farm, it
also isolates the village in which the farm is located, said
Mohammad Arif Khan, 67, head of Behrooti village in Poonch
district.
As a result, ""the villages (are) deprived of even the basic
facilities and infrastructure,"" he explained.
The huge razor-wire fence has turned Behrooti into what
locals have described as an open prison.
""Our village doesn't have roads and healthcare facilities.
There is no internet or mobile phone connectivity,"" said
Mohammad Nisar Khan, 30, another resident.
""A zoo is visited by people every day, but here the
outsiders are not allowed. Socially, we are completely
isolated.""
The knowledge that the military plans to add high-tech
surveillance equipment to the fence is disheartening, said Khan,
who like many Indians living on the border is holding out hope
that the fence will one day be moved onto the border itself.
""We'll become permanent prisoners if the fence gets upgraded
at its current location,"" he said.
While the residents of Behrooti feel trapped in their
village by the fence, others fear it will force them to leave
their homes for good.
""There's little chance that our next generation will be in a
position to continue living here (at the border),"" said Meer
Chand, a rice farmer in Nanga village, 30 kilometres (18 miles)
from Bobiya.
""We've lost hope that there will ever be peace between India
and Pakistan. We have neither security of life nor livelihood.""

Sophie Will</p>
              <p>LONDON, Oct 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The discovery
of 39 bodies in a truck in London last week cast a spotlight on
the global trade in human beings and sparked debate about
Britain's approach to tackling smugglers and traffickers.</p>
              <p>A British court heard on Monday that a global crime ring had
been involved in smuggling the dead - many of whom appear to
have come from Vietnam - as the driver of the truck faced
charges of manslaughter and human trafficking.</p>
              <p>Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on Saturday told
authorities to establish whether Vietnamese citizens were among
the dead, and to probe allegations of trafficking.</p>
              <p>Unlike trafficking, which is control over a person for the
purpose of exploitation, smuggling is merely illegal entry into
another country - although the latter can turn into the former.</p>
              <p>About 10% of the suspected 7,000 slavery victims found in

LONDON, Oct 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The discovery
of 39 bodies in a truck in London last week cast a spotlight on
the global trade in human beings and sparked debate about
Britain's approach to tackling smugglers and traffickers.
A British court heard on Monday that a global crime ring had
been involved in smuggling the dead - many of whom appear to
have come from Vietnam - as the driver of the truck faced
charges of manslaughter and human trafficking.
Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on Saturday told
authorities to establish whether Vietnamese citizens were among
the dead, and to probe allegations of trafficking.
Unlike trafficking, which is control over a person for the
purpose of exploitation, smuggling is merely illegal entry into
another country - although the latter can turn into the former.
About 10% of the suspected 7,000 slavery victims found in
Britain last year were Vietnamese. Most are trafficked for
labour such as cannabis cultivation and work in nail salons.
Globally, more than 40 million people are estimated by the
United Nations to be trapped in modern slavery as poverty,
conflict and climate change fuel the $150-billion-a-year trade.
The Thomson Reuters Foundation asked six anti-slavery
experts about how to prevent such deaths from happening again.

and workplaces, saying a failure to do so may be
unconstitutional.</p>
              <p>The court said the government's failure to ensure proper

              <p>""If you can allocate spaces for smoking, why can't you have
rooms for breastfeeding. It won't cost much,"" said lawyer Ishrat
Hassan, who filed the petition that led to the court's ruling.</p>
              <p>Kamrun Nahar, a senior women's ministry official, said it
was already government policy to create breastfeeding rooms,
which already existed in several of places.</p>
              <p>But the court said they should be in private shopping malls,
airports, bus stands and railway stations, also calling for
childcare provision in work places.</p>
              <p>Hassan said she realised the need for such spaces when her
own baby started crying when she was at an airport.</p>
              <p>""There was nowhere I could go to. I felt helpless. In the

              <p>Only about one in four Bangladeshi women of working age is

giving it four weeks to respond.
""If you can allocate spaces for smoking, why can't you have
rooms for breastfeeding. It won't cost much,"" said lawyer Ishrat
Hassan, who filed the petition that led to the court's ruling.
Kamrun Nahar, a senior women's ministry official, said it
was already government policy to create breastfeeding rooms,
which already existed in several of places.
But the court said they should be in private shopping malls,
airports, bus stands and railway stations, also calling for
childcare provision in work places.
Hassan said she realised the need for such spaces when her
own baby started crying when she was at an airport.
""There was nowhere I could go to. I felt helpless. In the
end, I requested the security to let me use the enclosure where
they screen female passenger to feed my child,"" she told the
Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Mothers@Work, a United Nations-backed initiative to support
maternity rights and promote breastfeeding in Bangladesh's
garment industry, has said companies face high levels of dropout
and absenteeism among new mothers on the workforce.
Only about one in four Bangladeshi women of working age is
employed - a higher proportion than in neighbouring India,
thanks largely to the large numbers working in garment
factories, but lower than China, Indonesia and the Philippines.
""In terms of living in a safe or friendly environment for
women, we are definitely behind,"" said Maleka Banu, general
secretary of the Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, a women's rights
group.
The court did not say what its next steps would be. But it
has the power to direct the government to act - and Hassan said
she was confident it would do so.

CHELMSFORD, England, Oct 28 (Reuters) - A court heard on
Monday that a global ring had been involved in smuggling the 39
people whose bodies were found in a truck near London, as the
driver faced charges of manslaughter and people-trafficking.
The discovery of the bodies last week in a refrigerated
truck on an industrial estate near London has shone a spotlight
on the illicit trade that sends the poor of Asia, Africa and the
Middle East on perilous journeys to the West.
The truck's driver, Maurice Robinson, appeared in Chelmsford
Magistrates' Court via video link. The 25-year-old, wearing a
grey sweatshirt, spoke only to confirm his name, address and
British nationality.
Robinson faces 43 charges in all - 39 counts of manslaughter
as well as accusations of conspiracy to traffic people,
conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration, and money laundering.
""This involves a global ring facilitating the movement of a
large number of immigrants into the UK,"" prosecution lawyer
Ogheneruona Mercy Iguyovwe told the court. She said other
suspects were still being sought.
Robinson did not apply for bail. He was remanded in custody
until Nov. 25, when the case will continue at the Old Bailey,
London's Central Criminal Court, and he will enter a plea.
He was arrested shortly after the bodies were found near the
English port of Purfleet. The shipping container they were in
had travelled from Zeebrugge in Belgium.

'HOPING FOR A BETTER LIFE'
""The whole nation and indeed the world has been shocked by
this tragedy, and the cruelty of the fate that has been suffered
by innocent people who were hoping for a better life in this
country,"" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wrote in a book
of condolences.
Interior minister Priti Patel told parliament the
investigation would unravel ""criminality that could stretch half
way across the world"".
Many of the dead appear to have come from Vietnam's northern
rice-growing areas of Nghe An and Ha Tinh, two of its poorest
provinces.
""If I could travel back in time, I wouldn't have let him go
this way,"" said Hoang Thi Ai, mother of Hoang Van Tiep, 18, who
is feared to be among the dead. ""I clean his room every day with
the hope that he wasn't in that deadly truck.""
Police have said few of the victims were carrying official
identification, and that they are resorting to fingerprints,
dental records, DNA and photographs from friends and relatives.
Vietnam said Britain had sent dossiers seeking help in
identifying four of the bodies.
Deputy Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son said Vietnam was still
unable to confirm the nationality of any of the victims.

'MY CHILD WAS SCAMMED'
Bui Thi Nhung, 19, is believed by her family to be one of
the dead.
They said she had left Nghe An in August, making her way
from China to Germany, then Belgium, where they believe she
entered the container.
About 70 percent of Vietnamese trafficking cases in Britain
between 2009 and 2016 were for labour exploitation, including
cannabis production and work in nail salons, Britain said last
year.
A report last March by the Pacific Links Foundation, a
U.S.-based anti-trafficking organisation, identified Nghe An as
home to many victims of human trafficking who end up in Europe.
The other province, Ha Tinh, was ravaged in 2016 by one of
Vietnam's worst environmental disasters when a steel mill owned
by Taiwan's Formosa Plastics contaminated coastal waters,
devastating fishing and tourism.
Tiep's mother said she believed her son had been tricked
into travelling to Britain, since he had made it to France when
he was 16 and settled down.
""One day he hastily asked us to raise 100 million dong
($4,300) for his trip,"" Ai said, sitting with family members in
their house in Dien Chau district of Nghe An province.
""My child was scammed. The guy who helped him organise the
journey to the UK said the 'VIP' service was very safe,
commuting in four-seat car - not that container.""

SECURITY QUESTIONS

originally launched in 2018, with a pilot phase that handed out
250 cards to fishermen on Kiwayu Island in Lamu County.
Those cards were eventually canceled due to the discovery of

              <p>The bodies were found on Wednesday in a truck container in Grays, about 32 km (20 miles) east of central London and British police are still trying to establish the identity of victims who in many cases lacked identity documents.</p>
              <p>In a poor rice-growing area of northern Vietnam, communities have been plunged into mourning with their hope all but lost for relatives who had set out to seek better lives in Europe and were thought to have been aboard the truck.</p>
              <p>The hashtag #RIP39 was trending in Vietnam on widely-used Facebook.</p>
              <p>Distraught, Nguyen Dinh Gia said he feared there was very little chance he would ever again see his 20-year-old son, Nguyen Dinh Luong, who had been trying to get to Britain after first making it to France.</p>
              <p>""Police from the Ministry of Public Security came to get DNA samples, our hair and blood,"" Nguyen Dinh Gia told Reuters at Can Loc in Ha Tinh province, where sympathizers gathered at the simple house amid lush rice fields to console the family.</p>
              <p>""I advised him not to go because I told him that even though our family had always had nothing and our children were always in hardship, but we brought them up just fine,"" Nguyen said.</p>
              <p>The father of Pham Thi Tra My, who sent a last text message to her family in the early hours of Wednesday Vietnam time, said police had also been to collect samples of blood and hair.</p>
              <p>Vietnam's government did not respond immediately for a request for comment. Vietnam's prime minister has called for an investigation into the case.</p>
              <p>Police in Britain said on Saturday they had charged one man, 25-year-old Maurice Robinson of Craigavon in Northern Ireland, with 39 counts of manslaughter and other offences including conspiracy to traffic people.</p>
              <p>On Sunday, police said three people arrested in connection with the investigation had been released on bail. All three had been questioned on suspicion of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people.</p>
              <p>Initially, British police believed the victims were Chinese, but later sought help from the Vietnamese community. Chinese and Vietnamese officials were both working closely with British police, the countries' embassies said. </p>
              <p>A Catholic priest in the remote town of Yen Thanh in Nghe An province said on Saturday that he believed most of the dead were likely from Vietnam.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>NO DOCUMENTS</p>
              <p>British police have said very few of the victims were carrying official identification and that they hope to identify the dead through fingerprints, dental records and DNA, as well as photos from friends and relatives.</p>
              <p>In the predominantly Catholic area of northern Vietnam from which the suspected victims came, churches held candle-lit prayers at the weekend.</p>
              <p>How the victims came to be in the truck is not yet known.</p>
              <p>Some 70% of Vietnamese trafficking cases in the United Kingdom between 2009-2016 were for labor exploitation, including cannabis production and work in nail salons, according to a British government report last year.</p>
              <p>The families of the suspected victims were in Nghe An and Ha Tinh, two of the poorest provinces in communist Vietnam.</p>
              <p>Nghe An was identified as home to many victims of human trafficking who end up in Europe, according to a March report by the Pacific Links Foundation, a U.S.-based anti-trafficking organization. </p>
              <p>Ha Tinh was ravaged by one of Vietnam's worst environmental disasters in 2016 when a steel mill owned by Taiwan's Formosa Plastics contaminated coastal waters, devastating local fishing and tourism industries.</p>
              <p>It was from Ha Tinh that Tra My set out, first to China, in the hope of making it to Britain via France. According to Human Rights Space, a civic network based in Vietnam, she sent one final apologetic message home.</p>
              <p>""I'm sorry, mum and dad. My path abroad was not a success. I love you both so much. I can’t breathe. I'm from Nghen Town, Can Loc District, Ha Tinh, Vietnam ... I am sorry, mum,"" the message said.</p>

            "	2019-10-27 13:03:28 GMT+00:00	"CAN LOC, Vietnam (Reuters) - Police in Vietnam took hair and blood samples on Sunday to get DNA from relatives of people feared to be among the 39 who died in the back of a truck near London last week, their family members said.
The bodies were found on Wednesday in a truck container in Grays, about 32 km (20 miles) east of central London and British police are still trying to establish the identity of victims who in many cases lacked identity documents.
In a poor rice-growing area of northern Vietnam, communities have been plunged into mourning with their hope all but lost for relatives who had set out to seek better lives in Europe and were thought to have been aboard the truck.
The hashtag #RIP39 was trending in Vietnam on widely-used Facebook.
Distraught, Nguyen Dinh Gia said he feared there was very little chance he would ever again see his 20-year-old son, Nguyen Dinh Luong, who had been trying to get to Britain after first making it to France.
""Police from the Ministry of Public Security came to get DNA samples, our hair and blood,"" Nguyen Dinh Gia told Reuters at Can Loc in Ha Tinh province, where sympathizers gathered at the simple house amid lush rice fields to console the family.
""I advised him not to go because I told him that even though our family had always had nothing and our children were always in hardship, but we brought them up just fine,"" Nguyen said.
The father of Pham Thi Tra My, who sent a last text message to her family in the early hours of Wednesday Vietnam time, said police had also been to collect samples of blood and hair.
Vietnam's government did not respond immediately for a request for comment. Vietnam's prime minister has called for an investigation into the case.
Police in Britain said on Saturday they had charged one man, 25-year-old Maurice Robinson of Craigavon in Northern Ireland, with 39 counts of manslaughter and other offences including conspiracy to traffic people.
On Sunday, police said three people arrested in connection with the investigation had been released on bail. All three had been questioned on suspicion of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people.
Initially, British police believed the victims were Chinese, but later sought help from the Vietnamese community. Chinese and Vietnamese officials were both working closely with British police, the countries' embassies said. 
A Catholic priest in the remote town of Yen Thanh in Nghe An province said on Saturday that he believed most of the dead were likely from Vietnam.

NO DOCUMENTS
British police have said very few of the victims were carrying official identification and that they hope to identify the dead through fingerprints, dental records and DNA, as well as photos from friends and relatives.
In the predominantly Catholic area of northern Vietnam from which the suspected victims came, churches held candle-lit prayers at the weekend.
How the victims came to be in the truck is not yet known.
Some 70% of Vietnamese trafficking cases in the United Kingdom between 2009-2016 were for labor exploitation, including cannabis production and work in nail salons, according to a British government report last year.
The families of the suspected victims were in Nghe An and Ha Tinh, two of the poorest provinces in communist Vietnam.
Nghe An was identified as home to many victims of human trafficking who end up in Europe, according to a March report by the Pacific Links Foundation, a U.S.-based anti-trafficking organization. 
Ha Tinh was ravaged by one of Vietnam's worst environmental disasters in 2016 when a steel mill owned by Taiwan's Formosa Plastics contaminated coastal waters, devastating local fishing and tourism industries.
It was from Ha Tinh that Tra My set out, first to China, in the hope of making it to Britain via France. According to Human Rights Space, a civic network based in Vietnam, she sent one final apologetic message home.
""I'm sorry, mum and dad. My path abroad was not a success. I love you both so much. I can’t breathe. I'm from Nghen Town, Can Loc District, Ha Tinh, Vietnam ... I am sorry, mum,"" the message said.

              <p>The bodies were discovered on Wednesday after emergency services were alerted to people in a truck container on an industrial site in Grays, about 32 km (20 miles) east of central London.</p>
              <p>British police said on Saturday that they had charged one man, 25-year-old Maurice Robinson of Craigavon in Northern Ireland, with 39 counts of manslaughter and other offences including conspiracy to traffic people.</p>
              <p>Police initially believed the dead were Chinese, but Beijing said the nationalities had not been confirmed and on Saturday a senior British police officer in charge of identification asked for help from Britain's Vietnamese community.</p>
              <p>Chinese and Vietnamese officials are now both working closely with British police, the two countries' embassies have said. Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc ordered government officials to help establish the identities of the victims and look into cases of Vietnamese citizens sent abroad illegally.</p>
              <p>Father Anthony Dang Huu Nam, a Catholic priest in the remote town of Yen Thanh in northern-central Vietnam's Nghe An province, 300 km (180 miles) south of Hanoi, said he believed most of the dead were likely from Vietnam. He told Reuters he was liaising with family members.</p>
              <p>""The whole district is covered in sorrow,"" Nam said, as prayers for the dead rang out over loudspeakers throughout the misty, rain-soaked town on Saturday. ""This is a catastrophe for our community.""</p>
              <p>On Saturday evening, Nam led around 500 worshippers in prayers for the dead as they held lit candles in the modest, white-walled church in Yen Thanh.</p>
              <p>""We are here to pray for justice and peace, and for the victims of society. We pray for the 39 people who lost their lives on the way to the UK. They are people coming from central Vietnam, our land,"" Nam said.</p>
              <p>Nam said families had told him they knew relatives were traveling to Britain at the time the container truck was traveling, and had been unable to contact their loved ones.</p>
              <p>The British police officer in charge of identifying the victims, Detective Chief Inspector Martin Pasmore, said very few were carrying official identification and that he hoped to identify the dead through fingerprints, dental records and DNA, as well as photos from friends and relatives.</p>
              <p>Police have found more than 500 items within the truck including bags, clothing and mobile phones that need to be assessed. Once a preliminary identification has been made, liaison officers will be deployed to support families.</p>
              <p>Apart from the man charged, who will appear in court on Monday for an initial hearing, three other people are under arrest in Britain on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking. A fourth person is under arrest in Dublin.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>'BEAUTIFUL DAY'</p>
              <p>In Yen Thanh, Nghe An province, dozens of worried relatives of 19-year-old Bui Thi Nhung gathered in the family's small courtyard home where her distraught mother has been unable to rise from her bed.</p>
              <p>""She said she was in France and on the way to the UK, where she has friends and relatives,"" said Nhung's cousin, Hoang Thi Linh.</p>
              <p>""We are waiting and hoping it's not her among the victims, but it's very likely. We pray for her every day. There were two people from my village traveling in that group"".</p>
              <p>In comments under a photo uploaded to Nhung's Facebook account on Monday, two days before the doomed truck was discovered, one friend asked how her journey was going.</p>
              <p>""Not good,"" Nhung replied. ""Almost spring,"" she said, using a term in Vietnamese meaning she had almost reached her destination.</p>
              <p>Other photos on her account show her sightseeing in Brussels on Oct. 18.</p>
              <p>""Such a beautiful day,"" Nhung posted.</p>

            "	2019-10-26 17:57:18 GMT+00:00	"YEN THANH, Vietnam (Reuters) - Several townships in rural Vietnam sank into mourning on Saturday, with communities believing that many of the 39 people found dead in the back of a truck near London this week came from poor, rice-growing areas of the country.
The bodies were discovered on Wednesday after emergency services were alerted to people in a truck container on an industrial site in Grays, about 32 km (20 miles) east of central London.
British police said on Saturday that they had charged one man, 25-year-old Maurice Robinson of Craigavon in Northern Ireland, with 39 counts of manslaughter and other offences including conspiracy to traffic people.
Police initially believed the dead were Chinese, but Beijing said the nationalities had not been confirmed and on Saturday a senior British police officer in charge of identification asked for help from Britain's Vietnamese community.
Chinese and Vietnamese officials are now both working closely with British police, the two countries' embassies have said. Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc ordered government officials to help establish the identities of the victims and look into cases of Vietnamese citizens sent abroad illegally.
Father Anthony Dang Huu Nam, a Catholic priest in the remote town of Yen Thanh in northern-central Vietnam's Nghe An province, 300 km (180 miles) south of Hanoi, said he believed most of the dead were likely from Vietnam. He told Reuters he was liaising with family members.
""The whole district is covered in sorrow,"" Nam said, as prayers for the dead rang out over loudspeakers throughout the misty, rain-soaked town on Saturday. ""This is a catastrophe for our community.""
On Saturday evening, Nam led around 500 worshippers in prayers for the dead as they held lit candles in the modest, white-walled church in Yen Thanh.
""We are here to pray for justice and peace, and for the victims of society. We pray for the 39 people who lost their lives on the way to the UK. They are people coming from central Vietnam, our land,"" Nam said.
Nam said families had told him they knew relatives were traveling to Britain at the time the container truck was traveling, and had been unable to contact their loved ones.
The British police officer in charge of identifying the victims, Detective Chief Inspector Martin Pasmore, said very few were carrying official identification and that he hoped to identify the dead through fingerprints, dental records and DNA, as well as photos from friends and relatives.
Police have found more than 500 items within the truck including bags, clothing and mobile phones that need to be assessed. Once a preliminary identification has been made, liaison officers will be deployed to support families.
Apart from the man charged, who will appear in court on Monday for an initial hearing, three other people are under arrest in Britain on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking. A fourth person is under arrest in Dublin.

'BEAUTIFUL DAY'
In Yen Thanh, Nghe An province, dozens of worried relatives of 19-year-old Bui Thi Nhung gathered in the family's small courtyard home where her distraught mother has been unable to rise from her bed.
""She said she was in France and on the way to the UK, where she has friends and relatives,"" said Nhung's cousin, Hoang Thi Linh.
""We are waiting and hoping it's not her among the victims, but it's very likely. We pray for her every day. There were two people from my village traveling in that group"".
In comments under a photo uploaded to Nhung's Facebook account on Monday, two days before the doomed truck was discovered, one friend asked how her journey was going.
""Not good,"" Nhung replied. ""Almost spring,"" she said, using a term in Vietnamese meaning she had almost reached her destination.
Other photos on her account show her sightseeing in Brussels on Oct. 18.
""Such a beautiful day,"" Nhung posted.
Another person who may have died is Nguyen Dinh Tu, who had been working illegally in Romania, and Germany, where he lost his job.

            "		"* Whole district 'covered in sorrow' - Catholic priest
* Families in desperate wait for news of missing loved ones
* Nghe An province one of Vietnam's poorest
* 25-year-old charged with manslaughter, trafficking
offences
(Adds details from British police)
YEN THANH, Vietnam, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Several townships in
rural Vietnam sank into mourning on Saturday, with communities
believing that many of the 39 people found dead in the back of a
truck near London this week came from poor, rice-growing areas
of the country.
The bodies were discovered on Wednesday after emergency
services were alerted to people in a truck container on an
industrial site in Grays, about 32 km (20 miles) east of central
London.
British police said on Saturday that they had charged one
man, 25-year-old Maurice Robinson of Craigavon in Northern
Ireland, with 39 counts of manslaughter and other offences
including conspiracy to traffic people.
Police initially believed the dead were Chinese, but Beijing
said the nationalities had not been confirmed and on Saturday a
senior British police officer in charge of identification asked
for help from Britain's Vietnamese community.
Chinese and Vietnamese officials are now both working
closely with British police, the two countries' embassies have
said. Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc ordered
government officials to help establish the identities of the
victims and look into cases of Vietnamese citizens sent abroad
illegally.
Father Anthony Dang Huu Nam, a Catholic priest in the remote
town of Yen Thanh in northern-central Vietnam's Nghe An
province, 300 km (180 miles) south of Hanoi, said he believed
most of the dead were likely from Vietnam. He told Reuters he
was liaising with family members.
""The whole district is covered in sorrow,"" Nam said, as
prayers for the dead rang out over loudspeakers throughout the
misty, rain-soaked town on Saturday. ""This is a catastrophe for
our community.""
On Saturday evening, Nam led around 500 worshippers in
prayers for the dead as they held lit candles in the modest,
white-walled church in Yen Thanh.
""We are here to pray for justice and peace, and for the
victims of society. We pray for the 39 people who lost their
lives on the way to the UK. They are people coming from central
Vietnam, our land,"" Nam said.
Nam said families had told him they knew relatives were
travelling to Britain at the time the container truck was
travelling, and had been unable to contact their loved ones.
The British police officer in charge of identifying the
victims, Detective Chief Inspector Martin Pasmore, said very few
were carrying official identification and that he hoped to
identify the dead through fingerprints, dental records and DNA,
as well as photos from friends and relatives.
Police have found more than 500 items within the truck
including bags, clothing and mobile phones that need to be
assessed. Once a preliminary identification has been made,
liaison officers will be deployed to support families.
Apart from the man charged, who will appear in court on
Monday for an initial hearing, three other people are under
arrest in Britain on suspicion of manslaughter and human
trafficking. A fourth person is under arrest in Dublin.

'BEAUTIFUL DAY'
In Yen Thanh, Nghe An province, dozens of worried relatives
of 19-year-old Bui Thi Nhung gathered in the family's small
courtyard home where her distraught mother has been unable to
rise from her bed.
""She said she was in France and on the way to the UK, where
she has friends and relatives,"" said Nhung's cousin, Hoang Thi
Linh.
""We are waiting and hoping it's not her among the victims,
but it's very likely. We pray for her every day. There were two
people from my village travelling in that group"".
In comments under a photo uploaded to Nhung's Facebook
account on Monday, two days before the doomed truck was
discovered, one friend asked how her journey was going.
""Not good,"" Nhung replied. ""Almost spring,"" she said, using
a term in Vietnamese meaning she had almost reached her
destination.
Other photos on her account show her sightseeing in Brussels
on Oct. 18.
""Such a beautiful day,"" Nhung posted.
Another person who may have died is Nguyen Dinh Tu, who had
been working illegally in Romania, and Germany, where he lost
his job.
A few months ago, he asked his wife Hoang Thi Thuong to help
him raise 11,000 pounds ($14,000) to cover the cost of an
illicit trip from Germany to the United Kingdom.
""I lost contact with him on October 21,"" Thuong told
Reuters. ""I have a big debt to pay, no hope, and no energy to do
anything"".
Tu's father said relatives in the United Kingdom had told
him that Tu was inside the truck, and had been planning to pick
him up.
""They were supposed to pick him up at the drop-off point but
they called and said Tu was in that truck,"" Tu's father, Nguyen
Dinh Sat, told Reuters.
""I haven't heard anything from my son"".

PARENTS 'CAN'T BREATHE'
How the victims came to be in the truck is not yet known.
Some 70% of Vietnamese trafficking cases in the United
Kingdom between 2009-2016 were for labour exploitation,
including cannabis production and work in nail bars, according
to a British government report last year.
""Women and girls from rural areas are also considered more
susceptible to trafficking,"" the report said.
British police sought to reassure anyone living in Britain
illegally that they would not be investigated if they came
forward to help with the identification.
""If you come to us, we will do all we can to put our arm
around you and take you through this process, and establish as
quickly as possible whether or not we have your loved involved
in this tragic incident, and try and reunite you,"" Pasmore said.
Nghe An is one of Vietnam's poorest provinces, and home to
many victims of human trafficking who end up in Europe,
according to a March report by the Pacific Links Foundation, a
U.S.-based anti-trafficking organisation.
Other victims are believed to come from the neighbouring
province of Ha Tinh, Father Nam said. In the first eight months

elsewhere, including overseas, according to state media.
The province was ravaged by one of Vietnam's worst
environmental disasters in 2016 when a steel mill owned by
Taiwan's Formosa Plastics contaminated coastal waters,
devastating local fishing and tourism industries.
Another suspected victim from Ha Tinh, 26-year-old Pham Thi
Tra My, had sent a text message to her mother saying she could
not breathe at about the time the truck container was en route
from Belgium to Britain.
""That girl who said in her message that she couldn't breathe

GRAYS, England (Reuters) - Police investigating the deaths of 39 people in a truck near London said they had arrested three more suspects on Friday on suspicion of human trafficking amid signs that some of the dead may be Vietnamese.
As forensic experts began the process of identifying the victims, the Vietnamese embassy in London said families from the southeast Asian country had got in touch about missing relatives. There were growing concerns at least 10 of the victims could have been from Vietnam.
Hoa Nghiem from Human Rights Space, a civic network based in Vietnam, said that Pham Thi Tra My, 26, had sent a text message to her mother saying she could not breathe at about the time the truck container was en route from Belgium to Britain.
""I’m sorry, mum and dad. My path abroad was not a success. I love you both so much. I can’t breathe. I'm from Nghen Town, Can Loc District, Ha Tinh, Vietnam ... I am sorry, Mom,"" the message said, according to Hoa who told Reuters it had come from Tra My's family.
She said Tra My had gone to China and was planning to reach England via France and that the organisation was getting more alerts about possible Vietnamese victims in the refrigerated trunk, which was found in the early hours of Wednesday.
Police have said they believe the dead were Chinese but Beijing said the nationalities had not yet been confirmed. Chinese and Vietnamese officials are now both working closely with British police, their respective embassies said.

She said they would not give any more details about the identities or nationalities of the victims until the formal identification process was complete.
Her officers were still questioning the 25-year-old truck driver on suspicion of murder following the discovery of the bodies in the back of his truck.
He has not been formally identified but a source familiar with the investigation named him as Mo Robinson from the Portadown area of Northern Ireland. 
On Friday, police also arrested a man and woman, both aged 38, in Warrington, northwest England, and a 48-year-old man from Northern Ireland at London's Stansted Airport. They are suspected of conspiracy to traffic people and manslaughter.
The victims - 31 men and eight women - are being moved to a hospital mortuary from a secure location at docks near the industrial estate in Grays about 20 miles (30 km) east of London where the bodies were found.
Post-mortem examinations were beginning to determine how exactly they died while the lengthy process of identifying the deceased was underway.
VietHome, an organisation for the Vietnamese community in Britain, said it had received news from 10 families that their relatives were missing.
For years, illegal immigrants have attempted to reach Britain stowed away in trucks, often from the European mainland. In 2000, 58 Chinese were found dead in a tomato truck at the port of Dover.

GRAYS, England (Reuters) - Police investigating the deaths of 39 people in a truck near London said they had arrested three more suspects on Friday on suspicion of human trafficking amid signs that some of the dead may be Vietnamese.
As forensic experts began the process of identifying the victims, the Vietnamese embassy in London said families from the southeast Asian country had got in touch about missing relatives. There were growing concerns at least 10 of the victims could have been from Vietnam.
Hoa Nghiem from Human Rights Space, a civic network based in Vietnam, said that Pham Thi Tra My, 26, had sent a text message to her mother saying she could not breathe at about the time the truck container was en route from Belgium to Britain.
""I’m sorry, mum and dad. My path abroad was not a success. I love you both so much. I can’t breathe. I'm from Nghen Town, Can Loc District, Ha Tinh, Vietnam ... I am sorry, Mom,"" the message said, according to Hoa who told Reuters it had come from Tra My's family.
She said Tra My had gone to China and was planning to reach England via France and that the organization was getting more alerts about possible Vietnamese victims in the refrigerated trunk, which was found in the early hours of Wednesday.
Police have said they believe the dead were Chinese but Beijing said the nationalities had not yet been confirmed. Chinese and Vietnamese officials are now both working closely with British police, their respective embassies said.
""We owe it to those who have died to get this investigation right and speculation is not helpful,"" Essex Police's Deputy Chief Constable Pippa Mills told reporters. ""It may in fact hinder our investigation and its progress.""
She said they would not give any more details about the identities or nationalities of the victims until the formal identification process was complete.
Her officers were still questioning the 25-year-old truck driver on suspicion of murder following the discovery of the bodies in the back of his truck.
He has not been formally identified but a source familiar with the investigation named him as Mo Robinson from the Portadown area of Northern Ireland. 
On Friday, police also arrested a man and woman, both aged 38, in Warrington, northwest England, and a 48-year-old man from Northern Ireland at London's Stansted Airport. They are suspected of conspiracy to traffic people and manslaughter.
The victims - 31 men and eight women - are being moved to a hospital mortuary from a secure location at docks near the industrial estate in Grays about 20 miles (30 km) east of London where the bodies were found.
Post-mortem examinations were beginning to determine how exactly they died while the lengthy process of identifying the deceased was underway.
VietHome, an organization for the Vietnamese community in Britain, said it had received news from 10 families that their relatives were missing.
For years, illegal immigrants have attempted to reach Britain stowed away in trucks, often from the European mainland. In 2000, 58 Chinese were found dead in a tomato truck at the port of Dover.

BRITAIN 'HAS NOT FULFILLED RESPONSIBILITY'
""We hope that the British side can as soon as possible confirm and verify the identities of the victims, ascertain what happened and severely punish criminals involved in the case,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily news briefing.
China's Global Times, which is published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, said in a Friday editorial that Britain should bear some responsibility for the deaths.

NAIROBI, Oct 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda has
sought to reassure sexual minorities that they are safe, saying
it has no plans to introduce the death penalty for gay sex after
reports of rising homophobic attacks.
LGBT+ rights campaigners in Uganda have expressed concerns
about a spate of attacks after a minister said earlier this

colloquially known as ""Kill the Gays"".
In a statement on Thursday, President Yoweri Museveni's

""On allegations that members of minority communities have

Gay sex carries a possible life sentence in Uganda, one of
the most difficult countries in Africa to be a sexual minority
where there is increasing confrontation over sexual freedom.
Members of the LGBT+ community say they risk physical
attacks in their daily life and routinely encounter harassment,
as well as facing prejudice over work, housing and health care.
Campaigners have reported a spate of attacks this year,
including four murders. The latest was on Oct. 4 when a gay
rights activist was bludgeoned to death.
Earlier this week 16 LGBT+ activists were detained and
charged for having gay sex after police raided their charity
office and residence, forcing them to undergo anal examinations.
Last weekend a gay Rwandan refugee was beaten outside his
office in Kampala and a lesbian woman physically assaulted by
her doctor, say activists.
Police said they had not registered any cases of assaults
specifically targeting sexual minorities.
Uganda's minister of health said on Friday that she was
aware of some of the attacks on the LGBT+ community and appealed
to health care providers not to discriminate against them.
LGBT+ activists welcomed the statements, but said more
action was needed to ensure sexual minorities could live free

""We would also urge the government to enact legislation

A spokesperson for President Museveni later denied the plan,
saying Uganda's current penal law - which provides for up to
life imprisonment for gay sex - was sufficient.

by tourists. Visitors can still walk up and down, but offenders
of the sitting ban can be fined up to 400 euros ($444).
The site was largely shut between October 2015 and September
2016 for a private restoration after the 135 steps had become
loose, stained and cracked under the strain of daily use by both
residents and visitors.

              <p>SAHEL SELIM, Egypt, Oct 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -
In a small village 45 minutes from the city of Assiut, in
southern Egypt, a group of farmers and their families gathered
to watch a theatre performance that aimed to find the funny side
of climate change.
The hour-long comedy, which has so far been performed in 50
villages in the Upper Egypt region, in the country's south,
tells the story of a farmer who refuses to pay for a new, more
water-efficient agricultural canal.</p>
              <p>When a snake bites him and he is thought to be dead, the
farmer hears how much his family and neighbours hated him
because he rejected modern farming methods. At the end of the
show, he changes his perspective.</p>
              <p>The play is part of a $7-million project funded by the World
Food Programme (WFP) and managed by the Egyptian Ministry of
Agriculture that aims to help farmers in the region cope better
with climate change threats through modern technology,
sustainable growing techniques and better understanding of
climate issues.</p>
              <p>Organisers say the project, which started in 2013 and is
scheduled to end early next year, has boosted the production of
some major crops by at least a third and drastically cut water
consumption on the farms involved.</p>
              <p>It is one in a series of efforts the Egyptian government has
made over the past decade to limit the negative impact of
climate change on farmers across the country.</p>
              <p>""Community mobilisation on the issue of climate change can
encourage many people to embrace the ideas of the project. And
theatre is one of the methods to mobilise the community,"" said
Ayam Abu el-Hagag, an actor in the traveling troupe and also an
agricultural advisor.</p>
              <p>He noted that each time the troupe delivers a joke on stage,
the characters explain the information to make it accessible to
all farmers, even those with little or no formal education.</p>
              <p>""Comedy helps people understand things easier,"" he added.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>HIGHLY VULNERABLE</p>
              <p>Climate change has been a major challenge for Egypt and
according to the WFP, ""southern Egypt is one of the areas most
vulnerable to climate change within the region"".</p>
              <p>Environmental groups regard Egypt as one of the countries
most threatened by the negative effects of climate change, which
include sea-level rise, water poverty, and deteriorating public
health and ecosystems.
The WFP forecasts that Upper Egypt could lose up to 30% of
its food production by 2050 as climate change brings more
extreme weather and other threats.</p>
              <p>Saber Osman, director of the climate change adaptation
department at Egypt's Ministry of Environment, told the Thomson
Reuters Foundation that losses could lead to a major crisis for
Egypt's farming sector.</p>
              <p>Agriculture represents almost 15% of the country's gross
domestic product and employs about a third of the workforce, he
said.</p>
              <p>The idea behind the WFP project is to get farmers involved
in the frontline fight against climate change and stamp out bad
farming habits, said the project's director, Othman el-Sheikh.</p>
              <p>That includes encouraging farmers to plant crop varieties
that require less water and to follow new irrigation methods to
reduce water consumption.</p>
              <p>Farmers also learn how to combine traditional farming
techniques with more modern technology, such as solar-powered
irrigation pumps and an app that alerts farmers to incoming
weather events.</p>
              <p>One main focus for the project is to help farmers work
together, to cut the cost of seeds by buying them in bulk and
planting them across several neighbouring farms, el-Sheikh
explained.</p>
              <p>""Fragmented agricultural holdings are common throughout
Egypt in general and in Upper Egypt in particular,"" he said.</p>
              <p>When they work independently, many farmers cannot afford to
access high-quality resources, which lowers their productivity
and leads to about 10% of land lying fallow, he added.</p>
              <p>The initiative helps farmers organise into groups of at
least 70, who agree to pool their resources.</p>
              <p>Every planting season, the Society Development Association
in Sahel Selim, which is working with the WFP on the project,
buys enough seed for all 70 farmers and divides the seeds
equally among them.</p>
              <p>The farmers carry out the sowing and eventual harvesting
together, cutting costs by sharing equipment and manpower,
el-Sheikh explained.</p>
              <p>The hope is that once the project ends, the farmer groups
will be making enough revenue to allow them to buy high-quality
seeds for themselves, he said.</p>
              <p>El-Sheikh added that almost 2,000 farms have been
consolidated into larger farming groups through the project in
the past three years.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE</p>
              <p>The WFP project also runs a loan program that provides
villagers with goats and ducks to give them an alternative
source of income in case their crops fail.</p>
              <p>Sabrine Haridi, a 33-year-old mother of four children in
Sahel Selim, said she got a loan to acquire 38 ducks, which
allow her to cover the family's expenses, even in seasons when
her husband's wheat harvest falls short.</p>
              <p>She sells some of the ducks for their meat and rears more
from eggs, selling them when they mature. Any profit she makes
goes toward paying off the loan.</p>
              <p>""Two years ago, I was desperate because my husband could not
afford our daily needs. I am now financially independent,"" she
told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p>""When my husband fails to get the expected money from his
crop due to climate change, I pay for whatever we need,
including food, clothes and school expenses,"" she added.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>'IN GOD'S HANDS'</p>
              <p>Since the project was launched in Egypt in 2013, half a
million farmers have become involved, said el-Sheikh</p>
              <p>He told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that applying the new
methods has increased wheat production by 30% to 40%, boosted
sugarcane output by about 30% and reduced water consumption by a
third.</p>
              <p>But getting to that point was not easy, said Osman at the
environment ministry.</p>
              <p>""Community resistance to adopting methods for coping with
climate change is common in Egyptian villages,"" he said, adding
that some farmers do not see climate change as an issue that can
be addressed because it is ""in God's hands"".</p>
              <p>El-Sheikh said that some farmers used to ask him, ""What
would you do to combat climate change? Would you change God's
weather?""</p>
              <p>He told them the efforts only aimed to help farmers cope
with changing weather, not shift the weather itself.</p>
              <p>""Convincing farmers to use modern technology and advanced
agricultural means, as well as encouraging women to take part in
the project, are some of the biggest challenges we face,"" El
Sheikh added.</p>
              <p>Hassan Bekheet, 53, said he didn't need much convincing to
swap his maize crops for drought-tolerant sorghum when he joined
the project in Sahel Selim.</p>
              <p>Once he made the switch, his crop yield increased by about
25%, as did his revenues, he said, while his costs went down by

              <p>BANGKOK, Oct 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Almost 2,000
informal settlements in Delhi are set to be legalised under a
new law agreed by the government this week, which ministers said
would give more than 4 million residents the right to own their
homes in India's capital.</p>
              <p>India's cabinet this week passed a bill to regularise 1,797
unauthorised slums in the country's most populous city, giving
residents ownership rights at ""minimal rates"" that would enable
them to build and sell properties and take loans.</p>
              <p>Mapping is to begin shortly, according to a statement from
the ministry of housing and urban affairs, with the bill due to
be presented for passage during the next session of parliament
from mid-November.</p>
              <p>""It will transform the lives of more than 40 lakh (4
million) residents who came to Delhi in search of a better life
and livelihood but were forced to live in squalor,"" said Housing
Minister Hardeep Singh Puri.</p>
              <p>""Besides providing a legitimate claim to the property, the
decision will encourage property holders to invest in safe
structures, thereby improving living conditions in these
colonies substantially,"" he said at a press briefing this week.</p>
              <p>The plan to regularise Delhi's unauthorised settlements had
been floated for more than a decade. Earlier this year, the
Delhi government said it would study about 1,700 such
settlements and consider a plan to legalise them.</p>
              <p>Most inhabitants are migrant workers from other parts of
India who cannot afford regular housing in the city of more than
18 million people.</p>
              <p>Authorities have built roads and drains in some settlements,
but many lack basic facilities and residents face the constant
threat of eviction, according to housing rights activists.</p>
              <p>Under the proposed law, authorities will map the boundaries
of the slum areas, and prepare a plan. Residents will have to

            "		"By Rina Chandran
BANGKOK, Oct 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Almost 2,000
informal settlements in Delhi are set to be legalised under a
new law agreed by the government this week, which ministers said
would give more than 4 million residents the right to own their
homes in India's capital.
India's cabinet this week passed a bill to regularise 1,797
unauthorised slums in the country's most populous city, giving
residents ownership rights at ""minimal rates"" that would enable
them to build and sell properties and take loans.
Mapping is to begin shortly, according to a statement from
the ministry of housing and urban affairs, with the bill due to
be presented for passage during the next session of parliament
from mid-November.
""It will transform the lives of more than 40 lakh (4
million) residents who came to Delhi in search of a better life
and livelihood but were forced to live in squalor,"" said Housing
Minister Hardeep Singh Puri.
""Besides providing a legitimate claim to the property, the
decision will encourage property holders to invest in safe
structures, thereby improving living conditions in these
colonies substantially,"" he said at a press briefing this week.
The plan to regularise Delhi's unauthorised settlements had
been floated for more than a decade. Earlier this year, the
Delhi government said it would study about 1,700 such
settlements and consider a plan to legalise them.
Most inhabitants are migrant workers from other parts of
India who cannot afford regular housing in the city of more than
18 million people.
Authorities have built roads and drains in some settlements,
but many lack basic facilities and residents face the constant
threat of eviction, according to housing rights activists.
Under the proposed law, authorities will map the boundaries
of the slum areas, and prepare a plan. Residents will have to
provide basic documentation and pay a nominal charge to register
their property and receive the title, Puri said.
""It will pave the way for incentivised planned urbanisation,
and transform urban squalor into modern urban spaces with modern
amenities. Work will start immediately,"" he said.
Worldwide, about 1 billion people live in slums and informal
settlements. By 2030, 3 billion people will lack access to
adequate and affordable housing, according to UN-Habitat, the
United Nations' settlements agency.
Regularising Delhi's unauthorised colonies has been a
campaign promise of many political parties, and this week's
announcement comes months ahead of a local election that must be
held by February next year.
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the federal
government had declined to act on the city's earlier proposal
for legalising informal settlements.
""While welcome and urgently required, the announcement to
regularise 'unauthorised' colonies has been made so many times
without being implemented, that it is unclear what it means,""
said Shivani Chaudhry, executive director, Housing and Land

housing, and protection from demolition and eviction.""

              <p>GRAYS, England (Reuters) - Police were given more time on Thursday to question a driver arrested on suspicion of murder after 39 people, believed to be Chinese nationals, were found dead in a refrigerated truck near London, with the investigation focusing on human trafficking.</p>
              <p>Officers searched three properties in the County Armagh area of Northern Ireland. The driver has not been formally identified but a source familiar with the investigation said he was Mo Robinson from the Portadown area of the British province.</p>
              <p>Paramedics and police found the bodies of 31 men and eight women on Wednesday in a truck container on an industrial estate at Grays in Essex, about 20 miles (30 km) east of London. </p>
              <p>For years, illegal immigrants have attempted to reach Britain stowed away in trucks, often from the European mainland. In 2000, 58 Chinese were found dead in a tomato truck at the port of Dover.</p>
              <p>""We read with heavy heart the reports about the death of 39 people in Essex,"" the Chinese Embassy said in a statement.</p>
              <p>Police were given permission by magistrates to detain the 25-year-old driver for an additional 24 hours on Thursday.    </p>
              <p>The National Crime Agency, which targets serious and organised crime, said it was helping the investigation and working urgently to identify any gangs involved.</p>
              <p>Shaun Sawyer, national spokesman for British police on human trafficking, said thousands of people were seeking to come to the United Kingdom illegally. While they were able to rescue many of those smuggled in, Britain was perceived by organised crime as a potentially easy target for traffickers.</p>
              <p>""You can't turn the United Kingdom into a fortress. We have to accept that we have permeable borders,"" he told BBC radio.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>DIGNITY</p>
              <p>The trailer part of the truck arrived at Purfleet docks in Essex from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge - as did the vehicle involved in 2000.</p>
              <p>The chairman of Zeebrugge, Dirk de Fauw, said he believed the victims died in the trailer before it arrived there.</p>
              <p>""We have a safe system with safety guards, we have cameras everywhere, we have policemen in the streets of Zeebrugge, in the dunes with horses,"" de Fauw, who is also mayor of the nearby city of Bruges, told Reuters Television.</p>
              <p>""I think they were dead before they are coming here to Zeebrugge. I think so.""</p>
              <p>The truck's red cab unit, which had ""Ireland"" emblazoned on the windscreen along with the message ""The Ultimate Dream"", entered Britain via Holyhead in north Wales, having started its journey in Dublin, police said.</p>
              <p>Irish company Global Trailer Rentals said it owned the trailer and had rented it out on Oct. 15 from its depot in County Monaghan at a rate of 275 euros ($305) a week, Irish broadcaster RTE said. The firm said it was unaware of what it was to be used for, RTE added. </p>
              <p>The discovery of the bodies was made at 1.40 a.m. just over an hour after the container arrived in Purfleet, not far from the industrial estate in Grays. </p>
              <p>The vehicle has been moved to a secure site at nearby Tilbury Docks where forensic work can take place. Officials have set up a book of condolence at civic offices in Grays.</p>
              <p>Eleven bodies were transported on Thursday from the Port of Tilbury to a hospital in the town of Chelmsford for the first post-mortem examinations and identification.        </p>
              <p>Essex police said their priority was to ensure dignity for the victims in the largest investigation of its kind undertaken by the force, which was likely to be time-consuming.</p>
              <p>""I want to express my sincere condolences to the families of the 39 people who have sadly lost their lives,"" Essex Chief Constable Ben-Julian Harrington said. ""We will conduct this investigation with respect for every single one of those people.""    </p>
              <p>The head of the Road Haulage Association said traffickers were ""upping their game"" and closer cooperation with European nations was needed, although that may be complicated by Britain's potential exit from the European Union. </p>

GRAYS, England (Reuters) - Police were given more time on Thursday to question a driver arrested on suspicion of murder after 39 people, believed to be Chinese nationals, were found dead in a refrigerated truck near London, with the investigation focusing on human trafficking.
Officers searched three properties in the County Armagh area of Northern Ireland. The driver has not been formally identified but a source familiar with the investigation said he was Mo Robinson from the Portadown area of the British province.
Paramedics and police found the bodies of 31 men and eight women on Wednesday in a truck container on an industrial estate at Grays in Essex, about 20 miles (30 km) east of London. 
For years, illegal immigrants have attempted to reach Britain stowed away in trucks, often from the European mainland. In 2000, 58 Chinese were found dead in a tomato truck at the port of Dover.
""We read with heavy heart the reports about the death of 39 people in Essex,"" the Chinese Embassy said in a statement.
Police were given permission by magistrates to detain the 25-year-old driver for an additional 24 hours on Thursday.    
The National Crime Agency, which targets serious and organised crime, said it was helping the investigation and working urgently to identify any gangs involved.
Shaun Sawyer, national spokesman for British police on human trafficking, said thousands of people were seeking to come to the United Kingdom illegally. While they were able to rescue many of those smuggled in, Britain was perceived by organised crime as a potentially easy target for traffickers.
""You can't turn the United Kingdom into a fortress. We have to accept that we have permeable borders,"" he told BBC radio.

DIGNITY
The trailer part of the truck arrived at Purfleet docks in Essex from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge - as did the vehicle involved in 2000.
The chairman of Zeebrugge, Dirk de Fauw, said he believed the victims died in the trailer before it arrived there.
""We have a safe system with safety guards, we have cameras everywhere, we have policemen in the streets of Zeebrugge, in the dunes with horses,"" de Fauw, who is also mayor of the nearby city of Bruges, told Reuters Television.
""I think they were dead before they are coming here to Zeebrugge. I think so.""
The truck's red cab unit, which had ""Ireland"" emblazoned on the windscreen along with the message ""The Ultimate Dream"", entered Britain via Holyhead in north Wales, having started its journey in Dublin, police said.
Irish company Global Trailer Rentals said it owned the trailer and had rented it out on Oct. 15 from its depot in County Monaghan at a rate of 275 euros ($305) a week, Irish broadcaster RTE said. The firm said it was unaware of what it was to be used for, RTE added. 
The discovery of the bodies was made at 1.40 a.m. just over an hour after the container arrived in Purfleet, not far from the industrial estate in Grays. 
The vehicle has been moved to a secure site at nearby Tilbury Docks where forensic work can take place. Officials have set up a book of condolence at civic offices in Grays.
Eleven bodies were transported on Thursday from the Port of Tilbury to a hospital in the town of Chelmsford for the first post-mortem examinations and identification.        
Essex police said their priority was to ensure dignity for the victims in the largest investigation of its kind undertaken by the force, which was likely to be time-consuming.
""I want to express my sincere condolences to the families of the 39 people who have sadly lost their lives,"" Essex Chief Constable Ben-Julian Harrington said. ""We will conduct this investigation with respect for every single one of those people.""    
The head of the Road Haulage Association said traffickers were ""upping their game"" and closer cooperation with European nations was needed, although that may be complicated by Britain's potential exit from the European Union. 
""There is simply not enough being done in terms of security, in terms of the protection of vehicles across Europe,"" Richard Burnett told BBC TV.

              <p>BRUSSELS (Reuters) - When France shut the Calais shanty town known as the Jungle in 2016, migrants seeking entry to Britain were forced to look for less safe passage up the coast in Belgium - the route taken by a truck in which 39 bodies were found this week.</p>
              <p>Belgium's federal prosecutors, who handle cases of terrorism and organized crime, said on Thursday they had opened an investigation into the deadly transport. Initial findings showed the truck passed through the Belgian cargo port of Zeebrugge, from where it crossed by ferry to Britain.</p>
              <p>The victims - 31 men and eight women, all believed to be Chinese nationals - were found in a refrigerated truck on an industrial estate 20 miles (32 km) east of London. The driver was detained on suspicion of murder.</p>
              <p>Belgian prosecutors said they were looking into when and where the victims were loaded into the container. Regional British police said a case of human trafficking was suspected.</p>
              <p>This was not the first fatal migrant transport routed through Zeebrugge - a container with the bodies of 58 Chinese inside found in the English port of Dover in 2000 had also come from the Belgian port.</p>
              <p>However, in recent years the focus of migrant efforts to reach Britain was the French port of Calais - across the Channel from Dover - offering more than hourly ferry services and an undersea tunnel on the shortest crossing to the United Kingdom.</p>
              <p>The migrant community in Calais grew to some 6,000 people, most of them in a shanty town dubbed the Jungle, outside Calais until French authorities emptied it in October 2016, saying it was a security and health hazard.</p>
              <p>Cast adrift and driven away from Calais by the Jungle's closure, many migrants looking for the next closest passage points made their way north to neighboring Belgium, said Stef Janssens at that country's federal center of migration.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>MIGRANT ROUTE SHIFTS</p>
              <p>""There was a shift of the route to Britain from Calais to Belgium's E40 highway,"" he said, with people trafficking gangs taking control of parking spots where migrants congregate along the motorway leading from Brussels to the North Sea coast.</p>
              <p>In contrast with Calais, Zeebrugge largely handles cargo with far fewer leisure travelers. </p>

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - When France shut the Calais shanty town known as the Jungle in 2016, migrants seeking entry to Britain were forced to look for less safe passage up the coast in Belgium - the route taken by a truck in which 39 bodies were found this week.
Belgium's federal prosecutors, who handle cases of terrorism and organized crime, said on Thursday they had opened an investigation into the deadly transport. Initial findings showed the truck passed through the Belgian cargo port of Zeebrugge, from where it crossed by ferry to Britain.
The victims - 31 men and eight women, all believed to be Chinese nationals - were found in a refrigerated truck on an industrial estate 20 miles (32 km) east of London. The driver was detained on suspicion of murder.
Belgian prosecutors said they were looking into when and where the victims were loaded into the container. Regional British police said a case of human trafficking was suspected.
This was not the first fatal migrant transport routed through Zeebrugge - a container with the bodies of 58 Chinese inside found in the English port of Dover in 2000 had also come from the Belgian port.
However, in recent years the focus of migrant efforts to reach Britain was the French port of Calais - across the Channel from Dover - offering more than hourly ferry services and an undersea tunnel on the shortest crossing to the United Kingdom.
The migrant community in Calais grew to some 6,000 people, most of them in a shanty town dubbed the Jungle, outside Calais until French authorities emptied it in October 2016, saying it was a security and health hazard.
Cast adrift and driven away from Calais by the Jungle's closure, many migrants looking for the next closest passage points made their way north to neighboring Belgium, said Stef Janssens at that country's federal center of migration.

MIGRANT ROUTE SHIFTS
""There was a shift of the route to Britain from Calais to Belgium's E40 highway,"" he said, with people trafficking gangs taking control of parking spots where migrants congregate along the motorway leading from Brussels to the North Sea coast.
In contrast with Calais, Zeebrugge largely handles cargo with far fewer leisure travelers. 
Dogs and heat scanners are used to detect stowaways though they might not be spotted in sealed, refrigerated containers like the one in which the 39 bodies were discovered this week.
In 2014, an Afghan migrant was found dead in a container that had arrived in the British port of Tilbury, along with 34 who had survived. This also had gone through Zeebrugge, but at a time when the scanner was not working. 
""If they had to open up every container or every truck... there would be trucks (queued up) from here to Brussels. Every day there are 4,000 trucks coming to this port,"" Dirk de Fauw, mayor of the city of Bruges and chairman of adjacent Zeebrugge, told Reuters television.
Smugglers remain on the E40 motorway, Janssens said, but in their hunt for spots with weaker port controls and security, they had headed even further north in the past two years.
""This has also shifted to Antwerp and ports such as Hook of Holland in the Netherlands because these ports are used less and subject to lesser controls,"" Janssens said.
Smuggling migrants is lucrative, he said, with migrants charged up to 6,000 euros ($6,690) for ""guaranteed"" passage to Britain.

              <p>NAIROBI, Oct 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda said
on Thursday it had charged 16 LGBT+ activists with the crime of
gay sex - punishable by life in jail - in what campaigners
called an escalating campaign against sexual minorities in the
east African nation.</p>
              <p>The 16 men, believed to be aged from 22 to 35, were taken
into custody late on Monday at the office of a sexual health
charity where they all worked and lived, fellow activists said.</p>
              <p>Police said they had found lubricants, condoms and
anti-retroviral drugs at the charity, and had conducted anal
examinations on all 16 men.</p>
              <p>""Based on the medical examination report, it was established
that the suspects were involved in sexual acts punishable under
the penal code,"" Kampala Police spokesman Patrick Onyango told
the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p>Fred Enanga, Uganda's national police spokesman, said the
men were charged under sections of the penal code that outlaw
gay sex, and that all had been released on police bond.</p>
              <p>""They will keep reporting to the police on selected dates
pending further guidance from the state attorney's office,""
Enanga said.</p>
              <p>The charity confirmed the men's release on Facebook.</p>
              <p>Gay sex carries a possible life sentence in Uganda, one of
the most difficult countries in Africa to be a sexual minority
with increasingly violent confrontation over sexual freedom.</p>
              <p>Members of the LGBT+ community say they risk physical
attacks in their daily life and routinely encounter harassment,
as well as facing prejudice over work, housing and health care.</p>
              <p>Campaigners have reported a spate of attacks this year -
including four murders - with the latest on Oct. 4 when a gay
rights activist was bludgeoned to death.</p>
              <p>Police say they know of no such attacks.</p>
              <p>Earlier this month, a minister proposed introducing the
death penalty for gay sex, a threat retracted by the government
after international donors condemned the move.</p>
              <p>Activists said the raid was a new step-up by police.</p>
              <p>""Normally we will hear of maybe one arrest of someone from
the community under these anti-gay laws in one month, but it is
really unusual to see 16 people charged like this,"" said Frank

            "		"(Updates with activists charged, released)
By Nita Bhalla
NAIROBI, Oct 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda said
on Thursday it had charged 16 LGBT+ activists with the crime of
gay sex - punishable by life in jail - in what campaigners
called an escalating campaign against sexual minorities in the
east African nation.
The 16 men, believed to be aged from 22 to 35, were taken
into custody late on Monday at the office of a sexual health
charity where they all worked and lived, fellow activists said.
Police said they had found lubricants, condoms and
anti-retroviral drugs at the charity, and had conducted anal
examinations on all 16 men.
""Based on the medical examination report, it was established
that the suspects were involved in sexual acts punishable under
the penal code,"" Kampala Police spokesman Patrick Onyango told
the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Fred Enanga, Uganda's national police spokesman, said the
men were charged under sections of the penal code that outlaw
gay sex, and that all had been released on police bond.
""They will keep reporting to the police on selected dates
pending further guidance from the state attorney's office,""
Enanga said.
The charity confirmed the men's release on Facebook.
Gay sex carries a possible life sentence in Uganda, one of
the most difficult countries in Africa to be a sexual minority
with increasingly violent confrontation over sexual freedom.
Members of the LGBT+ community say they risk physical
attacks in their daily life and routinely encounter harassment,
as well as facing prejudice over work, housing and health care.
Campaigners have reported a spate of attacks this year -
including four murders - with the latest on Oct. 4 when a gay
rights activist was bludgeoned to death.
Police say they know of no such attacks.
Earlier this month, a minister proposed introducing the
death penalty for gay sex, a threat retracted by the government
after international donors condemned the move.
Activists said the raid was a new step-up by police.
""Normally we will hear of maybe one arrest of someone from
the community under these anti-gay laws in one month, but it is
really unusual to see 16 people charged like this,"" said Frank
Mugisha, executive director of Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG).
The men all worked for a charity called ""Let's Walk Uganda"",
whose offices are on the outskirts of the capital Kampala.
They were initially taken into ""protective custody"" after a
crowd yelling homophobic slogans surrounded their office, rights
groups said. Police said the group was detained after they were
alerted to ""illegal activities"" by the community.
Under Uganda's British, colonial-era penal code, anyone who
has ""carnal knowledge against the order of nature"" - gay sex -
or who accedes to anal sex is liable to life imprisonment.

              <p>TOKYO, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
and South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon agreed on Thursday
on the importance of cooperating on North Korea and other
issues, seeking to rebuild relations amid a bitter feud over
history and trade.</p>
              <p>But there was scant sign of real progress and Abe reiterated
that South Korea would need to keep its promises for ties
between the two Asian allies of Washington to improve.</p>
              <p>Relations between Tokyo and Seoul have deteriorated to their
lowest in decades since South Korea's top court last October
ordered some Japanese firms to compensate Koreans forced to work
in their wartime mines and factories.</p>
              <p>Japan, which says the matter was settled by a 1965 treaty,
calls the decision a violation of international law, and the
feud has spilled over into trade and security matters.</p>
              <p>About 100 journalists were present at the start of talks in
Tokyo, the highest-level meeting between the two sides since the
row flared. The meeting began with a handshake but no smiles.</p>
              <p>Abe urged Seoul to keep its promises - a reference to the
1965 treaty - in order to restore relations, according to
statement issued by Japan's foreign ministry.</p>
              <p>""Our two nations are important neighbours for each other,
and keeping in contact over North Korea, bilateral relations and
our ties with the United States are quite important,"" Abe was
quoted as telling Lee.</p>
              <p>""Relations are currently in quite a severe state but should
not be left that way. If South Korea can keep bilateral
promises, that could be a chance to return to a healthy
relationship,"" Abe added.</p>
              <p>The statement also quoted Lee as saying he shared the view
that dialogue was important, while a parallel statement from
South Korea's foreign ministry said Lee agreed relations should
not be left in their current difficult state.</p>
              <p>Abe also repeated Tokyo's stance that the South Korean court
ruling overturned the basis of two-way ties.</p>
              <p>“Abe said the South Korean top court ruling is in clear

the legal framework for Japan-South Korea relations,"" Japanese

              <p>In a sign that gaps remain wide, Lee told Abe: ""South Korea
has also respected and complied with the 1965 Treaty on Basic
Relations and Claims, and will continue to do so,"" according to
Seoul's statement.</p>
              <p>Lee, who was in Tokyo to attend Japanese Emperor Naruhito's
enthronement ceremony this week, delivered to Abe a personal
letter from South Korean President Moon Jae-in in which Moon
called for attempts to resolve the pending bilateral issues,

              <p>DIFFICULT HISTORY</p>
              <p>The animosity between Japan and South Korea is linked to the

the mobilisation of forced labour at companies and women in
wartime military brothels, and a row over the ownership of

              <p>Earlier this year, the dispute escalated when Japan
tightened export controls on materials vital for South Korean
chipmakers. It then dropped Seoul from a list of countries

South Korea.</p>
              <p>The spat has prompted protests in South Korea, where

              <p>In August, South Korea announced it would scrap a military

The animosity between Japan and South Korea is linked to the

the mobilisation of forced labour at companies and women in

Earlier this year, the dispute escalated when Japan

              <p>BARCELONA, Oct 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The Green
Climate Fund, one of the main sources of finance for developing
nations to tackle climate change, is hoping wealthy countries
will pledge between $9 billion and $10 billion to refill its
coffers at a conference in Paris on Friday.</p>
              <p>Climate finance analysts said the outcome would be key to
building trust with poorer states preparing more ambitious
climate action plans which are due to be submitted to the United
Nations by the end of 2020.</p>
              <p>Environment and development groups are calling for at least
$15 billion in new commitments for the Green Climate Fund (GCF),
saying projects that may use up close to that amount are already
in the pipeline, with needs only increasing as the planet warms.</p>
              <p>Lucile Dufour, international policy advisor with Climate
Action Network France, said the GCF replenishment was happening
""at a crucial point in the fight against climate change"", and
called on donors to double their contributions at a minimum.</p>
              <p>""This is a matter of justice and survival for developing
countries and the most vulnerable communities,"" she told
journalists, noting the devastation from increasingly wild
weather around the world.</p>
              <p>The fund's executive director, Yannick Glemarec, told the
Thomson Reuters Foundation this week's meeting would be a
""success"" if pledges exceeded the $9.3 billion garnered at its
first conference in 2014.</p>
              <p>Since late last year the fund has secured pledges of about
$7.4 billion from 16 countries for 2020-2023, with large donors
like Germany, France and Britain doubling 2014 contributions.</p>
              <p>New announcements from some other potentially large donors
are expected to raise that figure on Friday, including Japan,
Italy, Switzerland, Finland and Belgium.</p>
              <p>""It is not easy right now for any kind of financial
contributors to dramatically increase their contribution because
most of them are facing real budgetary constraints,"" Glemarec
said, noting some ""exceptional efforts"" to double donations.</p>
              <p>Despite total promises of just over $10 billion for the
fund's first five years, U.S. President Donald Trump, a
climate-change sceptic, refused to deliver two-thirds of his
country's  $3 billion pledge.</p>
              <p>Currency fluctuations meanwhile further cut the actual total
available to the fund, to about $7.2 billion.</p>
              <p>Glemarec and others expressed hope the United States could
""re-engage"" with the fund in coming years.</p>
              <p>Joe Thwaites, a climate finance researcher with
Washington-based World Resources Institute, said domestic
politics meant it was ""disappointing but not surprising"" that
the United States and Australia had indicated they would not
contribute now.</p>
              <p>He also urged some countries whose new pledges were flat or
up slightly, like Canada and the Netherlands, to give more.</p>
              <p>A report from the U.N. climate science panel showed last
year that climate action financing, both from governments and
business, had so far been inadequate, Thwaites said.</p>
              <p>""There is a very clear sense that we need to see major
increases and particularly for adaptation, where the needs are
only going to rise.""</p>
              <p/>
              <p>MORE FOR THE POOREST?</p>
              <p>The GCF has allocated some $5.2 billion to 111 projects in
99 countries ranging from green, low-cost housing in Mongolia's
polluted capital and a rapid-transit bus system in Karachi using
methane to restoring climate-threatened ecosystems in Namibia.</p>
              <p>It expects to have parcelled out the rest of its initial pot
by the end of 2019, Glemarec said, adding he hoped it would be
able to grow its project pipeline in future.</p>
              <p>Aid agencies praise the fund's push to divide its money
between projects to reduce planet-warming emissions and efforts
to adapt to climate shifts and rising seas, as adaptation has
received only about a fifth of global climate finance until now.</p>
              <p>Glemarec said that since 2015 nearly 70% of the $1.9 billion
the fund had allocated for adaptation was for projects in the
most vulnerable poor countries, African nations and small island
states, stressing the aim was to maintain or raise that share.</p>
              <p>Liane Schalatek, associate director at the Heinrich Böll
Foundation North America and civil society observer at the GCF,
said it should increasingly work with approved ministries and

            "		"By Megan Rowling
BARCELONA, Oct 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The Green
Climate Fund, one of the main sources of finance for developing
nations to tackle climate change, is hoping wealthy countries
will pledge between $9 billion and $10 billion to refill its
coffers at a conference in Paris on Friday.
Climate finance analysts said the outcome would be key to
building trust with poorer states preparing more ambitious
climate action plans which are due to be submitted to the United
Nations by the end of 2020.
Environment and development groups are calling for at least
$15 billion in new commitments for the Green Climate Fund (GCF),
saying projects that may use up close to that amount are already
in the pipeline, with needs only increasing as the planet warms.
Lucile Dufour, international policy advisor with Climate
Action Network France, said the GCF replenishment was happening
""at a crucial point in the fight against climate change"", and
called on donors to double their contributions at a minimum.
""This is a matter of justice and survival for developing
countries and the most vulnerable communities,"" she told
journalists, noting the devastation from increasingly wild
weather around the world.
The fund's executive director, Yannick Glemarec, told the
Thomson Reuters Foundation this week's meeting would be a
""success"" if pledges exceeded the $9.3 billion garnered at its
first conference in 2014.
Since late last year the fund has secured pledges of about
$7.4 billion from 16 countries for 2020-2023, with large donors
like Germany, France and Britain doubling 2014 contributions.
New announcements from some other potentially large donors
are expected to raise that figure on Friday, including Japan,
Italy, Switzerland, Finland and Belgium.
""It is not easy right now for any kind of financial
contributors to dramatically increase their contribution because
most of them are facing real budgetary constraints,"" Glemarec
said, noting some ""exceptional efforts"" to double donations.
Despite total promises of just over $10 billion for the
fund's first five years, U.S. President Donald Trump, a
climate-change sceptic, refused to deliver two-thirds of his
country's  $3 billion pledge.
Currency fluctuations meanwhile further cut the actual total
available to the fund, to about $7.2 billion.
Glemarec and others expressed hope the United States could
""re-engage"" with the fund in coming years.
Joe Thwaites, a climate finance researcher with
Washington-based World Resources Institute, said domestic
politics meant it was ""disappointing but not surprising"" that
the United States and Australia had indicated they would not
contribute now.
He also urged some countries whose new pledges were flat or
up slightly, like Canada and the Netherlands, to give more.
A report from the U.N. climate science panel showed last
year that climate action financing, both from governments and
business, had so far been inadequate, Thwaites said.
""There is a very clear sense that we need to see major
increases and particularly for adaptation, where the needs are
only going to rise.""

MORE FOR THE POOREST?
The GCF has allocated some $5.2 billion to 111 projects in
99 countries ranging from green, low-cost housing in Mongolia's
polluted capital and a rapid-transit bus system in Karachi using
methane to restoring climate-threatened ecosystems in Namibia.
It expects to have parcelled out the rest of its initial pot
by the end of 2019, Glemarec said, adding he hoped it would be
able to grow its project pipeline in future.
Aid agencies praise the fund's push to divide its money
between projects to reduce planet-warming emissions and efforts
to adapt to climate shifts and rising seas, as adaptation has
received only about a fifth of global climate finance until now.
Glemarec said that since 2015 nearly 70% of the $1.9 billion
the fund had allocated for adaptation was for projects in the
most vulnerable poor countries, African nations and small island
states, stressing the aim was to maintain or raise that share.
Liane Schalatek, associate director at the Heinrich Böll
Foundation North America and civil society observer at the GCF,
said it should increasingly work with approved ministries and
agencies in developing states to reach local communities.
""There needs to be a focus on the poorest and most
disenfranchised people who are usually not given voice and much
opportunity to participate in or benefit from decision-making on
climate change,"" she said.

BOGOTA/MEXICO CITY, Oct 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -
A rgentina is seeking the extradition from Mexico of a former spy
accused of running a criminal organization that sexually
exploited women, a move one trafficking survivor said would be a
""historic milestone"" in the fight against the crime.
Mexican authorities arrested Raul Martins earlier this month
in the seaside city of Cancun following an extradition request
from a judge in Argentina, where prosecutors said he faced human
trafficking, racketeering and money laundering charges.
Argentine prosecutors say Martins, who is a dual
Argentine-Mexican national, exploited women and laundered the
profits in at least 10 upscale brothels, cabaret bars and
nightclubs in Buenos Aires over nearly three decades.
The Thomson Reuters Foundation was unable to reach Martins'
lawyer, Ricardo Hernandez.
In interviews with local media, Hernandez is quoted as
saying Martins' detention was illegal and that his case was
political ahead of a presidential election in Argentina later
this month.
""The organization that Raul Martins led has been working, is
working, since the 1990s,"" Alejandra Mangano, federal prosecutor
at Argentina's anti-trafficking prosecutor's office, told the
Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Alika Kinan, a trafficking survivor who police freed from a
brothel in southern Argentina in 2012, said it was significant
that someone with links to the government was being sought by
prosecutors in such a case.
""The Raul Martins case is a very important and landmark case

Martins graduated from Argentina's National Intelligence

agency for more than a decade, according to local media reports.
The U.S. State Department's 2019 report on human trafficking
said Argentina had ""increased investigations prosecutions, and

""There are cases where public officials are clients of such

Argentine authorities have convicted 14 public officials
including police and one judicial official on charges of human
trafficking since 2008, she said.

'TOP SECRET'
Martins was ""provisionally detained for extradition"" and is
being held in prison in Mexico City, the office of Mexico's
attorney general said in a statement, without giving further
details.
It is unclear when or whether Martins, who took Mexican
nationality after settling in the country in the mid-2000s, will
be extradited.
It takes typically more than a year for extradition requests
to be decided, according to legal experts.

              <p>ADDIS ABABA, Oct 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From
ex-prostitutes making jewellery out of bullet casing to drones
delivering blood, rising numbers of businesses with a mission to
help address social problems are emerging in Ethiopia as the
economy opens up.</p>
              <p>An estimated 55,000 social enterprises operate in Ethiopia,
the second-most populous country in Africa and fastest growing
economy in the region where about a quarter of 109 million
people live below the poverty line, according to the World Bank.</p>
              <p>But the number of ventures set up to do good is on the rise
since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came in 18 months ago and vowed
to open the economy to private investment, raising hopes of
official recognition for the sector and easier access to funds.</p>
              <p>Kibret Abebe, one of Ethiopia's best-known social
entrepreneurs, said the sector would be boosted as Ethiopia
hosts the 12th annual Social Enterprise World Forum (SEWF) this
week, the first developing country to do so.</p>
              <p>""The economy is opening up and we are seeing more social
enterprises in Ethiopia,"" said Abebe, first president of Social
Enterprise Ethiopia, which was set up last year to advance firms
set up to do good that re-invest their profits into their work.</p>
              <p>""Scaling up has been a nightmare in Ethiopia and it's been
hard to collaborate with the government but I'm optimistic this
will change as we have a lot of social problems to fix.""</p>
              <p>Ethiopia's Education Minister Tilaye Gete said hosting SEWF,
attended by more than 1,200 delegates from 50 or so countries,
was a sign of change under Ahmed, who was awarded the Nobel
Peace Prize earlier this month.</p>
              <p>""This is reflective of the overall change in leadership and
mindset across the country,"" said Gete as he officially opened
the three-day conference.</p>
              <p>Abebe, an anaesthetist, was a trailblazer for social
enterprise in Ethiopia when he sold his house to set up TEBITA
Ambulance more than a decade ago after seeing how many road
accident victims struggled to get transport to medical help.</p>
              <p>TEBITA now runs a fleet of 20 ambulances and a college
training paramedics, funding its work by charging patients for
journeys, offering training, as well as providing emergency
services for the national football team.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>HEALTH TO HOUSING</p>
              <p>Abebe said TEBITA was one of thousands of social enterprises
in Ethiopia aiming to help the most needy, with newcomers
focused on agriculture, education, health, housing and IT.</p>
              <p>For example Maisha Technologies PLC is a tech-based social
enterprise trialling advanced drones to deliver blood to health
centres in rural areas where half of maternal deaths occur.</p>
              <p>HelloSolar aims to provide rural communities without
electricity with off-grid energy and affordable payment plans.</p>
              <p>Abebe said young people - with 43% of the population aged
15 or under - were playing a key role in advancing new social
enterprises, many with tech solutions and hoping to create jobs
for the future.</p>
              <p>A 2016 survey by the British Council - which co-hosts SEWF
with local partners - estimated the number of social enterprises
in Ethiopia and found about half were led by people aged under
35 while women led more than a quarter of social enterprises.</p>
              <p>But these firms reported numerous challenges, including the
lack of a policy framework with no distinct formal legal form or
recognised means to register as social enterprises in Ethiopia.</p>
              <p>The biggest barrier, however, was found to be financial -
accessing capital or obtaining grants - so it was critical to
find a revenue stream and one strong enough to support growth.</p>
              <p>Ellilta Products, for example, was set up 2012 to support
sister organisation, Ellilta Women at Risk (EWAR), founded in
1995 to help break the generational cycle of prostitution.</p>
              <p>Headquartered on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, Ellilta
Products' workforce of about 55 includes former prostitutes
making jewellery from bullet casing and scarves and soaps that
are sold locally and overseas to fund the work of EWAR.</p>
              <p>EWAR workers visit red light areas in Addis Ababa to
encourage women to join a year-long rehabilitation programme of
counselling and training while their children go to school.</p>
              <p>Ellilta Products' General Manager Emnet Mersha Seyoum said
so far EWAR has rescued around 1,000 women, with a success rate
of 90% not returning to prostitution.</p>
              <p>Anchilu Alemu, aged about 50, said she was rescued nine
years ago after 18 years as a prostitute and this has given her
and her daughter a new life. She makes scarves at Ellilta and
her daughter went to college and is now married with a child.</p>
              <p>""Before prostitution was the only way I could make money.
This saved me,"" she said as she pulled at a spool of yarn.</p>
              <p>Seyoum said it had been hard to get funding in Ethiopia as
the government did not recognise or understand social
enterprises but she hoped this would change under Ahmed and with
the SEWF in Addis, attended by 1,200 people from 58 nations.</p>
              <p>""Ideally in the future we want to scale up to grow tenfold
so that we can provide jobs to all of the women that we rescue,""
she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

              <p>SEOUL, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The animosity between Japan and
South Korea is entwined with the history of Japan's 1910-45
occupation of the Korean peninsula, the mobilisation of forced
labour at companies and women in wartime brothels, and a row
over the ownership of islets in the sea between the two nations.</p>
              <p>Here is an outline of the issues that bedevil their ties:</p>
              <p/>
              <p>FORCED LABOUR</p>
              <p>Last October, South Korea's Supreme Court ordered Japan's
Nippon Steel &amp; Sumitomo Metal Corp and Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries to compensate some wartime forced labourers.</p>
              <p>The ruling infuriated Tokyo, which sees the former
labourers' right to reparation ceased under a 1965 treaty
normalising diplomatic ties.</p>
              <p>Relations deteriorated when Japan restricted exports of
high-tech material to South Korea in July, while a group of
former labourers requested a court order to forcibly liquidate
Mitsubishi assets for compensation.</p>
              <p>Thousands of South Koreans protested condemning what they
called Japan's ""economic invasion.""</p>
              <p>Last week, a commercial by Japanese clothing brand Uniqlo
stirred a backlash in South Korea as mocking victims of forced
labour and comfort women, prompting a parody video featuring a
90-year-old woman who worked for Mitsubishi to go viral.</p>
              <p>Yang Kee-ho, a professor of Japanese Studies at Sungkonghoe
University in Seoul, said the two sides were far apart.</p>
              <p>""But it could get even worse if the asset sale of Japanese
firms is materialised, so it's good to listen and talk to the
Japanese to see if they can find a new, creative way out.""</p>
              <p/>
              <p>'COMFORT WOMEN'</p>
              <p>Reminders of Japan's rule are inflammatory for both sides,
but the issue of ""comfort women,"" a Japanese euphemism for
women, many of them Korean, forced into wartime brothels, is
particularly contentious.</p>
              <p>Many surviving South Korean victims demand Japan's formal
apology and compensation.</p>
              <p>Japan says the matter of compensation for the women was
settled under the 1965 treaty.</p>
              <p>In 2015, South Korea and Japan reached a settlement under
which Tokyo issued an official apology and provided 1 billion
yen ($9.23 million) to a fund to help the victims.</p>
              <p>Taking office two years later, South Korean President Moon
Jae-in dissolved the fund, effectively scrapping the agreement,
a move that analysts said convinced Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe the South Korean leader was deceitful.</p>
              <p>Tokyo wants Seoul to remove a statue near the Japanese
embassy in Seoul commemorating the comfort women, and another
next to the Japanese consulate in Busan.</p>
              <p>Some comfort women victims continue their weekly protest in
front of the embassy.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>ISLETS</p>
              <p>The two countries also have a territorial dispute which
flared this month when South Korea flew fighter jets over a set
of remote islands marking its Armed Forces Day.</p>
              <p>The windswept volcanic islets, known as Dokdo in Korea and
Takeshima in Japan, are controlled by Seoul with a small band of
coast guards although also claimed by Tokyo.</p>
              <p>The cluster sit astride fertile fishing grounds and possibly
enormous deposits of natural gas hydrate that could be worth
billions of dollars, experts say.</p>
              <p>The territorial feud is emotional for Koreans, who say the
islands, recorded as part of their territory since 512, were the
first land seized by Japan as part of forcible occupation of the
peninsula.</p>
              <p>Japan argues the islands were never part of Korea and it had
established sovereignty by the mid-17th century as a stop-over
point for its fishermen.</p>
              <p>Seoul rejects Tokyo's proposal to refer the dispute to the
International Court of Justice.</p>
              <p>In 2017, Japan complained after Moon served visiting U.S.
President Donald Trump a dish called ""Dokdo shrimp,"" and invited
a comfort women survivor to a banquet for Trump.</p>

labourers' right to reparation ceased under a 1965 treaty
normalising diplomatic ties.
Relations deteriorated when Japan restricted exports of
high-tech material to South Korea in July, while a group of
former labourers requested a court order to forcibly liquidate
Mitsubishi assets for compensation.
Thousands of South Koreans protested condemning what they
called Japan's ""economic invasion.""
Last week, a commercial by Japanese clothing brand Uniqlo
stirred a backlash in South Korea as mocking victims of forced
labour and comfort women, prompting a parody video featuring a
90-year-old woman who worked for Mitsubishi to go viral.
Yang Kee-ho, a professor of Japanese Studies at Sungkonghoe
University in Seoul, said the two sides were far apart.
""But it could get even worse if the asset sale of Japanese
firms is materialised, so it's good to listen and talk to the
Japanese to see if they can find a new, creative way out.""

'COMFORT WOMEN'
Reminders of Japan's rule are inflammatory for both sides,
but the issue of ""comfort women,"" a Japanese euphemism for
women, many of them Korean, forced into wartime brothels, is
particularly contentious.
Many surviving South Korean victims demand Japan's formal
apology and compensation.
Japan says the matter of compensation for the women was
settled under the 1965 treaty.
In 2015, South Korea and Japan reached a settlement under
which Tokyo issued an official apology and provided 1 billion
yen ($9.23 million) to a fund to help the victims.
Taking office two years later, South Korean President Moon
Jae-in dissolved the fund, effectively scrapping the agreement,
a move that analysts said convinced Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe the South Korean leader was deceitful.
Tokyo wants Seoul to remove a statue near the Japanese
embassy in Seoul commemorating the comfort women, and another
next to the Japanese consulate in Busan.
Some comfort women victims continue their weekly protest in
front of the embassy.

ISLETS
The two countries also have a territorial dispute which
flared this month when South Korea flew fighter jets over a set
of remote islands marking its Armed Forces Day.
The windswept volcanic islets, known as Dokdo in Korea and
Takeshima in Japan, are controlled by Seoul with a small band of
coast guards although also claimed by Tokyo.
The cluster sit astride fertile fishing grounds and possibly
enormous deposits of natural gas hydrate that could be worth
billions of dollars, experts say.
The territorial feud is emotional for Koreans, who say the
islands, recorded as part of their territory since 512, were the
first land seized by Japan as part of forcible occupation of the
peninsula.
Japan argues the islands were never part of Korea and it had
established sovereignty by the mid-17th century as a stop-over
point for its fishermen.
Seoul rejects Tokyo's proposal to refer the dispute to the
International Court of Justice.
In 2017, Japan complained after Moon served visiting U.S.
President Donald Trump a dish called ""Dokdo shrimp,"" and invited
a comfort women survivor to a banquet for Trump.

MUMBAI, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Cases of human

South Asia, with India at its center, is one of the

              <p>MACHAKOS, Kenya, Oct 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - For
the past two years, Beatrice Ndavi, a 56-year-old farmer in
central Kenya, has received vouchers for good-quality seeds and
fertiliser, as well as training to improve her yields.</p>
              <p>The support is offered on credit as part of an insurance
scheme that provides security for the farmer’s loan by paying it
down if her harvest is damaged by extreme weather.</p>
              <p>Ndavi, a mother of six from Masii village in Machakos
County, explained that in the past, farmers ended up taking out
cash loans to cover their needs in an emergency, which they then
struggled to pay back.</p>
              <p>But under the Risk-Contingent Credit (RCC) scheme she is
part of, it has become easier for her to keep going, even if the
weather is bad, she said.</p>
              <p>“I get the right farm inputs - quality seeds and fertilisers
on time - and I’m not worried about how to repay the loan as
it’s insured,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>

              <p>RAIN-BASED PAYOUTS</p>
              <p>Millions of rural households in Kenya rely on agriculture
for their income, but a warming climate is bringing more intense
and frequent droughts, disrupting production.</p>
              <p>Recurring losses due to sometimes consecutive years of
drought, coupled with the high cost of certified seeds and other
inputs, have made poor farmers reluctant to invest in their
land, organisations working on the RCC project found.</p>
              <p>Apurba Shee, lead researcher with the Natural Resources
Institute at Britain’s University of Greenwich, said the credit
scheme differs from traditional insurance as it takes into
account rainfall patterns as they unfold rather than paying out
only when harvests fail.</p>
              <p>Remote-sensing satellite technology is used to track
rainfall in real-time, and if the average drops below a set
threshold in any 21-day period during the growing season, it
triggers digital payouts that cover farmers’ loans.</p>
              <p>The system allows for multiple payments spread throughout
the season, as rain volumes fluctuate, Shee said.</p>
              <p>The RCC programme aims to tackle both credit constraints and
risks linked to drought, he said in an interview.</p>
              <p>“We are getting clear positive indications in term of
increased farming investments (and) farmers going back to
farming more often, even after a devastating drought,” he added.</p>
              <p>According to a 2018 survey, nearly 1,200 farmers in Machakos
had enrolled in the RCC scheme, with 40% taking out insured
loans to buy farm inputs.</p>
              <p>The average amount they received was 8,500 Kenyan shillings
($82), compared with 6,000 shillings ($58) for traditional
loans.</p>
              <p>In the neighbouring county of Embu, about 800 farmers are
taking part in the U.S. government-backed project.</p>
              <p>Shee said the RCC scheme had now proved itself to be
commercially viable and had the potential to be expanded to
other parts of Kenya and semi-arid regions across southern and
eastern Africa, as well as along the borders of the Sahara.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>DWINDLING CAPITAL</p>
              <p>Before joining the scheme, Ndavi struggled when persistent
drought brought water shortages, as she – like many other
farmers in Kenya’s drylands – relies on regular rainfall to keep
her crops in good health.</p>
              <p>In 2017, she lost five acres of planted maize worth $100
because of drought.</p>
              <p>“I didn’t have any other means of recovering my losses, so I
went back to my savings to farm again in the following season,”
she said, pointing to her land, which was again dry and bare.</p>
              <p>More severe droughts are leaving many farmers increasingly
vulnerable and with less capital to invest in their business,
said Sarfraz Shah, project manager at Nairobi-based APA
Insurance, which underwrites the RCC scheme.</p>
              <p>Some farmers are wary of borrowing money, and in other
cases, financial institutions are reluctant to lend to them,
viewing them as high risk – which feeds into a vicious circle of
lower productivity, he noted.</p>

              <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday again waded into America's fraught racial history by labelling the impeachment inquiry against him a ""lynching"" - language that conjured memories of decades of killings of thousands of black people - drawing swift bipartisan condemnation.</p>
              <p>""All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN!"" Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to the impeachment inquiry in the Democratic-led House of Representatives focusing on his request that Ukraine investigate a domestic political rival, Democrat Joe Biden.</p>
              <p>Lynching refers to the murder of thousands of Americans, most of them black, between the 1880s and 1960s, as African-Americans struggled for their rights as U.S. citizens in the aftermath of the Civil War in which Southern states fought in vain to maintain black slavery.</p>
              <p>""The president should not compare a constitutionally mandated impeachment inquiry to such a dangerous and dark chapter of American history. It's irresponsible for him to do so, and I hope that he will apologise,"" said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, who is black.</p>
              <p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said, ""Given the history in our country, I would not compare this to a lynching. That was an unfortunate choice of words."" McConnell added that he viewed the House inquiry as ""an unfair process"" that is denying Trump ""procedural safeguards.""</p>
              <p>Democrats and other critics have previously accused Trump of stoking racial divisions while trying to appeal to his largely white core of conservative Republican voters, noting his comment in 2017 that there were ""very fine people on both sides"" at a rally by white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia in which a counter-protester was killed.</p>
              <p>Some Republican allies agreed with Trump's use of the word lynching.</p>
              <p>""It shows a lot of things about our national media. When it's about Trump, who cares about the process, as long as you get him. So, yeah, this is a lynching in every sense. This is un-American,"" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, whose home state of South Carolina has a large black population, told reporters.</p>
              <p>Trump has a long and controversial history on race including decades-old allegations of discrimination in his family's real estate business. He also championed the death penalty for five black and Latino teens wrongly accused of raping a white woman in 1989 in New York's Central Park, used an expletive to describe African countries in 2018, and singled out black athletes for criticism after they failed to stand for the national anthem while protesting racial inequity.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>'HISTORICAL TRAGEDIES'</p>
              <p>Trump's lynching comment was immediately condemned by critics as unbecoming of a president.</p>
              <p>""For him to say something like that was disgusting, reflects his insensitivity toward the historical tragedies of this country,"" said Representative Barbara Lee, who said she was not surprised or shocked by Trump's comments but ""just very, very disappointed.""</p>
              <p>""For Trump to characterize a legal impeachment inquiry as a lynching shows a complete disrespect for the thousands of Black people lynched - murdered - throughout our nation's history in acts of racism and hatred,"" said Karen Baynes-Dunning, interim president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which advocates for equal opportunity and fights bigotry. </p>
              <p>The impeachment inquiry is focused on Trump's request during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that he investigate a domestic political rival, former vice president Joe Biden. Biden is a leading contender to become the Democratic 2020 presidential nominee to run against Trump.</p>

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday again waded into America's fraught racial history by labelling the impeachment inquiry against him a ""lynching"" - language that conjured memories of decades of killings of thousands of black people - drawing swift bipartisan condemnation.
""All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN!"" Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to the impeachment inquiry in the Democratic-led House of Representatives focusing on his request that Ukraine investigate a domestic political rival, Democrat Joe Biden.
Lynching refers to the murder of thousands of Americans, most of them black, between the 1880s and 1960s, as African-Americans struggled for their rights as U.S. citizens in the aftermath of the Civil War in which Southern states fought in vain to maintain black slavery.
""The president should not compare a constitutionally mandated impeachment inquiry to such a dangerous and dark chapter of American history. It's irresponsible for him to do so, and I hope that he will apologise,"" said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, who is black.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said, ""Given the history in our country, I would not compare this to a lynching. That was an unfortunate choice of words."" McConnell added that he viewed the House inquiry as ""an unfair process"" that is denying Trump ""procedural safeguards.""
Democrats and other critics have previously accused Trump of stoking racial divisions while trying to appeal to his largely white core of conservative Republican voters, noting his comment in 2017 that there were ""very fine people on both sides"" at a rally by white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia in which a counter-protester was killed.
Some Republican allies agreed with Trump's use of the word lynching.
""It shows a lot of things about our national media. When it's about Trump, who cares about the process, as long as you get him. So, yeah, this is a lynching in every sense. This is un-American,"" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, whose home state of South Carolina has a large black population, told reporters.
Trump has a long and controversial history on race including decades-old allegations of discrimination in his family's real estate business. He also championed the death penalty for five black and Latino teens wrongly accused of raping a white woman in 1989 in New York's Central Park, used an expletive to describe African countries in 2018, and singled out black athletes for criticism after they failed to stand for the national anthem while protesting racial inequity.

'HISTORICAL TRAGEDIES'
Trump's lynching comment was immediately condemned by critics as unbecoming of a president.
""For him to say something like that was disgusting, reflects his insensitivity toward the historical tragedies of this country,"" said Representative Barbara Lee, who said she was not surprised or shocked by Trump's comments but ""just very, very disappointed.""
""For Trump to characterize a legal impeachment inquiry as a lynching shows a complete disrespect for the thousands of Black people lynched - murdered - throughout our nation's history in acts of racism and hatred,"" said Karen Baynes-Dunning, interim president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which advocates for equal opportunity and fights bigotry. 
The impeachment inquiry is focused on Trump's request during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that he investigate a domestic political rival, former vice president Joe Biden. Biden is a leading contender to become the Democratic 2020 presidential nominee to run against Trump.
Biden said on Twitter that Trump's use of the word was ""abhorrent"" and ""despicable.""
Biden, however, said in 1998 the impeachment of President Bill Clinton could be seen as a ""partisan lynching."" Biden apologised in a tweet late on Tuesday, saying it ""wasn't the right word to use and I’m sorry about that.""

WASHINGTON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump
on Tuesday again waded into America's fraught racial history by

MEXICO CITY, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When
Mexican entrepreneur Alvaro Velasco came up with the idea of a
digital app that provided earthquake warnings he was convinced
he had the ideal business that could be a commercial success
while helping society.
But door after door slammed as he tried to get money and
legal assistance from both the government and the private sector
to set up his social enterprise, SkyAlert - and he was not alone
in this challenge.
Mexico was listed on Tuesday as the worst country for social
entrepreneurs out of the world's 45 biggest economies in the
second global poll of experts by the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
It fell 15 places from the inaugural survey three years ago.
Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela were the other
Latin American countries in the poll, coming 26th, 38th, 39th
and 40th respectively in the ranking of 43 nations. Iran and
Saudi Arabia were dropped due to difficulties polling there.
""In Mexico City, there's been a brutal slowdown in the

""With few resources, with zero possibility of accessing
public funds ... and always fighting local and federal
governments that don't want you to operate, it becomes mission
impossible, and that's what we have to fight against in Mexico.""
The poll of about 900 social enterprise experts, conducted
with Deutsche Bank, found Mexico saw the biggest slump of any
country when respondents were asked if social entrepreneurship
was gaining momentum there. It dropped 32 places to number 40.
Mexico was one of the worst two countries when it came to
public understanding the work of social entrepreneurs, leaving
them struggling to sell to the public, and also in the bottom
two countries when it came to support from government policy.
The findings echoed a 2017 study from the Failure Institute,
a nonprofit organization that investigates why various
endeavours fail, that found more than 80% of Mexican social
enterprises had a life expectancy of less than three years.
The biggest causes of failure, the study found, were a lack
of resources and infrastructure and public and private
resistance to investing in social enterprises.

LACK OF UNDERSTANDING
""There's only a small minority of people who see social
entrepreneurship as a significant or important value
proposition,"" said Alejandro Morales Garcia, from the Eugenio
Garza Laguera Entrepreneurship Institute at Mexico's Tecnologico
de Monterrey university.
""It's difficult for projects to flourish or be born or to
continue to develop if we keep thinking in this same way.""
The country of about 130 million people fared badly in most
of 12 indicators used to measure political economic, regulatory
and cultural factors impacting social entrepreneurs. Topping the
poll were Canada, Australia and France.
Mexico also came third last when looking at where women were
playing a leading role as social entrepreneurs, rating just

              <p>KARACHI/LONDON, Oct 22  (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From
turning organic waste into fertiliser to sharing farm equipment,
new businesses seeking to address social problems in Pakistan
have made the South Asian nation one of the best performers in
the second global poll on social entrepreneurs.</p>
              <p>Pakistan was one of the three countries, along with
Australia and the Netherlands, whose overall ranking improved
the most since the first Thomson Reuters Foundation experts'
poll on the best countries for social entrepreneurs in 2016.</p>
              <p>The country advanced 18 spots to place 14th among the
world's 45 biggest economies, seen as a nation where social
entrepreneurs can make a living and attract good staff.</p>
              <p>""The landscape has changed tremendously in terms of openness
and receptivity for entrepreneurship,"" said Shaista Ayesha, 39,
who heads product development at SEED Ventures, a business
incubator based in Karachi.</p>
              <p>""Almost all universities have business incubation centres
that are either working with the public or the private sectors
to support home-grown enterprises.""</p>
              <p>Interest of young people in the sector was seen as spurring
growth, with a youth boom giving Pakistan one of the world's
youngest populations, a trend seen continuing until at least
2050, according to the United Nations Development Programme.</p>
              <p>About two-thirds of Pakistan's 210 million people are
younger than 30 with 29% percent aged between 15 and 29.</p>
              <p>This new generation of young Pakistanis was not only aware
of the political and socio-economic challenges faced by the
country, but has also found social networks to voice opinions.</p>
              <p>""Social issues no longer go unnoticed, and there is a
general increase in public eagerness, particularly among the
youth, to step up and bring positive change,"" Ayesha said.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>YOUTH MOVEMENT</p>
              <p>As the government struggles to find solutions for a nation
affected by poverty, water scarcity, climate change and lack of
sanitation, social startups are emerging to fill the gaps.</p>
              <p>Pakistani banker and economist Ishrat Hussain, adviser to
Prime Minister Imran Khan for Institutional Reforms and
Austerity, said he was not surprised by the poll results.</p>
              <p>Hussain cited microfinance institutions, business schools
and the digital economy for supporting entrepreneurship.</p>
              <p>""There are higher education institutions that have set up
entrepreneur centres which are arming people who are not
formally trained with business tools, especially women, farmers,
youth ... people otherwise neglected,"" he added.</p>
              <p>Most social enterprises in Pakistan are headed by young
entrepreneurs. About one-fifth are led by women compared with 5%
of mainstream companies, according to British Council research.</p>
              <p>Neelum Hassan, a 26-year-old industrial design graduate,
founded her social enterprise, Aerosync, in 2016 to design and
manufacture products with a social or environmental impact.</p>
              <p>Her first project is a design for a lightweight,
solar-powered mobile cart with foldable counter that converts
into a shelter for the thousands of street vendors in Pakistani
cities.</p>
              <p>Street and mobile vending lets people set up businesses with
minimal outlay and no paperwork, but they have increasingly
faced crackdown from authorities for not having licences.</p>
              <p>Her plan would provide a ready-made package with registered
carts, allocated space and affordable lease schemes.</p>
              <p>Hassan won the ""Most Promising Woman-Led Business"" award at
the Global Clean tech program set up by the United Nations
Industrial Development Organization and the $15,000 prize money
went towards developing a small manufacturing line, she said.</p>
              <p>""I personally won't call this a success story because the
journey has just begun,"" Hassan said.</p>
              <p>Improved access to local and international investment - with
Pakistan jumping 24 places to 9th place in the latest poll,
conducted in partnership with Deutsche Bank - has helped many
young social entrepreneurs get their ideas off the ground.</p>
              <p>Support group Impact Link was launched in December 2018 with
backing from the Scottish government to support a small number
of social enterprises moving beyond the early growth stages.</p>
              <p>In the latest round of funding, it gave 4,000 pounds
($4,946) each to five startups to scale up their business.</p>
              <p>These included TrashIt, which is working on collecting
organic waste from food vendors and turn it into fertiliser, and
Good Earth, which is behind sharing platforms for farm
equipment, often beyond the means of poor farmers.</p>
              <p>SEED Ventures co-founder Faraz Khan said a proposed law to
provide a legal definition for social enterprises would also
help attract more foreign investors to Pakistan once approved.</p>
              <p>""Once under a legal umbrella, they will be able to attract
global impact capital and philanthropic funding,"" said Khan.</p>
              <p>Ahad Nazir, head of the Centre for Private Sector Engagement
at Pakistan's Sustainable Development Policy Institute, said the
law would give certainty to investors and social entrepreneurs.</p>

KARACHI/LONDON, Oct 22  (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From
turning organic waste into fertiliser to sharing farm equipment,
new businesses seeking to address social problems in Pakistan
have made the South Asian nation one of the best performers in
the second global poll on social entrepreneurs.
Pakistan was one of the three countries, along with
Australia and the Netherlands, whose overall ranking improved
the most since the first Thomson Reuters Foundation experts'
poll on the best countries for social entrepreneurs in 2016.
The country advanced 18 spots to place 14th among the
world's 45 biggest economies, seen as a nation where social
entrepreneurs can make a living and attract good staff.
""The landscape has changed tremendously in terms of openness
and receptivity for entrepreneurship,"" said Shaista Ayesha, 39,
who heads product development at SEED Ventures, a business
incubator based in Karachi.
""Almost all universities have business incubation centres
that are either working with the public or the private sectors
to support home-grown enterprises.""
Interest of young people in the sector was seen as spurring
growth, with a youth boom giving Pakistan one of the world's
youngest populations, a trend seen continuing until at least
2050, according to the United Nations Development Programme.
About two-thirds of Pakistan's 210 million people are
younger than 30 with 29% percent aged between 15 and 29.
This new generation of young Pakistanis was not only aware
of the political and socio-economic challenges faced by the
country, but has also found social networks to voice opinions.
""Social issues no longer go unnoticed, and there is a
general increase in public eagerness, particularly among the
youth, to step up and bring positive change,"" Ayesha said.

YOUTH MOVEMENT
As the government struggles to find solutions for a nation
affected by poverty, water scarcity, climate change and lack of
sanitation, social startups are emerging to fill the gaps.
Pakistani banker and economist Ishrat Hussain, adviser to
Prime Minister Imran Khan for Institutional Reforms and
Austerity, said he was not surprised by the poll results.
Hussain cited microfinance institutions, business schools
and the digital economy for supporting entrepreneurship.
""There are higher education institutions that have set up
entrepreneur centres which are arming people who are not
formally trained with business tools, especially women, farmers,
youth ... people otherwise neglected,"" he added.
Most social enterprises in Pakistan are headed by young
entrepreneurs. About one-fifth are led by women compared with 5%
of mainstream companies, according to British Council research.
Neelum Hassan, a 26-year-old industrial design graduate,
founded her social enterprise, Aerosync, in 2016 to design and
manufacture products with a social or environmental impact.
Her first project is a design for a lightweight,
solar-powered mobile cart with foldable counter that converts
into a shelter for the thousands of street vendors in Pakistani
cities.
Street and mobile vending lets people set up businesses with
minimal outlay and no paperwork, but they have increasingly
faced crackdown from authorities for not having licences.
Her plan would provide a ready-made package with registered
carts, allocated space and affordable lease schemes.
Hassan won the ""Most Promising Woman-Led Business"" award at
the Global Clean tech program set up by the United Nations
Industrial Development Organization and the $15,000 prize money
went towards developing a small manufacturing line, she said.
""I personally won't call this a success story because the
journey has just begun,"" Hassan said.
Improved access to local and international investment - with
Pakistan jumping 24 places to 9th place in the latest poll,
conducted in partnership with Deutsche Bank - has helped many
young social entrepreneurs get their ideas off the ground.
Support group Impact Link was launched in December 2018 with
backing from the Scottish government to support a small number
of social enterprises moving beyond the early growth stages.
In the latest round of funding, it gave 4,000 pounds
($4,946) each to five startups to scale up their business.
These included TrashIt, which is working on collecting
organic waste from food vendors and turn it into fertiliser, and
Good Earth, which is behind sharing platforms for farm
equipment, often beyond the means of poor farmers.
SEED Ventures co-founder Faraz Khan said a proposed law to
provide a legal definition for social enterprises would also
help attract more foreign investors to Pakistan once approved.
""Once under a legal umbrella, they will be able to attract
global impact capital and philanthropic funding,"" said Khan.
Ahad Nazir, head of the Centre for Private Sector Engagement
at Pakistan's Sustainable Development Policy Institute, said the
law would give certainty to investors and social entrepreneurs.
""Some of the companies claiming to be social enterprises are
not actually social enterprises, and some companies that are
actually social enterprises don't know they are,"" he said.
Ishrat Hussain, however, disagreed.
""I think it's a bit premature to gag these entrepreneurs
with a legal framework. Let them bloom and flourish, and when
they reach maturity, then rein them,"" he said. ""You should not
suppress their creativity at this stage.""

leaders in Indonesia must get involved with young people to
tackle the trash problem that blights the nation's islands and
surrounding seas, a leading Asian youth environmental activist
said on Monday.</p>
              <p>The archipelago of 17,000 islands is the world's second
biggest contributor of plastic pollutants in the oceans,
according to government officials.</p>
              <p>A fast-growing population and a coastline with many cities
has created a ""perfect storm"" for trash finding its way into the

collection and recycling failing to keep pace with development.</p>

KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 21 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Local
leaders in Indonesia must get involved with young people to
tackle the trash problem that blights the nation's islands and
surrounding seas, a leading Asian youth environmental activist
said on Monday.
The archipelago of 17,000 islands is the world's second
biggest contributor of plastic pollutants in the oceans,
according to government officials.
A fast-growing population and a coastline with many cities
has created a ""perfect storm"" for trash finding its way into the
surrounding seas, according to green groups, with garbage
collection and recycling failing to keep pace with development.
""Youths can drive bigger and faster changes,"" said
Swietenia Puspa Lestari, 24, an environmental engineer who
co-founded the Indonesian youth-led non-government organisation
Divers Clean Action (DCA) https://www.diverscleanaction.org in
2015.
""They have no hidden agenda and only care about the
future,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from
Jakarta having been inspired by teenage activist Greta
Thunberg's angry speech at the United Nations last month.
Lestari, a keen scuba diver, helped to set up DCA when she
was a student at Bandung Institute of Technology and the group
now has about 1,500 volunteers in Indonesia and across Southeast
Asia, working with communities and organising youth workshops.
DCA also initiated the #NoStrawMovement online campaign in
2017 to ban single-use plastics, which was taken up by hundreds
of restaurants, and the group teamed up with fashion giant H&M
so collected marine debris is recycled and used in some clothes.
Lestari is increasingly being recognised for her work,
listed as one of the BBC's 100 inspiring and influential women
for 2019 and taking part in Norway this week in a youth
leadership summit run by non-profit Sustainable Ocean Alliance.
But to make progress Lestari said it was critical that local
and not just national leaders get more involved to tackle the
growing problem of waste - and often it was young people who had
the solutions.
The rubbish problem on the resort island of Bali was so bad
two years ago that officials declared a ""garbage emergency"",
while Jakarta pledged up to $1 billion a year to reduce marine
plastic debris by 70 percent by 2025.
This national action plan encouraged local governments to
find solutions for their areas and regions, and this opportunity
should be seized on, Lestari said.
""For the national government, they need to invest in more
recycling facilities on islands other than Java because many of
our volunteers collect waste but ... it is too costly to

H ousing millions of refugees returning to Afghanistan is one of
the biggest challenges facing the country as it attempts to meet
the basic needs of its people amid the world's longest-running
war, a senior government official said.</p>
              <p>There are more than 2.6 million registered refugees in the
world from Afghanistan, the highest number after Syria,
according to the United Nations. In addition, more than two
million have been internally displaced by the ongoing conflict.</p>

back, or returning of their own accord and struggling to find
housing in the cities where they often settle for jobs, said
Abdul Baqi Popal, the deputy minister of municipalities.</p>
              <p>The government has made affordable housing a priority, with
the aim of giving 1 million ""Occupancy Certificates"" for
informal settlers over the next three years, he said.</p>
              <p>""The aim is to formalise informal settlements, which are
largely on government land. But the government has low financial

slow,"" he said on the sidelines of a U.N. urban forum in Penang.</p>
              <p>""The certificate will give them the right to occupy the plot
without eviction for five years, after which if they meet
certain conditions, they can get a land title that gives them
full ownership,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p>All certificates will be in the name of both the husband and

              <p>Four decades of war have uprooted millions of Afghans from

Afghanistan since 2014, according to U.N. estimates.</p>

              <p>Under the City For All programme launched in 2016, the
Afghan government has committed to urban planning and land
management, including surveying and registering properties in
urban areas.</p>
              <p>The government is using mapping tools to collect land data
and, under a presidential decree issued last year, is
registering properties and informal settlements for Occupancy
Certificates, said Popal, who oversees 165 municipalities.</p>
              <p>More than 70% of homes in urban areas are informal or

              <p>LONDON, Oct 21  (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A landmark
legal challenge will be filed in Britain on Monday over cotton
imports from Uzbekistan in a case lawyers say could pave the way
to stop slave-made goods entering the European Union (EU).</p>
              <p>The legal action says imports of Uzbek cotton into EU
nations are unlawful because the bloc has applied preferential
tariffs without investigating the human rights situation in
Uzbekistan or its compliance with international law obligations.</p>
              <p>This violates EU rules and means many of its 28 members are
facilitating a trade in cotton produced by a state-driven system
of forced labour, according to the Uzbek-German Forum for Human
Rights (UGF), the civil society group behind the case.</p>
              <p>The Central Asian nation has acknowledged the use of forced
labour in its cotton harvest, and vowed to ""eradicate"" the
problem.</p>
              <p>The lawyers behind the case hope it will succeed in London's
Administrative Court - part of the High Court of Justice - and
be referred to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg where
any decision or ruling would be legally binding across the EU.</p>
              <p>Such action could range from forcing the EU to conduct due
diligence into Uzbekistan's cotton production to a ruling that
would effectively stop the entry into the bloc of goods known to
be produced by forced labour, said lawyers supporting the case.</p>
              <p>""This approach is unprecedented ... it aims to disrupt the
unhindered importation of forced labour cotton into Europe,""
said Gerry Liston, legal officer at Global Legal Action Network
(GLAN), a Britain-based charity helping UGF with the case.</p>
              <p>""If successful, it would have implications for all sorts of
goods tainted with forced labour (in the EU),"" he added.</p>
              <p>Liston pointed to a 2016 U.S. law that allows customs
officials to seize and detain goods suspected to have been made
by slave labour, and said a positive ruling could drive the EU's
legislative bodies to adopt similar measures affecting the bloc.</p>
              <p>The case comes at a vital time for EU-Uzbek relations as the
bloc is negotiating an agreement with Uzbekistan that would see
preferential tariffs extended to its textile exports, he added.</p>

she said, adding that the EC followed the U.N. International
Labour Organization (ILO) on the application of work standards.</p>
              <p>The ILO last year said 93% of those who worked in the 2018

mobile phone towers were just for calls and messages? They can
also help predict rainfall, telecoms experts said on Friday, a
potential game-changer for farmers in developing countries such
as India and Sri Lanka.</p>
              <p>Many emerging economies cannot afford sophisticated
forecasting tools such as ground-based radar and rain-gauge
networks, making it harder to predict seasonal rains that are
the lifeblood for farmers in many Asian countries.</p>

HYDERABAD, Oct 18 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Thought
mobile phone towers were just for calls and messages? They can
also help predict rainfall, telecoms experts said on Friday, a
potential game-changer for farmers in developing countries such
as India and Sri Lanka.
Many emerging economies cannot afford sophisticated
forecasting tools such as ground-based radar and rain-gauge
networks, making it harder to predict seasonal rains that are
the lifeblood for farmers in many Asian countries.
""Weather information - that's the number one need farmers
have more than anything else,"" said Daniele Tricarico, who works
on agritech at the mobile communications industry body GSMA.
""We are trying to use very useful mobile operator data to
provide better, enhanced services to small-holder farmers for

disturbed when it rains, providing data that enables local

BOGOTA, Oct 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Mothers of
young men and teenagers who say their sons were murdered by
government soldiers during Colombia's conflict begged a tribunal
for answers on Thursday as the country investigates human rights
atrocities committed during its war.
Colombia's five-decade war pitted leftist rebels against
government forces and right-wing paramilitary groups. Some
200,000 people were killed, 7.7 million displaced and 60,000
listed as missing, according to government figures.
A 2016 peace accord between the government and
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels established
a Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) tribunal which is
investigating war crimes.
Its aims including uncovering what happened during
Colombia's war and prosecuting FARC leaders and state military
officials accused of human rights abuses.
Wearing T-shirts with photos of their missing sons as
handmade quilts and posters commemorating the dead lined the
Bogota courtroom's walls, a dozen mothers and other relatives
described their long quest for justice before three judges.
""I want to know the truth about what happened to my son, who
did it and why. Who took him away?,"" said Beatriz Mendez, whose
19-year-old son and a nephew disappeared in 2004.
""I've been waiting for more than a decade for justice. There

The rights abuses are among the so-called ""false positives""
scandal that rocked Colombia in the late 2000s, when army units

Some officers accused of involvement have appeared before
the JEP tribunal, while dozens of soldiers and officers have

Colombia's attorney general's office is also investigating
nearly 2,300 similar cases of alleged extra-judicial killings
when victims, some as young as 16, were often lured from their
homes in Bogota's slum neighborhoods by the promise of work.
""Our duty is to reach those who are the most responsible,""
judge Catalina Diaz told the hearing.

REDUCED JAILED SENTENCES
The peace accord allows for former rebels and others who
come forward to receive reduced sentences and avoid prison if
they confess to crimes and repay victims, including any land and
property seizures.
Those admitting to war crimes will be sentenced to five to
eight years of ""alternative punishment"". What that will mean in
reality remains unclear, but options could include community
service, restricted freedom or house arrest.
Those who neither confess nor accept responsibility and are
found guilty could face up to 20 years in jail.

              <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A new
green fund being set up by Indonesia should prioritise
protecting its rainforests and creating a carbon trading
programme to help the country meet its goals to curb climate
change, environmentalists and officials said.</p>
              <p>Indonesia's environment ministry last week launched an
agency to manage funds to repair environmental damage and
educate communities to prevent further harm.</p>
              <p>The agency is due to begin operating at the start of 2020
with initial finance of about 2 trillion rupiah ($141 million)
from land restoration payments and fines the state collects from
environmental crime cases, as well as money from foreign donors.</p>
              <p>The agency could potentially raise up to 800 trillion rupiah
($56.5 billion) for environmental projects, Indonesia's finance
minister told reporters.</p>
              <p>Vegard Kaale, Norway's ambassador to Indonesia, told the
Thomson Reuters Foundation the new fund could help Indonesia
meet its national commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement to
tackle climate change, ""if used efficiently"".</p>
              <p>""The income from reduced deforestation could benefit
provinces and communities that are both producing emissions
reductions and preserving biodiversity and are most at risk of
the impacts of climate change,"" he said, referring to
compensation the Southeast Asian nation may receive for keeping
its forests standing.</p>
              <p>Home to the world's third-largest tropical forests,
Indonesia is also the biggest producer of palm oil, which many
green groups blame for the clearing of forests for plantations.</p>
              <p>About a decade ago, Norway signed a $1-billion deal with
Indonesia to protect its forests and this year made the first
payment for cutting emissions after deforestation rates fell.</p>
              <p>Kaale said Indonesia could potentially increase its climate
financing from many sources, including the private sector,
international donors and multilateral organisations.</p>
              <p>""Having a public, government-run fund established in
Indonesia offers an opportunity to donors to more directly and
efficiently support the policies of the government,"" he said.</p>
              <p>The fund could also strengthen coordination and boost action
on green investment and climate change across Indonesia's
government, as ten ministries are involved, he added.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>MEETING PARIS PLEDGES</p>
              <p>Jakarta now aims to prepare regulation that will allow the
country to launch a carbon trading programme.</p>
              <p>Under such schemes, entities wanting to reduce their
planet-warming emissions buy credits from projects that keep
greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere, such as protecting
forests that store carbon.</p>
              <p>""This should be one of the core businesses of the fund,""
said Daniel Murdiyarso and Michael Brady, scientists at the
Center for International Forestry Research.</p>
              <p>""A carbon trading programme is important for Indonesia to
fulfil and receive performance-based payments for forest
protection and to cover its nationally determined contributions
under the Paris Agreement,"" they added.</p>
              <p>Like many Asian countries, Indonesia is experiencing a rise
in urbanisation, population and economic growth and is
scrambling to find ways to increase its electric power capacity,
with coal plants set to play a major role.</p>
              <p>But under the Paris accord, Indonesia committed to reducing
its greenhouse gas emissions by 29 percent by 2030, a target
that could rise to 41 percent with international support.</p>
              <p>Annisa Rahmawati, a campaigner at Greenpeace Indonesia,
said that without a dramatic reduction in the use of fossil
fuels and an end to deforestation, the country would not be able
to meet its Paris accord commitments and play its part in
limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7F).</p>
              <p>""Financing forest and peatland protection should therefore
be a priority for the fund,"" she said.</p>
              <p>Ensuring the new fund and its investments are properly
monitored and transparent will be vital to ensure the success of
its projects and to attract finance, green groups said.</p>
              <p>Rahmawati said there was a danger the fund would prioritise
projects whose main focus was to expand the economy, such as
large dams and infrastructure in conservation areas, rather than
tackling climate impacts and reducing emissions.</p>
              <p>""Providing financing is one thing, but ensuring that the
funded activities address the most relevant problems to prevent
and mitigate climate change is essential,"" she said.

green fund being set up by Indonesia should prioritise
protecting its rainforests and creating a carbon trading
programme to help the country meet its goals to curb climate
change, environmentalists and officials said.
Indonesia's environment ministry last week launched an
agency to manage funds to repair environmental damage and
educate communities to prevent further harm.
The agency is due to begin operating at the start of 2020
with initial finance of about 2 trillion rupiah ($141 million)
from land restoration payments and fines the state collects from
environmental crime cases, as well as money from foreign donors.
The agency could potentially raise up to 800 trillion rupiah
($56.5 billion) for environmental projects, Indonesia's finance
minister told reporters.
Vegard Kaale, Norway's ambassador to Indonesia, told the
Thomson Reuters Foundation the new fund could help Indonesia
meet its national commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement to
tackle climate change, ""if used efficiently"".
""The income from reduced deforestation could benefit
provinces and communities that are both producing emissions
reductions and preserving biodiversity and are most at risk of
the impacts of climate change,"" he said, referring to
compensation the Southeast Asian nation may receive for keeping
its forests standing.
Home to the world's third-largest tropical forests,
Indonesia is also the biggest producer of palm oil, which many
green groups blame for the clearing of forests for plantations.
About a decade ago, Norway signed a $1-billion deal with
Indonesia to protect its forests and this year made the first
payment for cutting emissions after deforestation rates fell.
Kaale said Indonesia could potentially increase its climate
financing from many sources, including the private sector,
international donors and multilateral organisations.
""Having a public, government-run fund established in
Indonesia offers an opportunity to donors to more directly and
efficiently support the policies of the government,"" he said.
The fund could also strengthen coordination and boost action
on green investment and climate change across Indonesia's
government, as ten ministries are involved, he added.

MEETING PARIS PLEDGES
Jakarta now aims to prepare regulation that will allow the
country to launch a carbon trading programme.
Under such schemes, entities wanting to reduce their
planet-warming emissions buy credits from projects that keep
greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere, such as protecting
forests that store carbon.
""This should be one of the core businesses of the fund,""
said Daniel Murdiyarso and Michael Brady, scientists at the
Center for International Forestry Research.
""A carbon trading programme is important for Indonesia to
fulfil and receive performance-based payments for forest
protection and to cover its nationally determined contributions
under the Paris Agreement,"" they added.
Like many Asian countries, Indonesia is experiencing a rise
in urbanisation, population and economic growth and is
scrambling to find ways to increase its electric power capacity,
with coal plants set to play a major role.
But under the Paris accord, Indonesia committed to reducing
its greenhouse gas emissions by 29 percent by 2030, a target
that could rise to 41 percent with international support.
Annisa Rahmawati, a campaigner at Greenpeace Indonesia,
said that without a dramatic reduction in the use of fossil
fuels and an end to deforestation, the country would not be able
to meet its Paris accord commitments and play its part in
limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7F).
""Financing forest and peatland protection should therefore
be a priority for the fund,"" she said.
Ensuring the new fund and its investments are properly
monitored and transparent will be vital to ensure the success of
its projects and to attract finance, green groups said.
Rahmawati said there was a danger the fund would prioritise
projects whose main focus was to expand the economy, such as
large dams and infrastructure in conservation areas, rather than
tackling climate impacts and reducing emissions.
""Providing financing is one thing, but ensuring that the
funded activities address the most relevant problems to prevent
and mitigate climate change is essential,"" she said.

schools in Africa is key to lowering the fast-growing

with 4.6 births per woman compared to the global average of 2.9,
according to a United Nations report released in June.</p>

said Sachs, who advised governments and the United Nations on

              <p>U.N. figures show that 130 million girls of school age
globally are not in school, and the world's highest rate of
teenage pregnancy — 143 per 1,000 girls aged 15–19 years — is in

impossible to end hunger and it is impossible to end poverty,""
said Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development

NEW DELHI, Oct 16 (Reuters) - India's Supreme Court on
Wednesday ordered an end to hearings in a long-running dispute
between Hindus and Muslims over a place of worship, laying the
ground for a verdict that could lead to further divisions.
Hindus believe that the site in the northern town of Ayodhya
is the birthplace of god-king Lord Ram and want a temple built
on the ruins of a mosque that was torn down by zealots in 1992,
triggering riots across the country.
Muslims want the 16th century mosque be rebuilt and leaders
from the two sides have been arguing over the matter for
decades.
""Enough is enough,"" Supreme Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said
in a packed courtroom in New Delhi, sitting alongside four other
judges.
""Hearing in this matter is going to be completed today,"" he
said.
Hindu groups tied to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling
party have been agitating for a temple at the site, saying a
temple existed there before Muslim invaders destroyed it and
built the mosque.
Lawyers, journalists and a couple of saffron-robed Hindu
monks jostled for space in the courtroom as both sides made
their case over who the land should be given to, quoting
historical information.
""The mosque was a symbol of slavery as it was built by a
Mughal invader Babar by demolishing a holy temple,"" said Sharad
Sharma, spokesman of the Vishva Hindu Parishad, a Hindu

alternatives to keep teenagers off the streets and away from
gangs who - often with the nicest clothes, motorbikes and money
in their pockets from drug dealing - can easily lure them in.</p>
              <p>About 3,000 young people in Medellin belong to gangs or risk
being recruited, according to the mayor's office. Often armed
and fighting over turf, neighbourhood gangs control drug

people aged between 10 and 28 taking part in the ""Parceros"" or

              <p>It offers support to go back to school, get job interviews
and set up small businesses, from textile to DJ companies, as
well as activities that help young people make friends across
the invisible borders that divide gang territory.</p>
              <p>""While the violence is always there, the project showed me
there's something else around the corner, another way. It opened
up my eyes,"" said Rodriguez, who works in a motorbike factory
after social workers sent his CV to employers across the city.</p>
              <p>""What I liked the most is that it taught me if you were
violent, you felt powerful on the street. But I learned that a
person is powerful when they have a peace of mind inside and are
happy with themselves.""</p>
              <p>The programme includes yoga, breathing exercises to deal
with anger, and challenges including diving into a swimming pool

              <p>LONDON, Oct 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Driverless
transport, underground shops, heated bike paths, armed street
patrols – this is not the setting for a dystopian novel but it
could soon be the city where you live.</p>
              <p>As the world sees the biggest wave of urban growth in
history – with almost 70% of its population expected to be
living in urban areas by 2050, up from 56% today – the task of
making cities greener and safer is becoming more urgent.</p>
              <p>That cities are attracting more people is nothing new, noted
urban specialist Philipp Rode, who runs London-based research
centre LSE Cities.</p>
              <p>""People move to cities to live and work because they're a
solution: they significantly reduce the amount of movement and
space required to do anything,"" he told the Thomson Reuters
Foundation.</p>
              <p>""But the absolute increase in population, the millions
coming into cities - that's unprecedented.""</p>
              <p>The shift is creating significant challenges for many cities
already at risk from worsening climate change and rising
inequality, with the race on to house swelling populations and
tackle homelessness.</p>
              <p>To cope with these modern-day pressures, cities around the
world are trying to become ""smarter"" - from moving storage and
retail facilities underground, to using data and technology to
improve security, healthcare and mobility.</p>
              <p>Many cities, particularly in poorer nations, are also facing
large and expanding slum populations which lack basic services,
fueling inequality, and, in some cases, violence.</p>
              <p>Mandy Pienaar, a 43-year-old media executive from
Johannesburg, knows this only too well.</p>
              <p>One winter evening, as she and her boyfriend drove home from
the movies in the South African city, two armed assailants
hijacked their car, stripped them of their clothing and stole
their bank cards before the couple managed to escape.</p>
              <p>""It was quite shocking because there were a lot of people
walking past who kind of looked at me as if this was an everyday
occurrence, to see a stripped woman sitting in a slum area in
the cold,"" Pienaar recalled.</p>
              <p>Their ordeal illustrates the ""false sense of security"" that
comes with living as they do in a gated community, she said.</p>
              <p>""We have bars on every window, huge dogs, electric fencing
... to us that's normal. We've become desensitised.""</p>
              <p>Community-led projects like ""vuvuzela patrols"" aim to tackle
such violence, with groups of men armed with plastic trumpets
escorting women on their daily commutes in Johannesburg.</p>
              <p>But security is not the only worry on urban planners' minds.</p>
              <p>From the small U.S. city of Duluth to the metropolis of Hong
Kong, cities are thrashing out ways to reinvent themselves and
revamp how their residents live, move and consume.</p>
              <p>""Mobility, water, waste: the world's greatest challenges are
solved in cities,"" said Tiina Kaho, head of the Helsinki
Metropolitan Smart &amp; Clean Foundation, a coalition of
businesses, researchers and state officials.</p>
              <p>Yet as the world transforms rapidly, ""cities will have to
innovate like never before"", she said.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>GOING UNDERGROUND</p>
              <p>From Singapore to sub-Saharan Africa, cities are running out
of space to house swelling populations.</p>
              <p>""It's a scarce resource,"" said Rode. ""Using that space in
the most efficient way possible is crucial.""</p>
              <p>Historically cities have tended to grow outwards rather than

Institute and Yale University in January.</p>
              <p>But, if uncontrolled, such expansion can make it challenging
to deliver basic services, with trips to school or the doctor
becoming longer, for example. At the same time, it eats into
farmland and can threaten green areas and biodiversity.</p>
              <p>To be sustainable, cities will need to temper their sprawl
with efforts to increase density, researchers said.</p>
              <p>In Britain, for example, the government announced plans to
build hundreds of thousands of new rural homes along its 'Green
Belt' - protected areas in the English countryside.</p>
              <p>For other cities, increasing density will mean putting more
facilities below ground - not just subway networks and utilities
but commercial, retail and storage facilities too.</p>
              <p>In Hong Kong, known for its towering skyscrapers and wooded
hills, there is a particular urgency to maximise use of
underground space, with home and land prices among the world's
highest.</p>
              <p>The government has vowed to free more space for housing
through measures like building artificial islands.</p>
              <p>It is also looking to use underground spaces for waste
treatment, data centres, water reservoirs, power stations,
crematoriums and sports facilities.</p>
              <p>""For the city, it results in more efficient use of space ...
and avoids the conflicts of traffic and weather disruptions
above ground,"" said Mark Wallace, director of infrastructure at
Arup, a consultancy that studied underground space in Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>Other cities have also gone underground, with Finland's
capital Helsinki moving sports facilities and emergency shelters
below the surface. Canada's Montreal, meanwhile, has a wide
pedestrian network of shops and hotels beneath its streets.</p>
              <p>In December billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk unveiled a
1.14-mile (1.8 km) tunnel in the Los Angeles area that was dug
with new fast, low-cost technology, as a first step to
developing a high-speed subterranean network for vehicles.</p>
              <p>While excavating and building underground is more expensive,
there are savings in maintenance and land costs, Wallace said.</p>
              <p>But underground living is no replacement for better land-use
planning, researchers warned, while residents worry construction
and access to buried facilities will eat into green space above.</p>
              <p>Euan Mills, urban design and planning lead at Future Cities
Catapult, a UK-funded innovation centre, said cities should
""accommodate nature, but not at the expense of density"".</p>
              <p>For him, the answer lies in building skywards.</p>
              <p>""Human bodies need daylight, so going underground won't
work,"" he said.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>SAFE CITIES</p>
              <p>As cities seek space to grow, they must also consider how
their development affects social equality, said Rode of LSE
Cities.</p>
              <p>""In fast-expanding cities the differences between rich and
poor increase,"" he said.</p>
              <p>Neighbourhoods tend to display income disparities, leaving
some with better access to services, and leading to what Rode
called ""anti-urban gestures"" such as gated communities.</p>
              <p>In South Africa, the legacy of apartheid-era city planning
and rapid urban population growth have contributed to making it
the most unequal country by income, according to the World Bank.</p>
              <p>South Africa's cities remain for the most part racially
divided more than 20 years after the end of apartheid, under
which millions of black people were forcibly removed from
white-only urban areas to live in crowded townships and
homelands, with buffer zones separating the races.</p>
              <p>Those patterns of inequality can stoke grievances, according
to urban analysts, with South Africa – which has one of the
world's highest murder rates – in July deploying the army to
quell a surge in violence in gang-infested parts of Cape Town.</p>
              <p>That has led to a proliferation of private security firms,
such as safety start-up Aura, which created a mobile platform
allowing customers to access a network of armed emergency
services.</p>
              <p>""The police are stretched thin,"" said Warren Myers, founder
of Aura, which has received about 25 panic alerts a day from its
70,000 users since its launch in 2017.</p>
              <p>""We need to marry as many different technologies as possible
- CCTV, facial recognition, data collection, WhatsApp groups -
to better protect South Africans,"" he added.</p>
              <p>But private security is hardly sufficient to tackle crime,
analysts warned, as realised by cities in Latin America where
drug-fuelled murder rates are among the world's highest.</p>
              <p>After decades of heavy-handed police tactics in cities in
Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela and parts of Central
America, new methods of tackling crime are gaining currency,
with a stronger focus on social development projects.</p>
              <p>In Colombia's second city of Medellin, this approach has
focused on urban renewal in slums: once-neglected shanty
districts now boast landscaped parks, open-air gyms, schools,
playgrounds and community halls where youth orchestras play.</p>
              <p>""Sustained investment in deprived areas ... combined with
increased community policing and recreational alternatives, like
after-school programmes, have seemed to turn the dial in
reducing homicide rates,"" said Robert Muggah, co-founder of the
Igarape Institute, a Brazil-based think-tank.</p>
              <p>After the death of cocaine drug-lord Pablo Escobar in 1993,
Medellin's murder rate plunged more than 90% from 266 per
100,000 people in 1991 to 19 per 100,000 in 2018.</p>
              <p>Medellin resident Johan Rodriguez, 25, decided to retire
from gang life after taking part in a six-month programme to
keep vulnerable people away from crime.</p>
              <p>The ""Parceros"" (""Mates"") project, launched last year by city
hall, helps teenagers go back to school, get job interviews and
set up small businesses, from textiles to DJing.</p>
              <p>""While the violence is always there, the project showed me
there's something else around the corner, another way,"" said
Rodriguez, who now works in a motorbike factory after social
workers sent out his CV to employers across the city.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>CLIMATE HAVENS</p>
              <p>Yet as record numbers of people move into cities, some urban
areas are facing uncertainty over the future as climate change
brings worsening threats, from extreme heat to flooding.</p>
              <p>One fifth of the world's major cities will experience
unprecedented climate conditions by 2050, such as more intense
dry and monsoon seasons, according to the Crowther Lab, a
Swiss-based research group.</p>
              <p>Researchers predict that as wild weather becomes more
frequent, it could force millions of people to move out of
harm's way, with some unable to return.</p>
              <p>From Indonesia's sinking capital of Jakarta to the Middle
East's sweltering cities, that poses a new kind of challenge for
urban planners, Rode said.</p>
              <p>""Cities have faced numerous events like wars or earthquakes
when populations had to be evacuated, but the idea had always
been to return and rebuild,"" he said.</p>
              <p>In response to the threats, some U.S. cities - such as
Minnesota's Duluth - are studying efforts to become top
destinations for Americans abandoning parts of the country that
may one day be made inhospitable by climate change.</p>
              <p>Angel Dobrow, 59, who works for a small firm that supports
farmers, and her husband have already made the move to lakefront
Duluth, leaving their longtime home in another part of Minnesota
in 2017.</p>
              <p>""As a person concerned with climate change, being near
freshwater and having a little bit of land to grow food and grow
herbs was critical for me,"" said Dobrow, sitting in her lush
garden in the northern city.</p>
              <p>Duluth, located by the world's largest freshwater lake, may
not seem the most obvious choice as a haven for climate
migrants.</p>
              <p>With its frigid winters, the metropolis is often ranked as
one of the coldest cities in the United States.</p>
              <p>But Sandy Hoff, the president and owner of local real estate
development firm F.I. Salter, said a changing climate could spur
a property boom that would ""no doubt"" propel his company in ways
unseen since his grandfather acquired it 90 years ago.</p>
              <p>Dobrow said when summer heat and humidity burden other areas
of Minnesota, Duluth's lakefront breezes ""feel like air
conditioning"".</p>
              <p>But some fear an influx of new residents could exacerbate a
housing crisis in a city where few new homes have been built.</p>
              <p>Joel Kilgour, who chairs Duluth's Affordable Housing
Coalition and volunteers at housing non-profit Loaves and
Fishes, said the city's homeless are forced to seek rooms at the
charity as they cannot afford rising rents.</p>
              <p>""If we as a community can't solve that, there's no way that
we're going to be able to handle an influx of climate refugees
in an equitable manner,"" Kilgour said.</p>
              <p>Potential climate refuge cities may also struggle to build
costly infrastructure, such as water treatment plants and energy
utilities, without a sufficient tax base ahead of time to pay
for them, researchers warned.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>SMART CITIES?</p>
              <p>To try to thrive amid rapid urbanisation and worsening
climate change threats, many cities around the world are trying
to become ""smarter"".</p>
              <p>From heated bike paths to melt snow in Toronto to high-tech
sensors that detect when Barcelona's bins need emptying,
governments are pooling resources from citizens and businesses
to make cities more efficient, sustainable and livable.</p>
              <p>Many of those efforts focus on improving mobility in cities,
with urban planners looking at innovative ways to cut both
traffic and climate-warming emissions.</p>
              <p>Dubai - which, according to the Roads and Transport
Authority (RTA), has more than one vehicle for every two people
- is experimenting with driverless mobility pods that aim to
combine the comfort of ride-hailing services like Uber with the
efficiency and capacity of buses.</p>
              <p>The cube-shaped vehicles, built by U.S.-based NEXT Future
Transportation Inc., can carry up to 10 people each and dock
together when in motion, allowing passengers to move from one
unit to the other using the front and rear doors.</p>
              <p>The vehicles – which should enter mass production at the end
of 2020 – are designed to pick up single users at home, then
pool people going in the same direction inside one module, as
other pods are released to collect more passengers.</p>
              <p>""It's like a relay race,"" said founder Tommaso Gecchelin.</p>
              <p>Rode of LSE Cities said it was important one inefficient car
system should not be replaced with another, adding autonomous
vehicles should carry as many passengers as possible.</p>
              <p>Allowing private self-driving cars could result in empty
vehicles ""just driving around waiting for their owners"", taking
up public space needlessly, he warned.</p>
              <p>Other major smart city initiatives have run into delays or
unexpected problems, sparking criticism.</p>
              <p>Kenya's planned Konza Technopolis – a new $14.5 billion city
to be built about 60 km (37 miles) southeast of crowded Nairobi
– has fallen behind schedule on its goal of accommodating 20,000
people by 2020, according to Nairobi-based entrepreneurs and
analysts.</p>
              <p>Dubbed the Silicon Savannah, Konza aims to become a modern
tech hub but the first building has yet to be completed due to
red tape and a lack of funding, critics noted.</p>
              <p>Lavasa - the first city in India's $7.5 billion plan to turn
100 urban centres into Smart Cities by 2020 - has suffered from
design issues, and ignored the needs of poor and marginalised
groups, planners and rights groups have said.</p>
              <p>""Urban planners, not cities, are the ones who need to get
smarter,"" said Mills of Future Cities Catapult, calling for more
investment in data collection and training of city planners.</p>
              <p>""Google knows more about our cities than planning
departments do.""</p>
              <p/>
              <p>SLOWER CITIES?</p>
              <p>Even as some cities become smarter and more efficient, calls
also are mounting to slow the frantic pace of urban life.</p>
              <p>Efforts range from the literal – with many cities pushing
for lower speed limits on their roads — to the imaginative,
including art installations to promote mindfulness.</p>
              <p>On a recent ""sound walk"" in the English town of Reading, a
dozen residents, including a retired historian and teenage
students, strolled silently through parks, graveyards and
bookstores.</p>
              <p>Led by sound artist Richard Bentley, the group uploaded
photos and audio recordings from their phones to Hush City, an
app that maps quiet areas in cities.</p>
              <p>With noise pollution the most common cause of environmental
complaints in Europe, according to the European Commission, and
more people crowding into urban areas, Bentley expects peace and
quiet could become a ""commodified luxury"".</p>
              <p>Historically, poorer groups lower down the social ladder
have had to live in noisy parts of cities while those with more
means could move away, he said.</p>
              <p>""It's incredibly important to keep these quiet spaces and to
be aware of their possible disappearance,"" he added.</p>
              <p>Some places are jumping on the livability bandwagon through
Cittaslow, which means ""slow city"" in Italian.</p>
              <p>The global network of more than 260 cities grades its
members according to factors such as sustainable infrastructure,
promotion of local economies, fairness and ""good living"".</p>
              <p>South Korean member Jeonju, a city of about 650,000 people,
has planted millions of trees and runs monthly car-free zones
since joining in 2016, Mayor Seung-Su Kim said by email.</p>
              <p>Pier Giorgio Oliveti, the network's secretary general, said
the approach could be a ""vaccine"" for the ills of modernity.</p>
              <p>But Mills of Future Cities Catapult argued that ""one of the
most exciting things about cities is how alive they are"".</p>
              <p>""I don't think we should be slowing them down,"" he added.</p>
              <p>Now, more than ever, urban planners and government should
""reflect on what cities are for"", advised LSE Cities' Rode.</p>
              <p>""Why are cities such attractive places for living and
working? Because they bring people together to enjoy public
life,"" he said.</p>
              <p>""That real, physical experience needs to be preserved.""

            "		"By Zoe Tabary
LONDON, Oct 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Driverless
transport, underground shops, heated bike paths, armed street
patrols – this is not the setting for a dystopian novel but it
could soon be the city where you live.
As the world sees the biggest wave of urban growth in
history – with almost 70% of its population expected to be
living in urban areas by 2050, up from 56% today – the task of
making cities greener and safer is becoming more urgent.
That cities are attracting more people is nothing new, noted
urban specialist Philipp Rode, who runs London-based research
centre LSE Cities.
""People move to cities to live and work because they're a
solution: they significantly reduce the amount of movement and
space required to do anything,"" he told the Thomson Reuters
Foundation.
""But the absolute increase in population, the millions
coming into cities - that's unprecedented.""
The shift is creating significant challenges for many cities
already at risk from worsening climate change and rising
inequality, with the race on to house swelling populations and
tackle homelessness.
To cope with these modern-day pressures, cities around the
world are trying to become ""smarter"" - from moving storage and
retail facilities underground, to using data and technology to
improve security, healthcare and mobility.
Many cities, particularly in poorer nations, are also facing
large and expanding slum populations which lack basic services,
fueling inequality, and, in some cases, violence.
Mandy Pienaar, a 43-year-old media executive from
Johannesburg, knows this only too well.
One winter evening, as she and her boyfriend drove home from
the movies in the South African city, two armed assailants
hijacked their car, stripped them of their clothing and stole
their bank cards before the couple managed to escape.
""It was quite shocking because there were a lot of people
walking past who kind of looked at me as if this was an everyday
occurrence, to see a stripped woman sitting in a slum area in
the cold,"" Pienaar recalled.
Their ordeal illustrates the ""false sense of security"" that
comes with living as they do in a gated community, she said.
""We have bars on every window, huge dogs, electric fencing
... to us that's normal. We've become desensitised.""
Community-led projects like ""vuvuzela patrols"" aim to tackle
such violence, with groups of men armed with plastic trumpets
escorting women on their daily commutes in Johannesburg.
But security is not the only worry on urban planners' minds.
From the small U.S. city of Duluth to the metropolis of Hong
Kong, cities are thrashing out ways to reinvent themselves and
revamp how their residents live, move and consume.
""Mobility, water, waste: the world's greatest challenges are
solved in cities,"" said Tiina Kaho, head of the Helsinki
Metropolitan Smart & Clean Foundation, a coalition of
businesses, researchers and state officials.
Yet as the world transforms rapidly, ""cities will have to
innovate like never before"", she said.

GOING UNDERGROUND
From Singapore to sub-Saharan Africa, cities are running out
of space to house swelling populations.
""It's a scarce resource,"" said Rode. ""Using that space in
the most efficient way possible is crucial.""
Historically cities have tended to grow outwards rather than
upwards, according to a report published by the World Resources
Institute and Yale University in January.
But, if uncontrolled, such expansion can make it challenging
to deliver basic services, with trips to school or the doctor
becoming longer, for example. At the same time, it eats into
farmland and can threaten green areas and biodiversity.
To be sustainable, cities will need to temper their sprawl
with efforts to increase density, researchers said.
In Britain, for example, the government announced plans to
build hundreds of thousands of new rural homes along its 'Green
Belt' - protected areas in the English countryside.
For other cities, increasing density will mean putting more
facilities below ground - not just subway networks and utilities
but commercial, retail and storage facilities too.
In Hong Kong, known for its towering skyscrapers and wooded
hills, there is a particular urgency to maximise use of
underground space, with home and land prices among the world's
highest.
The government has vowed to free more space for housing
through measures like building artificial islands.
It is also looking to use underground spaces for waste
treatment, data centres, water reservoirs, power stations,
crematoriums and sports facilities.
""For the city, it results in more efficient use of space ...
and avoids the conflicts of traffic and weather disruptions
above ground,"" said Mark Wallace, director of infrastructure at
Arup, a consultancy that studied underground space in Hong Kong.
Other cities have also gone underground, with Finland's
capital Helsinki moving sports facilities and emergency shelters
below the surface. Canada's Montreal, meanwhile, has a wide
pedestrian network of shops and hotels beneath its streets.
In December billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk unveiled a
1.14-mile (1.8 km) tunnel in the Los Angeles area that was dug
with new fast, low-cost technology, as a first step to
developing a high-speed subterranean network for vehicles.
While excavating and building underground is more expensive,
there are savings in maintenance and land costs, Wallace said.
But underground living is no replacement for better land-use
planning, researchers warned, while residents worry construction
and access to buried facilities will eat into green space above.
Euan Mills, urban design and planning lead at Future Cities
Catapult, a UK-funded innovation centre, said cities should
""accommodate nature, but not at the expense of density"".
For him, the answer lies in building skywards.
""Human bodies need daylight, so going underground won't
work,"" he said.

SAFE CITIES
As cities seek space to grow, they must also consider how
their development affects social equality, said Rode of LSE
Cities.
""In fast-expanding cities the differences between rich and
poor increase,"" he said.
Neighbourhoods tend to display income disparities, leaving
some with better access to services, and leading to what Rode
called ""anti-urban gestures"" such as gated communities.
In South Africa, the legacy of apartheid-era city planning
and rapid urban population growth have contributed to making it
the most unequal country by income, according to the World Bank.
South Africa's cities remain for the most part racially
divided more than 20 years after the end of apartheid, under
which millions of black people were forcibly removed from
white-only urban areas to live in crowded townships and
homelands, with buffer zones separating the races.
Those patterns of inequality can stoke grievances, according
to urban analysts, with South Africa – which has one of the
world's highest murder rates – in July deploying the army to
quell a surge in violence in gang-infested parts of Cape Town.
That has led to a proliferation of private security firms,
such as safety start-up Aura, which created a mobile platform
allowing customers to access a network of armed emergency

""The police are stretched thin,"" said Warren Myers, founder

70,000 users since its launch in 2017.
""We need to marry as many different technologies as possible

CLIMATE HAVENS
Yet as record numbers of people move into cities, some urban
areas are facing uncertainty over the future as climate change
brings worsening threats, from extreme heat to flooding.
One fifth of the world's major cities will experience
unprecedented climate conditions by 2050, such as more intense

From Indonesia's sinking capital of Jakarta to the Middle

""Cities have faced numerous events like wars or earthquakes

In response to the threats, some U.S. cities - such as
Minnesota's Duluth - are studying efforts to become top

may one day be made inhospitable by climate change.
Angel Dobrow, 59, who works for a small firm that supports

in 2017.
""As a person concerned with climate change, being near

Duluth, located by the world's largest freshwater lake, may
not seem the most obvious choice as a haven for climate
migrants.
With its frigid winters, the metropolis is often ranked as
one of the coldest cities in the United States.
But Sandy Hoff, the president and owner of local real estate
development firm F.I. Salter, said a changing climate could spur
a property boom that would ""no doubt"" propel his company in ways
unseen since his grandfather acquired it 90 years ago.
Dobrow said when summer heat and humidity burden other areas
of Minnesota, Duluth's lakefront breezes ""feel like air

But some fear an influx of new residents could exacerbate a
housing crisis in a city where few new homes have been built.
Joel Kilgour, who chairs Duluth's Affordable Housing

charity as they cannot afford rising rents.
""If we as a community can't solve that, there's no way that
we're going to be able to handle an influx of climate refugees

Potential climate refuge cities may also struggle to build

together when in motion, allowing passengers to move from one
unit to the other using the front and rear doors.
The vehicles – which should enter mass production at the end
of 2020 – are designed to pick up single users at home, then
pool people going in the same direction inside one module, as
other pods are released to collect more passengers.
""It's like a relay race,"" said founder Tommaso Gecchelin.
Rode of LSE Cities said it was important one inefficient car
system should not be replaced with another, adding autonomous
vehicles should carry as many passengers as possible.
Allowing private self-driving cars could result in empty
vehicles ""just driving around waiting for their owners"", taking
up public space needlessly, he warned.
Other major smart city initiatives have run into delays or
unexpected problems, sparking criticism.
Kenya's planned Konza Technopolis – a new $14.5 billion city
to be built about 60 km (37 miles) southeast of crowded Nairobi
– has fallen behind schedule on its goal of accommodating 20,000
people by 2020, according to Nairobi-based entrepreneurs and
analysts.
Dubbed the Silicon Savannah, Konza aims to become a modern
tech hub but the first building has yet to be completed due to
red tape and a lack of funding, critics noted.
Lavasa - the first city in India's $7.5 billion plan to turn
100 urban centres into Smart Cities by 2020 - has suffered from
design issues, and ignored the needs of poor and marginalised
groups, planners and rights groups have said.
""Urban planners, not cities, are the ones who need to get
smarter,"" said Mills of Future Cities Catapult, calling for more
investment in data collection and training of city planners.
""Google knows more about our cities than planning
departments do.""

SLOWER CITIES?
Even as some cities become smarter and more efficient, calls
also are mounting to slow the frantic pace of urban life.
Efforts range from the literal – with many cities pushing
for lower speed limits on their roads — to the imaginative,
including art installations to promote mindfulness.
On a recent ""sound walk"" in the English town of Reading, a
dozen residents, including a retired historian and teenage
students, strolled silently through parks, graveyards and
bookstores.
Led by sound artist Richard Bentley, the group uploaded
photos and audio recordings from their phones to Hush City, an
app that maps quiet areas in cities.
With noise pollution the most common cause of environmental
complaints in Europe, according to the European Commission, and
more people crowding into urban areas, Bentley expects peace and
quiet could become a ""commodified luxury"".
Historically, poorer groups lower down the social ladder
have had to live in noisy parts of cities while those with more
means could move away, he said.
""It's incredibly important to keep these quiet spaces and to
be aware of their possible disappearance,"" he added.
Some places are jumping on the livability bandwagon through
Cittaslow, which means ""slow city"" in Italian.
The global network of more than 260 cities grades its
members according to factors such as sustainable infrastructure,
promotion of local economies, fairness and ""good living"".
South Korean member Jeonju, a city of about 650,000 people,
has planted millions of trees and runs monthly car-free zones
since joining in 2016, Mayor Seung-Su Kim said by email.
Pier Giorgio Oliveti, the network's secretary general, said
the approach could be a ""vaccine"" for the ills of modernity.
But Mills of Future Cities Catapult argued that ""one of the
most exciting things about cities is how alive they are"".
""I don't think we should be slowing them down,"" he added.
Now, more than ever, urban planners and government should
""reflect on what cities are for"", advised LSE Cities' Rode.
""Why are cities such attractive places for living and
working? Because they bring people together to enjoy public
life,"" he said.
""That real, physical experience needs to be preserved.""

              <p>LONDON, Oct 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Women's rights
campaigners on Tuesday marked two years since the #MeToo
campaign against sexual harassment first swept through social
media.</p>
              <p>The global movement has brought down multiple high-profile
figures and sparked wider debates over women's safety, workplace
representation and sexism.</p>
              <p>Here's how #MeToo grew from a grassroots campaign to a
global touchpoint:</p>
              <p>2006: Activist Tarana Burke creates the ""Me Too"" movement to
help sexual assault victims in underprivileged communities in
the United States.</p>
              <p>Oct. 5-8, 2017: Hollywood film mogul Harvey Weinstein is
fired from his production company after being accused of
sexually harassment. Scores of women have since accused him of
sexual misconduct dating back decades, allegations he denies.
Weinstein faces trial for rape in January 2020.</p>
              <p>Oct. 15, 2017: Actor Alyssa Milano urges anyone who has been
sexually assaulted to write ""Me too"" on Twitter, in a post that
prompts a flood of women to share their stories and is hailed as
the start of the mass #MeToo movement.</p>
              <p>Oct. 2017: The movement goes international, with France
seeing a similar online campaign under the hashtag
#BalanceTonPorc.</p>
              <p>Dec. 6, 2017: Time magazine names the ""silence breakers"" who
have spoken out about sexual harassment and assault, as its
Person of the Year.</p>
              <p>Jan. 1, 2018: Hollywood stars help launch a #TimesUp
campaign against sexual harassment. The initiative raises
millions of dollars for a legal fund to help victims of sexual
harassment in the workplace.</p>
              <p>Jan. 9, 2018: Actor Catherine Deneuve and 99 other French
women lead a backlash against #MeToo, saying the campaign
against sexual harassment amounts to ""puritanism"" and is fueled
by a ""hatred of men"".</p>
              <p>Jan. 24, 2018: USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar is
sentenced to up to 175 years in prison for abusing young
gymnasts. Top Olympic gymnast Simone Biles says she was among
his victims.</p>
              <p>April 26, 2018: Comedian Bill Cosby is convicted of drugging
and sexually assaulting a woman, the first such successful
prosecution since the movement started. Cosby is later sentenced
to three to 10 years in jail.</p>
              <p>Sept. 27, 2018: Academic Christine Blasey Ford gives
evidence at a Senate hearing beamed worldwide that U.S. Supreme
Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her.</p>
              <p>Oct. 2018: India's #MeToo movement gathers momentum with a
wave of allegations levelled at media, sports, business and
political figures.</p>
              <p>Oct. 12, 2018: More than 800 high-profile public figures in
entertainment, politics, government, media and academia have

December 2015, according to management consultants Temin and Co.</p>
              <p>Feb. 5, 2019: Pope Francis acknowledges that nuns have been
sexually abused by priests and bishops, with some used as sex
slaves.</p>
              <p>June 21, 2019: The U.N. agency overseeing international
labour standards adopts a new treaty against violence and
harassment in the workplace.</p>
              <p>Feb. to Aug. 2019: Singer R. Kelly, who has faced sex abuse
allegations for more than two decades, is charged in multiple

LONDON, Oct 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Women's rights
campaigners on Tuesday marked two years since the #MeToo
campaign against sexual harassment first swept through social
media.
The global movement has brought down multiple high-profile
figures and sparked wider debates over women's safety, workplace
representation and sexism.
Here's how #MeToo grew from a grassroots campaign to a
global touchpoint:
2006: Activist Tarana Burke creates the ""Me Too"" movement to
help sexual assault victims in underprivileged communities in
the United States.
Oct. 5-8, 2017: Hollywood film mogul Harvey Weinstein is
fired from his production company after being accused of
sexually harassment. Scores of women have since accused him of
sexual misconduct dating back decades, allegations he denies.
Weinstein faces trial for rape in January 2020.
Oct. 15, 2017: Actor Alyssa Milano urges anyone who has been
sexually assaulted to write ""Me too"" on Twitter, in a post that
prompts a flood of women to share their stories and is hailed as
the start of the mass #MeToo movement.
Oct. 2017: The movement goes international, with France
seeing a similar online campaign under the hashtag
#BalanceTonPorc.

harassment in the workplace.
Jan. 9, 2018: Actor Catherine Deneuve and 99 other French
women lead a backlash against #MeToo, saying the campaign
against sexual harassment amounts to ""puritanism"" and is fueled
by a ""hatred of men"".
Jan. 24, 2018: USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar is
sentenced to up to 175 years in prison for abusing young
gymnasts. Top Olympic gymnast Simone Biles says she was among
his victims.
April 26, 2018: Comedian Bill Cosby is convicted of drugging
and sexually assaulting a woman, the first such successful
prosecution since the movement started. Cosby is later sentenced
to three to 10 years in jail.
Sept. 27, 2018: Academic Christine Blasey Ford gives
evidence at a Senate hearing beamed worldwide that U.S. Supreme
Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her.
Oct. 2018: India's #MeToo movement gathers momentum with a
wave of allegations levelled at media, sports, business and
political figures.
Oct. 12, 2018: More than 800 high-profile public figures in
entertainment, politics, government, media and academia have
been accused of sexual misconduct since Cosby's arrest in
December 2015, according to management consultants Temin and Co.
Feb. 5, 2019: Pope Francis acknowledges that nuns have been
sexually abused by priests and bishops, with some used as sex
slaves.

labour standards adopts a new treaty against violence and
harassment in the workplace.
Feb. to Aug. 2019: Singer R. Kelly, who has faced sex abuse
allegations for more than two decades, is charged in multiple
cases in different states for crimes including sexual assault
and sex trafficking. He faces trial in 2020.
July 1, 2019: A rape accusation against a popular Nigerian
pastor prompts women to share their own experiences of abuse.
Nigerian actors have said abuse is also rife in Nollywood, the
country's film industry.
Aug. 10, 2019: Financier Jeffrey Epstein dies by suicide in
a New York jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking
charges.
Sept. 17, 2019: Iceland hosts the first international #MeToo
conference to brainstorm ways to end sexism, harassment and
violence against women.
Oct. 2, 2019: Opera singer Placido Domingo resigns as
general director of LA Opera following multiple sexual
harassment allegations, which he denies.
Oct. 2, 2019: Two years on from the movement's birth, some
of Hollywood's biggest names say #MeToo has raised awareness,
but there is a long way to go.

              <p>NEW DELHI, Oct 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Shoved,
cursed and ridiculed, Nisha's hospital visits were always
stressful as a transgender woman and got worse after she was
diagnosed as HIV-positive.</p>
              <p>But a new app introduced as part of a drive to end an HIV
epidemic in India by 2030 is providing her and the transgender
community better access to doctors, lifesaving drugs - and hope
- although it has raised concerns about digital privacy.</p>
              <p>India has the world's third largest population living with
HIV - 2.1 million people - according to UNAIDS, with recognition
that help is needed in the transgender community where the
prevalence is 3.1% compared to 0.26% among all adults.</p>
              <p>Nisha tested HIV positive last year after earning a living
as a sex worker in New Delhi. On the job, she said, condoms
would often break or she would not use one for more money.</p>
              <p>""That was a bad idea. I ended up with HIV. I felt suicidal
after I found out,"" Nisha, 29, a trans woman who goes by one
name, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p>""It didn't help that going to the hospital was torturous.
People made faces, passed lewd comments ... a doctor even kicked
me out.""</p>
              <p>Despite the Supreme Court recognising India's 2 million
transgender people as a third gender with equal rights in 2014,
they are often kicked out by their families and denied jobs,
education and healthcare, leading them to begging or sex work.</p>
              <p>Trans women like Nisha say they face ""double discrimination""
and the risk of being shunned and abused - first because of
their gender identity and then because of their HIV status.</p>
              <p>But a counselling programme along with a new app is helping
health workers track down HIV-positive transgender people,
monitor their treatment and link them to doctors and
antiretroviral therapy (ART) to suppress the AIDS virus.</p>
              <p>""I have found new strength. I don't feel depressed or
nervous anymore,"" said Nisha, who now begs at traffic lights.</p>
              <p>""The app helps keep me physically healthy and she ensures
I'm mentally and emotionally (healthy),"" she said, pointing to
her outreach worker Samyra, an HIV-positive trans woman.</p>
              <p>The eMpower app - developed by IBM in partnership with India
HIV/AIDS Alliance and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria - monitored more than 1.2 million
people between January 2018 and March 2019.</p>

              <p>'HALF THE BATTLE WON'</p>
              <p>With mobile tablets in hand, HIV-positive transgender

with HIV and counsel them and accompany them to see doctors.</p>
              <p>""I tell them 'I'm like you. I'm HIV-positive and I'm taking
medicines too. You're not alone',"" said Samyra, who works with
Vihaan, a national initiative to expand counselling, outreach
and follow-up programmes to people living with HIV.</p>
              <p>""That makes a huge difference because it's coming from one
of your own. Half of the HIV battle is won when you have someone
to hold your hand along the way.""</p>
              <p>Health experts said transgender focused initiatives like
this and the launch in March of India's first HIV treatment
clinic in Mumbai city run for and by LGBT+ people were pushing
the country towards its target to end the epidemic by 2030.</p>
              <p>But to achieve this target they said it was critical for
patients to stick with ART. Sometimes stigma and side effects
can cause them to drop out of the treatment.</p>
              <p>That is why health workers follow up with clients every few
months and record information on the eMpower app, including
their weight, viral load and CD4 - white blood cells that fight
HIV - and advise them on everything from their diet to safe sex.</p>
              <p>They also note whether a client has faced discrimination,
and arrange for partners and family members to get tested.</p>
              <p>Sonal Mehta, head of India HIV/AIDS Alliance, said the app

              <p>BANGKOK, Oct 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Human
traffickers in Thailand have ignored court orders to compensate
victims in more than 99% of cases in recent years, fuelling
fears that many survivors could be re-trafficked, data obtained
exclusively by the Thomson Reuters Foundation revealed.</p>
              <p>Thai courts have ordered traffickers to pay their victims
more than 130 million baht ($4.3 million) for damages caused in
about 1,335 cases since 2014, according to the latest available
statistics from the Office of the Attorney General.</p>
              <p>But the money was only paid in five cases, with survivors
receiving a total of 5.6 million baht - excluding cases settled
out of court - found data from the government's anti-trafficking
department, obtained via Thailand's freedom of information law.</p>
              <p>Although Thailand has rescued a record-breaking 1,000-plus
trafficking victims this year, campaigners are concerned that
the failure to pay compensation will leave them in fresh danger.</p>
              <p>""It's an important issue that is unfortunately being
neglected,"" said Chonticha Tangworamongkon, a program director
at the Human Rights and Development Foundation, which provides
free legal aid to migrant workers and trafficking victims.</p>
              <p>""This money will enable (victims) to start a new life and
prevent them from being re-trafficked, but the government's role
in assisting victims in pursuing the claims is still not clear.""</p>
              <p>Thailand is considering amending its 1999 anti-money
laundering law to allow offenders' assets seized by the
Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO) to be used to compensate
victims.</p>
              <p>Four public hearings were held this year to discuss the
legal amendment - seized assets are currently state property -
but it is unclear when it will be reviewed by the cabinet.</p>
              <p>Thailand is home to about 610,000 modern slaves - about one
in 113 of its 69 million people - according to the Global
Slavery Index by the rights group Walk Free Foundation.</p>
              <p>The United States called on Thailand in June to increase
compensation to victims in its annual Trafficking in Persons
(TIP) report - which ranked it as a Tier 2 country - meaning it
is making significant efforts to combat the crime.</p>
              <p>Trafficking victims are automatically compensated through a
government fund - which provides living and rehabilitation
expenses and lost wages - but Tangworamongkon said these sums of
money were not sufficient for victims to rebuild their lives.</p>
              <p>While Thai law allows victims to claim compensation from
convicted traffickers, offenders have refused to pay in more
than 1,000 cases - for which there is no legal punishment.</p>
              <p>The law requires the Ministry of Social Development and
Human Security to assist victims in enforcing their compensation
claims, yet anti-trafficking charities and campaigners say it
has failed to ensure that fines are collected from offenders.</p>
              <p>But pursuing claims is a complex process, which involves
tracing offenders' assets and bringing in the Legal Execution
Department - which enforces court orders - to seize them.</p>
              <p>Ratchapon Maneelek, a director at Thailand's

forced to tout to tourists in a backpacker district in Bangkok

              <p>By Tom Allard</p>
              <p>BANGKOK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - He is Asia’s most-wanted man. He
is protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private
jet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night
at a Macau casino.</p>
              <p>Tse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected
of leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate
formed out of an alliance of five of Asia’s triad groups,
according to law enforcement officials. Its members call it
simply “The Company.” Police, in a nod to one of Tse’s
nicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for “Brother Number
Three.”</p>
              <p>The syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of
methamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen
countries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South
Pacific. But meth – a highly addictive drug with devastating
physical and mental effects on long-term users – is its main
business, they say.</p>
              <p>In what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate’s
meth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be
as high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the
cartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a
40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has
expanded at least fourfold in the past five years.</p>
              <p>This unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an
unprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the
prime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously
unreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the
Australian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about
20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far
the biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug
trafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in
the investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar,
China, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan,
while not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the
investigation.</p>
              <p>A document containing AFP profiles of the operation’s top 19
syndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the
leader of the syndicate. According to the document, the
organization has “been connected with or directly involved in at
least 13 cases” of drug trafficking since January 2015. The
document does not provide specific details of the cases.</p>
              <p>A Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the
“Multinational CEO” of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional
government agencies says Tse is “believed to be” the leader of
the Sam Gor syndicate.</p>
              <p>Police have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected
boss of the trafficking group.</p>
              <p>Some investigators say that the scope of the syndicate’s
operation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin
America’s most legendary narco-traffickers. “Tse Chi Lop is in
the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,” said Jeremy
Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC.
“The word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no
doubt it applies here.”</p>
              <p>Reuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to
questions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan’s Ministry
of Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on
investigations.</p>
              <p>During the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific
to uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This
included interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement
officials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence
reports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings
and other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in
Myanmar’s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia’s Golden
Triangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing
drugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited
the Thai compound of one of the syndicate’s alleged drug lords.</p>
              <p>What emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly
transnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the
AFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often
refer to as “T1” - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong,
Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.</p>
              <p>The syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and
sophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin
American cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies
a bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a
more diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels
do, including Japan’s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic
Chinese gangs across Southeast Asia.</p>
              <p>The crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled
outbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police
say. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked
rivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a
united pursuit of gargantuan profits.</p>
              <p>“The crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate
with seamless efficiency,” says one veteran Western anti-drugs
official. “They function like a global corporation.”</p>
              <p>Like most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed,
the investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
              <p>In addition to the contrasts between their drug operations,
there’s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop
and Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed
Mexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine
trafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their
extravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has
been revealed about Tse’s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug
lords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>A TRIP, A TRAP</p>
              <p>Tse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern
China, and grew up during China’s Cultural Revolution. Amid the
bloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group
of imprisoned members of Mao’s Red Guard in the southern city of
Guangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big
Circle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police,
and like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong
Kong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their
criminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.</p>
              <p>In the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong,
Macau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based
in Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling
ring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless
opium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand,
China and Laos meet.</p>
              <p>In 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on
drug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New
York. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into
America, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over
his head.</p>
              <p>Through a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged
for leniency.</p>
              <p>His ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His
12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed.
If freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed
“great sorrow” for his crime, court records show.</p>
              <p>The entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to
nine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional
institution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.</p>
              <p>After he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to
Canada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for
the next four years. It’s unclear when Tse returned to his old
haunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife
registered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company
Ltd, in Hong Kong in 2011.</p>
              <p>Police suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He
“picked up where he left off,” said the senior AFP investigator.
Tse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and
the Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved
irresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his
drug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no
extra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.</p>
              <p>His policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for
business, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011,
AFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and
meth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather
than arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under
surveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely
for more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug
cell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They
wanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.</p>
              <p>The syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other
drug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and
selling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the
syndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the
Melbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police
watched the Australian meet two men.</p>
              <p>One of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted
hair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese
family man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance
showed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal
security. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of
Thai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eight
worked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as
part of his security protocol.</p>
              <p>Tse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts
and five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in
private jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand
for a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt,
according to a member of the task force investigating the
syndicate.</p>
              <p>Tse was a frequent visitor to Asia’s casinos and fond of
betting on horses, especially on English races. “We believe he
lost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the
tables in Macau,” said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.</p>
              <p>As the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected
that the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia
with meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA,
commonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the
Sam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say,
when a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of
white powder strapped to each of his thighs.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>‘ALADDIN’S CAVE OF INTEL’</p>
              <p>Cai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the
airport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It
was the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous,
picking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said
a former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation.
“His hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,” the
commander told Reuters. “Methamphetamine is very toxic.”</p>
              <p>Cai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs
was a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful
tranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. “We were very
fortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,” the
commander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been
monitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police
had no idea who he was.</p>
              <p>Cai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a
“pesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,” according to
Myanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A
friend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father.
Cai’s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for
ketamine at the airport, the commander said.</p>
              <p>Unimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight.
The next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport.
One recognized him from surveillance work he’d been conducting.</p>
              <p>Still, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they
later found on one of his phones might have explained his
silence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least
three assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch
and electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said
one investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy
saying “Loyalty to the Heavens.” The banner was a “triad-related
sign,” he added.</p>
              <p>The tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed
the video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat
because he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a
law enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of
the victim’s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad
members were sending a message about the price of disloyalty,
the officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.</p>
              <p>The torture videos were just one of the items allegedly
found in Cai’s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was
a diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate’s activities, but
sloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones,
police say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media
conversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.</p>
              <p>They were “an Aladdin’s Cave of intel,” said one AFP
commander based in North Asia.</p>
              <p>For at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly
travelled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for
the syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the
Drug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its
investigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip
from an international courier company recording the delivery of
two consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf
Chinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea
packets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had
been cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
              <p>Two days after Cai’s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon
address, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That
evening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon
jetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so,
Myanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but
other than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate,
including couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.</p>
              <p>Then came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery
of photos and videos on Cai’s phones, an AFP investigator based
in Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing
he had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier.
“This one stuck out because it was Canadian,” he recalled. “I
said: ‘Fuck, I know who you are!'”</p>
              <p>It was Tse Chi Lop.</p>
              <p>The Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of
intelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work
on Cai’s phones.</p>
              <p>Australia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime
gangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade,
the AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and
small, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent
described the database, which includes a trove of names,
chemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and
surveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence
on Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.</p>
              <p>The AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai’s
phones with the database. They discovered photos related to
three big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in
China, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators
and Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese
anti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and
addresses in Cai’s phones to other meth busts in China.</p>
              <p>For regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations
upended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by
different crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the
work of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics
agent said they believed Cai was “one of the members of a
mega-syndicate,” which had been involved in multiple “drugs
cases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.”</p>
              <p>Cai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still
in jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking
charges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to
contact Cai’s lawyer.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>METH PARADISE</p>
              <p>During his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing
the country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and
obtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a
bigger vessel in international waters, according to police and
the Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures
of the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where
the meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.</p>
              <p>The police reconstruction of Cai’s dealings in Myanmar led
to another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production
had shifted from China’s southern provinces to Shan State in
Myanmar’s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had
provided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor
ingredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were
smuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in
the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the
freedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.</p>
              <p>Armed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan
State have long controlled large tracts of territory and used
drug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the
military. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar
government with rebel groups over the years has brought relative
calm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to
flourish.</p>
              <p>“Production facilities can be hidden from law enforcement
and other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,”
analyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the
International Crisis Group. “Drug production and profits are now
so vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.”</p>
              <p>The Myanmar government and police did not respond to
questions from Reuters.</p>
              <p>Along the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there
is evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts
a deep ravine known as the “Valley of Death,” where ethnic
Kachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for
decades with Myanmar’s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past
trucks carrying building materials and workers.</p>
              <p>The Kaung Kha militia’s immaculate and expansive new
headquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green
hills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers
away, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved
out of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned
out vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba
tablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine.
When it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more
than 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg
of caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances
used in drug production.</p>
              <p>The Loikan facility was “very likely” to have been the
source of much of the Sam Gor syndicate’s meth, said the
Yangon-based AFP officer.</p>
              <p>“Some militia were involved in the lab,” said Oi Khun, a
communications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia,
in an interview. He paused, then added: “But not with the
knowledge of senior members” of the militia.</p>
              <p>One person in Loikan described how workers from the lab
would come down from the hills. The men, like most of the
villagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the
locals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.</p>
              <p>“I asked them once. ‘Why don’t you bathe?’” the person said.
“They said they did, but there was nothing they could do about
the smell.”</p>
              <p>The rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the
skin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature
stench might reveal their illicit activities. “We all knew,” the
person said. “We just didn’t talk about it. That just brings you
danger.”</p>
              <p>Meth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals,
say Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network’s
couriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the
Asia-Pacific.</p>
              <p>Shan’s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the
world, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told
Reuters. “They can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the
ground and let it dry.”</p>
              <p>The UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth
is worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business
model for meth is “very different” to heroin, said the UNODC’s
Douglas. “Inputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not
needed, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore
far, far higher.”</p>
              <p>The wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in
northeastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a
UNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control
Commission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to
the UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand,
$298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the
Japanese market, that’s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.</p>
              <p>The money the syndicate is making “means that if they lose
ten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,”
said the Chinese counter-narcotics official. “They can afford
failure. It doesn’t matter.”</p>
              <p/>
              <p>‘MONEY, MONEY’</p>
              <p>The analysis of Cai’s phones was continuing to provide
leads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the
pick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with
Myanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at
sea for weeks.</p>
              <p>One of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the
Shun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement
document reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea
when, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a
marine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and
paid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV
Valkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s
and hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea
sickness tablets. According to local media, he didn’t have a
fishing license at the time.</p>
              <p>After buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on
a course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in
the Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the
rendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western
Australian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was
seen “unloading a lot of packages” into a van, the commander
said.</p>
              <p>“We knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of
organized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and
comes back with some gear on it, that it hasn’t just dropped
from the sky in the middle of the ocean.”</p>
              <p>Investigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car
hire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug
traffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say,
that some of Smith’s alleged co-conspirators were members of an
ethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and
Comanchero motorcycle gangs, known as “bikies” in Australia.</p>
              <p>As they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of
crystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor
syndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy
of an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians
reconvened in Perth a month later.</p>
              <p>Bikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and
a self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had
refined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star
hotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police
investigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants,
said the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar &amp; Grill in Perth.
The restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that
included caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.</p>
              <p>On November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again,
this time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the
Andaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth
from Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast
of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the
Indian Ocean.</p>
              <p>The Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.</p>
              <p>When the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in
international waters off the West Australian coast on December
19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting “money, money,”
according to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De
Man’s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith
and his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved
their identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by
the crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.</p>
              <p>The Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of
Geraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The
men unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of
the AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault
weapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty
to importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of
his alleged associates are still on trial.</p>
              <p>Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it
had “worked together with our counterparts on the investigation”
of the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the “substantial
seizure of illicit narcotics” by the Australian authorities in
December 2017. The bureau said it was “aware that Taiwanese
syndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in
(the) Asia-Pacific region,” and was working “collaboratively and
closely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and
cross-border drug trafficking.”</p>
              <p/>
              <p>NIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED</p>
              <p>As the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police
concluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone
a kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the
three biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the
1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The
other two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse’s original triad, and the
Bamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator,
the syndicate’s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that
it “must rival Apple’s.”</p>
              <p>“The syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market
to tap,” said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior
colonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade.
“The power this network possesses is unimaginable.”</p>
              <p>Investigators have had wins. In February last year, police
busted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough
tea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66
was intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than
one tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor
lieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar.
In December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected
syndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.</p>
              <p>Located near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed
compound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used
to experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a
100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to
the back of the property.</p>
              <p>Sue wasn’t there, but property and money from 38 bank
accounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized
during the investigation. Sue is still at large.</p>
              <p>But the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the
wider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal
meth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and
Southeast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in
most countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising
seizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019,
“suggested the supply of the drug had expanded.”</p>
              <p>In the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive
adversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug
motherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product
in shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth
coming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the
syndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This
included deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each
containing about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on
narrow jungle paths.</p>
              <p>Over the years, police have had little success in taking
down Asia’s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders
have been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to
the AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics
kingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than
a short period was in the mid-1970s. That’s when Ng Sik-ho, a
wily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced
to 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium
and morphine, according to court records.</p>
              <p>So far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho’s fate. He is being
tracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say
counter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they
believe he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.</p>

By Tom Allard
BANGKOK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - He is Asia’s most-wanted man. He
is protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private
jet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night
at a Macau casino.
Tse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected
of leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate
formed out of an alliance of five of Asia’s triad groups,
according to law enforcement officials. Its members call it
simply “The Company.” Police, in a nod to one of Tse’s
nicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for “Brother Number
Three.”
The syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of
methamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen
countries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South
Pacific. But meth – a highly addictive drug with devastating
physical and mental effects on long-term users – is its main
business, they say.
In what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate’s
meth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be
as high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the
cartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a
40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has
expanded at least fourfold in the past five years.
This unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an
unprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the
prime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously
unreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the
Australian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about
20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far
the biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug
trafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in
the investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar,
China, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan,
while not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the
investigation.
A document containing AFP profiles of the operation’s top 19
syndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the
leader of the syndicate. According to the document, the
organization has “been connected with or directly involved in at
least 13 cases” of drug trafficking since January 2015. The
document does not provide specific details of the cases.
A Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the
“Multinational CEO” of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional
government agencies says Tse is “believed to be” the leader of
the Sam Gor syndicate.
Police have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected
boss of the trafficking group.
Some investigators say that the scope of the syndicate’s
operation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin
America’s most legendary narco-traffickers. “Tse Chi Lop is in
the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,” said Jeremy
Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC.
“The word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no
doubt it applies here.”
Reuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to
questions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan’s Ministry
of Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on
investigations.
During the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific
to uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This
included interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement
officials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence
reports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings
and other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in
Myanmar’s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia’s Golden
Triangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing
drugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited
the Thai compound of one of the syndicate’s alleged drug lords.
What emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly
transnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the
AFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often
refer to as “T1” - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong,
Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.
The syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and
sophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin
American cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies
a bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a
more diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels
do, including Japan’s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic
Chinese gangs across Southeast Asia.
The crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled
outbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police
say. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked
rivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a
united pursuit of gargantuan profits.
“The crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate
with seamless efficiency,” says one veteran Western anti-drugs
official. “They function like a global corporation.”
Like most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed,
the investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.
In addition to the contrasts between their drug operations,
there’s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop
and Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed
Mexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine
trafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their
extravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has
been revealed about Tse’s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug
lords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.

A TRIP, A TRAP
Tse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern
China, and grew up during China’s Cultural Revolution. Amid the
bloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group
of imprisoned members of Mao’s Red Guard in the southern city of
Guangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big
Circle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police,
and like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong
Kong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their
criminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.
In the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong,
Macau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based
in Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling
ring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless
opium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand,
China and Laos meet.
In 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on
drug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New
York. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into
America, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over
his head.
Through a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged
for leniency.
His ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His
12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed.
If freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed
“great sorrow” for his crime, court records show.
The entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to
nine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional
institution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.
After he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to
Canada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for
the next four years. It’s unclear when Tse returned to his old
haunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife
registered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company
Ltd, in Hong Kong in 2011.
Police suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He
“picked up where he left off,” said the senior AFP investigator.
Tse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and
the Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved
irresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his
drug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no
extra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.
His policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for
business, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011,
AFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and
meth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather
than arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under
surveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely
for more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug
cell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They
wanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.
The syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other
drug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and
selling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the
syndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the
Melbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police
watched the Australian meet two men.
One of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted
hair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese
family man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance
showed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal
security. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of
Thai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eight
worked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as
part of his security protocol.
Tse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts
and five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in
private jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand
for a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt,
according to a member of the task force investigating the
syndicate.
Tse was a frequent visitor to Asia’s casinos and fond of
betting on horses, especially on English races. “We believe he
lost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the
tables in Macau,” said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.
As the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected
that the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia
with meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA,
commonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the
Sam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say,
when a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of
white powder strapped to each of his thighs.

‘ALADDIN’S CAVE OF INTEL’
Cai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the
airport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It
was the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous,
picking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said
a former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation.
“His hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,” the
commander told Reuters. “Methamphetamine is very toxic.”
Cai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs
was a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful
tranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. “We were very
fortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,” the
commander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been
monitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police
had no idea who he was.
Cai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a
“pesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,” according to
Myanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A
friend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father.
Cai’s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for
ketamine at the airport, the commander said.
Unimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight.
The next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport.
One recognized him from surveillance work he’d been conducting.
Still, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they
later found on one of his phones might have explained his
silence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least
three assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch
and electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said
one investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy
saying “Loyalty to the Heavens.” The banner was a “triad-related
sign,” he added.
The tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed
the video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat
because he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a
law enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of
the victim’s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad
members were sending a message about the price of disloyalty,
the officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.
The torture videos were just one of the items allegedly
found in Cai’s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was
a diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate’s activities, but
sloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones,
police say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media
conversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.
They were “an Aladdin’s Cave of intel,” said one AFP
commander based in North Asia.
For at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly
travelled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for
the syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the
Drug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its
investigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip
from an international courier company recording the delivery of
two consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf
Chinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea
packets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had
been cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.
Two days after Cai’s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon
address, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That
evening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon
jetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so,
Myanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but
other than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate,
including couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.
Then came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery
of photos and videos on Cai’s phones, an AFP investigator based
in Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing
he had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier.
“This one stuck out because it was Canadian,” he recalled. “I
said: ‘Fuck, I know who you are!'”
It was Tse Chi Lop.
The Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of
intelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work
on Cai’s phones.
Australia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime
gangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade,
the AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and
small, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent
described the database, which includes a trove of names,
chemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and
surveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence
on Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.
The AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai’s
phones with the database. They discovered photos related to
three big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in
China, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators
and Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese
anti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and
addresses in Cai’s phones to other meth busts in China.
For regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations
upended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by
different crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the
work of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics
agent said they believed Cai was “one of the members of a
mega-syndicate,” which had been involved in multiple “drugs
cases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.”
Cai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still
in jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking
charges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to
contact Cai’s lawyer.

METH PARADISE
During his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing
the country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and
obtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a
bigger vessel in international waters, according to police and
the Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures
of the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where
the meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.
The police reconstruction of Cai’s dealings in Myanmar led
to another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production
had shifted from China’s southern provinces to Shan State in
Myanmar’s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had
provided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor
ingredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were
smuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in
the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the
freedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.
Armed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan
State have long controlled large tracts of territory and used
drug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the
military. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar
government with rebel groups over the years has brought relative
calm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to
flourish.
“Production facilities can be hidden from law enforcement
and other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,”
analyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the
International Crisis Group. “Drug production and profits are now
so vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.”
The Myanmar government and police did not respond to
questions from Reuters.
Along the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there
is evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts
a deep ravine known as the “Valley of Death,” where ethnic
Kachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for
decades with Myanmar’s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past
trucks carrying building materials and workers.
The Kaung Kha militia’s immaculate and expansive new
headquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green
hills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers
away, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved
out of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned
out vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba
tablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine.
When it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more
than 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg
of caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances
used in drug production.
The Loikan facility was “very likely” to have been the
source of much of the Sam Gor syndicate’s meth, said the
Yangon-based AFP officer.
“Some militia were involved in the lab,” said Oi Khun, a
communications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia,
in an interview. He paused, then added: “But not with the
knowledge of senior members” of the militia.
One person in Loikan described how workers from the lab
would come down from the hills. The men, like most of the
villagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the
locals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.
“I asked them once. ‘Why don’t you bathe?’” the person said.
“They said they did, but there was nothing they could do about
the smell.”
The rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the
skin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature
stench might reveal their illicit activities. “We all knew,” the
person said. “We just didn’t talk about it. That just brings you
danger.”
Meth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals,
say Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network’s
couriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the
Asia-Pacific.
Shan’s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the
world, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told
Reuters. “They can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the
ground and let it dry.”
The UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth
is worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business
model for meth is “very different” to heroin, said the UNODC’s
Douglas. “Inputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not
needed, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore
far, far higher.”
The wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in
northeastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a
UNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control
Commission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to
the UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand,
$298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the
Japanese market, that’s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.
The money the syndicate is making “means that if they lose
ten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,”
said the Chinese counter-narcotics official. “They can afford
failure. It doesn’t matter.”

‘MONEY, MONEY’
The analysis of Cai’s phones was continuing to provide
leads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the
pick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with
Myanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at
sea for weeks.
One of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the
Shun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement
document reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea
when, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a
marine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and
paid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV
Valkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s
and hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea
sickness tablets. According to local media, he didn’t have a
fishing license at the time.
After buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on
a course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in
the Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the
rendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western
Australian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was
seen “unloading a lot of packages” into a van, the commander
said.
“We knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of
organized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and
comes back with some gear on it, that it hasn’t just dropped
from the sky in the middle of the ocean.”
Investigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car
hire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug
traffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say,
that some of Smith’s alleged co-conspirators were members of an
ethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and
Comanchero motorcycle gangs, known as “bikies” in Australia.
As they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of
crystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor
syndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy
of an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians
reconvened in Perth a month later.
Bikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and
a self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had
refined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star
hotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police
investigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants,
said the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth.
The restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that
included caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.
On November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again,
this time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the
Andaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth
from Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast
of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the
Indian Ocean.
The Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.
When the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in
international waters off the West Australian coast on December
19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting “money, money,”
according to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De
Man’s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith
and his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved
their identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by
the crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.
The Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of
Geraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The
men unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of
the AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault
weapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty
to importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of
his alleged associates are still on trial.
Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it
had “worked together with our counterparts on the investigation”
of the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the “substantial
seizure of illicit narcotics” by the Australian authorities in
December 2017. The bureau said it was “aware that Taiwanese
syndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in
(the) Asia-Pacific region,” and was working “collaboratively and
closely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and
cross-border drug trafficking.”

NIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED
As the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police
concluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone
a kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the
three biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the
1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The
other two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse’s original triad, and the
Bamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator,
the syndicate’s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that
it “must rival Apple’s.”
“The syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market
to tap,” said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior
colonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade.
“The power this network possesses is unimaginable.”
Investigators have had wins. In February last year, police
busted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough
tea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66
was intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than
one tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor
lieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar.
In December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected
syndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.
Located near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed
compound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used
to experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a
100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to
the back of the property.
Sue wasn’t there, but property and money from 38 bank
accounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized
during the investigation. Sue is still at large.
But the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the
wider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal
meth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and
Southeast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in
most countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising
seizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019,
“suggested the supply of the drug had expanded.”
In the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive
adversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug
motherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product
in shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth
coming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the
syndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This
included deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each
containing about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on
narrow jungle paths.
Over the years, police have had little success in taking
down Asia’s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders
have been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to
the AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics
kingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than
a short period was in the mid-1970s. That’s when Ng Sik-ho, a
wily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced
to 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium
and morphine, according to court records.
So far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho’s fate. He is being
tracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say
counter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they
believe he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.

NAIROBI, Oct 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda will
not impose the death penalty for gay sex, a presidential
spokesman said on Monday, after major aid donors  said they were
monitoring a plan by the African nation to reintroduce a bill
colloquially known as ""Kill the Gays"".

VIOLENCE AND PREJUDICE
When asked why Lokodo had made the statement, Wanyama said:
""Ask him. I don't know where he got this idea from. There is no

Lokodo said the bill - that was nullified five years ago on

Lokodo did not immediately respond to calls and messages
from the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Monday.
Earlier this year, Brunei in Southeast Asia sparked
international outcry over plans to impose the death penalty for
gay sex, backtracking only after intense criticism.
African countries have some of the world's most prohibitive
laws governing homosexuality with same-sex relationships
considered taboo and gay sex deemed a crime across most of the
continent, with punishments ranging from imprisonment to death.
Uganda is seen as one of the most difficult countries in
Africa to be in a sexual minority with members of the LGBT
community facing prejudice in getting jobs, renting housing or
seeking medical care or education.
LGBT+ rights groups report that three gay men and one
transgender woman had been killed in homophobic attacks in
Uganda this year - the latest on Oct. 4 when a gay man was

Rejected by their families and fearful for their lives,
hundreds of LGBT+ Ugandans have fled over the last five years to

Human rights groups said Lokodo's comments would inflame
homophobic attitudes further.

              <p>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Oct 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -
K ellu became pregnant after a Nigerian soldier offered her food
and shelter in exchange for sex. But the destitute teenager -
who lost her family when Boko Haram militants attacked her
village two years earlier - did not want to have the baby.</p>
              <p>After moving to a camp for displaced people in northeastern
Borno state, where she relied on neighbours for food,
18-year-old Kellu wanted an abortion but did not know where to
go - like a growing number of women since the Islamist
insurgency began.</p>
              <p>""If I continue with this pregnancy, it will ruin my life,""
Kellu, who guessed she was about two months pregnant, told the
Thomson Reuters Foundation, sitting on a mat in a building
pock-marked with bullet holes.</p>
              <p>""Everyone will know what I did. They will stigmatise me for
having a baby without a husband. Also, I have no money to take
care of myself. How am I supposed to look after a child?"" asked
Kellu, who declined to publish her real name.</p>
              <p>Nigeria has some of the world's most restrictive abortion
laws, which only allow abortion to save the life of the mother.</p>
              <p>The Johns Hopkins University estimates that 2.7 million
abortions are carried out in Nigeria each year, the majority
performed secretly and in dangerous conditions, with poor,
uneducated women most at risk.</p>
              <p>Health and aid workers say unsafe abortions have surged in
northern Nigeria since the start of the Boko Haram conflict in
2009, which has driven 1.8 million Nigerians from their homes,
according to the United Nations.</p>
              <p>At least 40 women and girls come in for emergency
post-abortion care each month, said Aminu, a senior nurse in a
busy government clinic in Yobe state - west of Borno state -
about three times the average of 10 to 15 a month a decade
earlier.
Nigeria has the fourth highest maternal mortality rate
globally, according to the World Health Organization, with about
100 women and girls dying each day.</p>
              <p>Death rates in the northeast - where clinics and hospitals
have been destroyed as armed groups fight to create an Islamic
caliphate - are the worst in Nigeria, government data shows.</p>
              <p>Women and girls go to pharmacies, vendors of locally made
drugs and older women to terminate pregnancies, using
medication, herbs or tools like sticks, Aminu said.</p>
              <p>Fatima, is was in her 40s, went to an aunt who gave her
herbs that caused a miscarriage in a few hours.</p>
              <p>""It wasn't a choice, I had to end it,"" said Fatima, who
declined to publish her real name, who was raising five children
and four grandchildren in a displaced camp in Borno state.</p>
              <p>""Men say it's immorality. But they are not the ones who have
to give birth and look after the babies. When your children are
telling you they are hungry, how can you have another one?"" she
asked, adding foetuses are often found in the camp's toilets.</p>
              <p>Nigerian officials insist the law is upheld.</p>
              <p>""Regardless of circumstances, abortion is prohibited except
for medical reasons,"" said Ali Grema, deputy director of
emergency medical response in the health ministry in Borno
state. ""It is not allowed for social reasons.""</p>
              <p>TABOO</p>
              <p>With many husbands missing, detained or dead, more women are
having sex outside marriage, aid workers said.</p>
              <p>While some women choose to get into new relationships, the
United Nations has recorded thousands of cases of sexual
violence and transactional sex, particularly by women and girls
who lack food, shelter or money.</p>
              <p>""Many people who are displaced live with hosts who take
advantage of them. If they say no, they may lose their housing,""
said Maryam Aje, head of the African Youth for Peace Development
and Empowerment Foundation, which gives women business grants.</p>
              <p>Pointing to a poster in a Maiduguri camp encouraging women
to space their children, Hadiza - a nurse working in a nearby
clinic - said family planning messages focused on married women
because of conservative attitudes.</p>
              <p>""Women will ask for contraception but they don't want
husbands to know,"" said Hadiza, who declined to publish her real
name. ""(They) come at night, when nobody is around.""</p>
              <p>Hadiza said she often received calls or visits from young
women after working hours, asking for the morning-after pill.</p>
              <p>""It's better to prevent such pregnancies than try and deal
with them when they happen,"" she said.</p>
              <p>Many girls do not even know sex can make them pregnant, said
Lucy Dlama of Women in New Nigeria, which supports rape
survivors with health care.</p>
              <p>""Our culture means it is taboo for parents to discuss sex
education with their daughters,"" said Dlama, who encourages
mothers to teach girls about their bodies. ""They can think it is
stomach pain, give birth and then panic.""</p>
              <p>Aminu, the nurse, said most of his patients needing
post-abortion care were teenagers who tried to abort after
several months because they did not know they were pregnant or
hid it.</p>
              <p>""They do not die if we admit them to hospital,"" he said.
""But there are so many more cases where women and girls take
herbs on their own, do not come to the hospital and die because
they do not want to expose themselves.""</p>
              <p>Pregnancy outside marriage is a taboo, even when it is the
result of rape by soldiers, militias or camp officials.</p>
              <p>""They consider you to be a whore and your child to be a
bastard. You have spoiled your family name,"" Aminu said.</p>
              <p>Another factor is a decades-old U.S. government policy,
known as the global ""gag rule"" and reinstated by President
Donald Trump in 2017, barring clinics that receive federal funds
from talking to patients about abortion.</p>
              <p>""We see young girls and women requesting abortion,"" said one
aid worker who worked to support health clinics across Borno
state and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
              <p>""But we are constrained by concerns about legal risks,

MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Oct 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -
K ellu became pregnant after a Nigerian soldier offered her food
and shelter in exchange for sex. But the destitute teenager -
who lost her family when Boko Haram militants attacked her
village two years earlier - did not want to have the baby.
After moving to a camp for displaced people in northeastern
Borno state, where she relied on neighbours for food,
18-year-old Kellu wanted an abortion but did not know where to
go - like a growing number of women since the Islamist
insurgency began.
""If I continue with this pregnancy, it will ruin my life,""
Kellu, who guessed she was about two months pregnant, told the
Thomson Reuters Foundation, sitting on a mat in a building
pock-marked with bullet holes.
""Everyone will know what I did. They will stigmatise me for
having a baby without a husband. Also, I have no money to take
care of myself. How am I supposed to look after a child?"" asked
Kellu, who declined to publish her real name.
Nigeria has some of the world's most restrictive abortion
laws, which only allow abortion to save the life of the mother.
The Johns Hopkins University estimates that 2.7 million
abortions are carried out in Nigeria each year, the majority
performed secretly and in dangerous conditions, with poor,
uneducated women most at risk.
Health and aid workers say unsafe abortions have surged in
northern Nigeria since the start of the Boko Haram conflict in
2009, which has driven 1.8 million Nigerians from their homes,
according to the United Nations.
At least 40 women and girls come in for emergency
post-abortion care each month, said Aminu, a senior nurse in a
busy government clinic in Yobe state - west of Borno state -
about three times the average of 10 to 15 a month a decade
earlier.
Nigeria has the fourth highest maternal mortality rate
globally, according to the World Health Organization, with about
100 women and girls dying each day.
Death rates in the northeast - where clinics and hospitals
have been destroyed as armed groups fight to create an Islamic
caliphate - are the worst in Nigeria, government data shows.
Women and girls go to pharmacies, vendors of locally made
drugs and older women to terminate pregnancies, using
medication, herbs or tools like sticks, Aminu said.
Fatima, is was in her 40s, went to an aunt who gave her
herbs that caused a miscarriage in a few hours.
""It wasn't a choice, I had to end it,"" said Fatima, who
declined to publish her real name, who was raising five children
and four grandchildren in a displaced camp in Borno state.
""Men say it's immorality. But they are not the ones who have
to give birth and look after the babies. When your children are
telling you they are hungry, how can you have another one?"" she
asked, adding foetuses are often found in the camp's toilets.
Nigerian officials insist the law is upheld.
""Regardless of circumstances, abortion is prohibited except
for medical reasons,"" said Ali Grema, deputy director of
emergency medical response in the health ministry in Borno
state. ""It is not allowed for social reasons.""
TABOO
With many husbands missing, detained or dead, more women are
having sex outside marriage, aid workers said.
While some women choose to get into new relationships, the
United Nations has recorded thousands of cases of sexual
violence and transactional sex, particularly by women and girls
who lack food, shelter or money.
""Many people who are displaced live with hosts who take
advantage of them. If they say no, they may lose their housing,""
said Maryam Aje, head of the African Youth for Peace Development
and Empowerment Foundation, which gives women business grants.
Pointing to a poster in a Maiduguri camp encouraging women
to space their children, Hadiza - a nurse working in a nearby
clinic - said family planning messages focused on married women
because of conservative attitudes.
""Women will ask for contraception but they don't want
husbands to know,"" said Hadiza, who declined to publish her real
name. ""(They) come at night, when nobody is around.""
Hadiza said she often received calls or visits from young
women after working hours, asking for the morning-after pill.
""It's better to prevent such pregnancies than try and deal
with them when they happen,"" she said.
Many girls do not even know sex can make them pregnant, said
Lucy Dlama of Women in New Nigeria, which supports rape
survivors with health care.
""Our culture means it is taboo for parents to discuss sex
education with their daughters,"" said Dlama, who encourages
mothers to teach girls about their bodies. ""They can think it is
stomach pain, give birth and then panic.""
Aminu, the nurse, said most of his patients needing
post-abortion care were teenagers who tried to abort after
several months because they did not know they were pregnant or
hid it.
""They do not die if we admit them to hospital,"" he said.
""But there are so many more cases where women and girls take
herbs on their own, do not come to the hospital and die because
they do not want to expose themselves.""
Pregnancy outside marriage is a taboo, even when it is the
result of rape by soldiers, militias or camp officials.
""They consider you to be a whore and your child to be a
bastard. You have spoiled your family name,"" Aminu said.
Another factor is a decades-old U.S. government policy,
known as the global ""gag rule"" and reinstated by President
Donald Trump in 2017, barring clinics that receive federal funds
from talking to patients about abortion.
""We see young girls and women requesting abortion,"" said one
aid worker who worked to support health clinics across Borno
state and spoke on condition of anonymity.
""But we are constrained by concerns about legal risks,
community reactions and by our U.S. funding which prohibits us
from providing abortion information or services.""
Turning desperate women away is dangerous, said Hauwa
Shekarau of IPAS, an advocacy group promoting safe abortion.
""If the hospital will not help, she will go elsewhere - even
if it is unsafe. We bury our heads in the sand and women
continue to die,"" she said.

              <p>BANGKOK (Reuters) - He is Asia’s most-wanted man. He is protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private jet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night at a Macau casino.</p>
              <p>Tse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected of leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate formed out of an alliance of five of Asia’s triad groups, according to law enforcement officials. Its members call it simply “The Company.” Police, in a nod to one of Tse’s nicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for “Brother Number Three.”</p>
              <p>The syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of methamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen countries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South Pacific. But meth – a highly addictive drug with devastating physical and mental effects on long-term users – is its main business, they say.</p>
              <p>In what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate’s meth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be as high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the cartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a 40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has expanded at least fourfold in the past five years.</p>
              <p>This unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an unprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the prime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously unreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the Australian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about 20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far the biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug trafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in the investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar, China, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan, while not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the investigation.</p>
              <p>A document containing AFP profiles of the operation’s top 19 syndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the leader of the syndicate. According to the document, the organization has “been connected with or directly involved in at least 13 cases” of drug trafficking since January 2015. The document does not provide specific details of the cases.</p>
              <p>A Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the “Multinational CEO” of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional government agencies says Tse is “believed to be” the leader of the Sam Gor syndicate.</p>
              <p>Police have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected boss of the trafficking group.</p>
              <p>Some investigators say that the scope of the syndicate’s operation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin America’s most legendary narco-traffickers. “Tse Chi Lop is in the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,” said Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC. “The word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no doubt it applies here.”</p>
              <p>Reuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to questions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on investigations.</p>
              <p>During the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific to uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This included interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement officials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence reports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings and other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in Myanmar’s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia’s Golden Triangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing drugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited the Thai compound of one of the syndicate’s alleged drug lords.</p>
              <p>What emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly transnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the AFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often refer to as “T1” - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.</p>
              <p>The syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and sophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin American cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies a bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a more diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels do, including Japan’s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic Chinese gangs across Southeast Asia.</p>
              <p>The crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled outbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police say. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked rivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a united pursuit of gargantuan profits.</p>
              <p>“The crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate with seamless efficiency,” says one veteran Western anti-drugs official. “They function like a global corporation.”</p>
              <p>Like most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed, the investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
              <p>In addition to the contrasts between their drug operations, there’s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop and Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed Mexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine trafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their extravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has been revealed about Tse’s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug lords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>A TRIP, A TRAP</p>
              <p>Tse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern China, and grew up during China’s Cultural Revolution. Amid the bloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group of imprisoned members of Mao’s Red Guard in the southern city of Guangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big Circle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police, and like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong Kong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their criminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.</p>
              <p>In the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong, Macau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based in Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling ring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless opium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand, China and Laos meet.</p>
              <p>In 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on drug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New York. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into America, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over his head.</p>
              <p>Through a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged for leniency.</p>
              <p>His ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His 12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed. If freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed “great sorrow” for his crime, court records show.</p>
              <p>The entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to nine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional institution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.</p>
              <p>After he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to Canada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for the next four years. It’s unclear when Tse returned to his old haunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife registered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company Ltd, in Hong Kong in 2011.</p>
              <p>Police suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He “picked up where he left off,” said the senior AFP investigator. Tse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and the Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved irresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his drug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no extra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.</p>
              <p>His policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for business, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011, AFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and meth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather than arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under surveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely for more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug cell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They wanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.</p>
              <p>The syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other drug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and selling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the syndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the Melbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police watched the Australian meet two men.</p>
              <p>One of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted hair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese family man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance showed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal security. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eight worked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as part of his security protocol.</p>
              <p>Tse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts and five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in private jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand for a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt, according to a member of the task force investigating the syndicate.</p>
              <p>Tse was a frequent visitor to Asia’s casinos and fond of betting on horses, especially on English races. “We believe he lost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the tables in Macau,” said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.</p>
              <p>As the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected that the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia with meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the Sam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say, when a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of white powder strapped to each of his thighs.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>‘ALADDIN’S CAVE OF INTEL’</p>
              <p>Cai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the airport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It was the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous, picking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said a former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation. “His hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,” the commander told Reuters. “Methamphetamine is very toxic.”</p>
              <p>Cai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs was a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful tranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. “We were very fortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,” the commander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been monitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police had no idea who he was.</p>
              <p>Cai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a “pesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,” according to Myanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A friend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father. Cai’s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for ketamine at the airport, the commander said.</p>
              <p>Unimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight. The next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport. One recognized him from surveillance work he’d been conducting.</p>
              <p>Still, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they later found on one of his phones might have explained his silence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least three assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch and electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said one investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy saying “Loyalty to the Heavens.” The banner was a “triad-related sign,” he added.</p>
              <p>The tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed the video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat because he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a law enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of the victim’s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad members were sending a message about the price of disloyalty, the officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.</p>
              <p>The torture videos were just one of the items allegedly found in Cai’s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was a diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate’s activities, but sloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones, police say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media conversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.</p>
              <p>They were “an Aladdin’s Cave of intel,” said one AFP commander based in North Asia.</p>
              <p>For at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly traveled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for the syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the Drug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its investigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip from an international courier company recording the delivery of two consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf Chinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea packets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had been cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
              <p>Two days after Cai’s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon address, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That evening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon jetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so, Myanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but other than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate, including couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.</p>
              <p>Then came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery of photos and videos on Cai’s phones, an AFP investigator based in Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing he had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier. “This one stuck out because it was Canadian,” he recalled. “I said: ‘Fuck, I know who you are!'”</p>
              <p>It was Tse Chi Lop.</p>
              <p>The Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of intelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work on Cai’s phones.</p>
              <p>Australia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime gangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade, the AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and small, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent described the database, which includes a trove of names, chemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and surveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence on Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.</p>
              <p>The AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai’s phones with the database. They discovered photos related to three big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in China, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators and Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese anti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and addresses in Cai’s phones to other meth busts in China.</p>
              <p>For regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations upended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by different crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the work of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics agent said they believed Cai was “one of the members of a mega-syndicate,” which had been involved in multiple “drugs cases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.”</p>
              <p>Cai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still in jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking charges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to contact Cai’s lawyer.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>METH PARADISE</p>
              <p>During his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing the country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and obtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a bigger vessel in international waters, according to police and the Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures of the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where the meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.</p>
              <p>The police reconstruction of Cai’s dealings in Myanmar led to another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production had shifted from China’s southern provinces to Shan State in Myanmar’s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had provided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor ingredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were smuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the freedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.</p>
              <p>Armed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan State have long controlled large tracts of territory and used drug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the military. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar government with rebel groups over the years has brought relative calm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to flourish.</p>
              <p>“Production facilities can be hidden from law enforcement and other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,” analyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the International Crisis Group. “Drug production and profits are now so vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.”</p>
              <p>The Myanmar government and police did not respond to questions from Reuters.</p>
              <p>Along the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there is evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts a deep ravine known as the “Valley of Death,” where ethnic Kachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for decades with Myanmar’s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past trucks carrying building materials and workers.</p>
              <p>The Kaung Kha militia’s immaculate and expansive new headquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green hills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers away, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved out of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned out vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba tablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine. When it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more than 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg of caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances used in drug production.</p>
              <p>The Loikan facility was “very likely” to have been the source of much of the Sam Gor syndicate’s meth, said the Yangon-based AFP officer.</p>
              <p>“Some militia were involved in the lab,” said Oi Khun, a communications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia, in an interview. He paused, then added: “But not with the knowledge of senior members” of the militia.</p>
              <p>One person in Loikan described how workers from the lab would come down from the hills. The men, like most of the villagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the locals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.</p>
              <p>“I asked them once. ‘Why don’t you bathe?’” the person said. “They said they did, but there was nothing they could do about the smell.”</p>
              <p>The rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the skin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature stench might reveal their illicit activities. “We all knew,” the person said. “We just didn’t talk about it. That just brings you danger.”</p>
              <p>Meth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals, say Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network’s couriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the Asia-Pacific.</p>
              <p>Shan’s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the world, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told Reuters. “They can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the ground and let it dry.”</p>
              <p>The UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth is worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business model for meth is “very different” to heroin, said the UNODC’s Douglas. “Inputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not needed, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore far, far higher.”</p>
              <p>The wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in northeastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a UNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control Commission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to the UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand, $298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the Japanese market, that’s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.</p>
              <p>The money the syndicate is making “means that if they lose ten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,” said the Chinese counter-narcotics official. “They can afford failure. It doesn’t matter.”</p>
              <p/>
              <p>‘MONEY, MONEY’</p>
              <p>The analysis of Cai’s phones was continuing to provide leads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the pick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with Myanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at sea for weeks.</p>
              <p>One of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the Shun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement document reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea when, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a marine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and paid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV Valkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s and hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea sickness tablets. According to local media, he didn’t have a fishing license at the time.</p>
              <p>After buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on a course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in the Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the rendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western Australian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was seen “unloading a lot of packages” into a van, the commander said.</p>
              <p>“We knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of organized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and comes back with some gear on it, that it hasn’t just dropped from the sky in the middle of the ocean.”</p>
              <p>Investigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car hire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug traffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say, that some of Smith’s alleged co-conspirators were members of an ethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and Comanchero motorcycle gangs, known as “bikies” in Australia.</p>
              <p>As they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of crystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor syndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy of an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians reconvened in Perth a month later.</p>
              <p>Bikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and a self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had refined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star hotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police investigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants, said the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar &amp; Grill in Perth. The restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that included caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.</p>
              <p>On November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again, this time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the Andaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth from Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the Indian Ocean.</p>
              <p>The Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.</p>
              <p>When the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in international waters off the West Australian coast on December 19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting “money, money,” according to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De Man’s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith and his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved their identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by the crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.</p>
              <p>The Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of Geraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The men unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of the AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault weapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty to importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of his alleged associates are still on trial.</p>
              <p>Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it had “worked together with our counterparts on the investigation” of the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the “substantial seizure of illicit narcotics” by the Australian authorities in December 2017. The bureau said it was “aware that Taiwanese syndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in (the) Asia-Pacific region,” and was working “collaboratively and closely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and cross-border drug trafficking.”</p>
              <p/>
              <p>NIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED</p>
              <p>As the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police concluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone a kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the three biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the 1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The other two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse’s original triad, and the Bamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator, the syndicate’s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that it “must rival Apple’s.”</p>
              <p>“The syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market to tap,” said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior colonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade. “The power this network possesses is unimaginable.”</p>
              <p>Investigators have had wins. In February last year, police busted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough tea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66 was intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than one tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor lieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar. In December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected syndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.</p>
              <p>Located near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed compound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used to experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a 100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to the back of the property.</p>
              <p>Sue wasn’t there, but property and money from 38 bank accounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized during the investigation. Sue is still at large.</p>
              <p>But the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the wider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal meth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and Southeast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in most countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising seizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019, “suggested the supply of the drug had expanded.”</p>
              <p>In the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive adversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug motherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product in shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth coming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the syndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This included deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each containing about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on narrow jungle paths.</p>
              <p>Over the years, police have had little success in taking down Asia’s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders have been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to the AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics kingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than a short period was in the mid-1970s. That’s when Ng Sik-ho, a wily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium and morphine, according to court records.</p>
              <p>So far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho’s fate. He is being tracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say counter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they believe he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.</p>

BANGKOK (Reuters) - He is Asia’s most-wanted man. He is protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private jet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night at a Macau casino.
Tse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected of leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate formed out of an alliance of five of Asia’s triad groups, according to law enforcement officials. Its members call it simply “The Company.” Police, in a nod to one of Tse’s nicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for “Brother Number Three.”
The syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of methamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen countries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South Pacific. But meth – a highly addictive drug with devastating physical and mental effects on long-term users – is its main business, they say.
In what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate’s meth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be as high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the cartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a 40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has expanded at least fourfold in the past five years.
This unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an unprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the prime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously unreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the Australian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about 20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far the biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug trafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in the investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar, China, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan, while not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the investigation.
A document containing AFP profiles of the operation’s top 19 syndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the leader of the syndicate. According to the document, the organization has “been connected with or directly involved in at least 13 cases” of drug trafficking since January 2015. The document does not provide specific details of the cases.
A Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the “Multinational CEO” of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional government agencies says Tse is “believed to be” the leader of the Sam Gor syndicate.
Police have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected boss of the trafficking group.
Some investigators say that the scope of the syndicate’s operation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin America’s most legendary narco-traffickers. “Tse Chi Lop is in the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,” said Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC. “The word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no doubt it applies here.”
Reuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to questions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on investigations.
During the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific to uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This included interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement officials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence reports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings and other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in Myanmar’s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia’s Golden Triangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing drugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited the Thai compound of one of the syndicate’s alleged drug lords.
What emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly transnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the AFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often refer to as “T1” - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.
The syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and sophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin American cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies a bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a more diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels do, including Japan’s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic Chinese gangs across Southeast Asia.
The crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled outbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police say. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked rivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a united pursuit of gargantuan profits.
“The crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate with seamless efficiency,” says one veteran Western anti-drugs official. “They function like a global corporation.”
Like most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed, the investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.
In addition to the contrasts between their drug operations, there’s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop and Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed Mexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine trafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their extravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has been revealed about Tse’s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug lords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.

A TRIP, A TRAP
Tse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern China, and grew up during China’s Cultural Revolution. Amid the bloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group of imprisoned members of Mao’s Red Guard in the southern city of Guangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big Circle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police, and like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong Kong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their criminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.
In the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong, Macau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based in Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling ring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless opium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand, China and Laos meet.
In 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on drug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New York. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into America, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over his head.
Through a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged for leniency.
His ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His 12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed. If freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed “great sorrow” for his crime, court records show.
The entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to nine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional institution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.
After he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to Canada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for the next four years. It’s unclear when Tse returned to his old haunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife registered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company Ltd, in Hong Kong in 2011.
Police suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He “picked up where he left off,” said the senior AFP investigator. Tse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and the Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved irresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his drug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no extra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.
His policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for business, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011, AFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and meth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather than arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under surveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely for more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug cell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They wanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.
The syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other drug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and selling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the syndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the Melbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police watched the Australian meet two men.
One of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted hair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese family man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance showed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal security. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eight worked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as part of his security protocol.
Tse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts and five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in private jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand for a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt, according to a member of the task force investigating the syndicate.
Tse was a frequent visitor to Asia’s casinos and fond of betting on horses, especially on English races. “We believe he lost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the tables in Macau,” said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.
As the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected that the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia with meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the Sam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say, when a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of white powder strapped to each of his thighs.

‘ALADDIN’S CAVE OF INTEL’
Cai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the airport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It was the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous, picking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said a former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation. “His hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,” the commander told Reuters. “Methamphetamine is very toxic.”
Cai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs was a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful tranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. “We were very fortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,” the commander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been monitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police had no idea who he was.
Cai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a “pesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,” according to Myanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A friend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father. Cai’s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for ketamine at the airport, the commander said.
Unimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight. The next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport. One recognized him from surveillance work he’d been conducting.
Still, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they later found on one of his phones might have explained his silence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least three assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch and electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said one investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy saying “Loyalty to the Heavens.” The banner was a “triad-related sign,” he added.
The tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed the video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat because he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a law enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of the victim’s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad members were sending a message about the price of disloyalty, the officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.
The torture videos were just one of the items allegedly found in Cai’s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was a diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate’s activities, but sloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones, police say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media conversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.
They were “an Aladdin’s Cave of intel,” said one AFP commander based in North Asia.
For at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly traveled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for the syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the Drug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its investigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip from an international courier company recording the delivery of two consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf Chinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea packets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had been cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.
Two days after Cai’s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon address, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That evening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon jetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so, Myanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but other than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate, including couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.
Then came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery of photos and videos on Cai’s phones, an AFP investigator based in Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing he had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier. “This one stuck out because it was Canadian,” he recalled. “I said: ‘Fuck, I know who you are!'”
It was Tse Chi Lop.
The Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of intelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work on Cai’s phones.
Australia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime gangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade, the AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and small, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent described the database, which includes a trove of names, chemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and surveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence on Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.
The AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai’s phones with the database. They discovered photos related to three big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in China, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators and Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese anti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and addresses in Cai’s phones to other meth busts in China.
For regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations upended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by different crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the work of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics agent said they believed Cai was “one of the members of a mega-syndicate,” which had been involved in multiple “drugs cases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.”
Cai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still in jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking charges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to contact Cai’s lawyer.

METH PARADISE
During his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing the country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and obtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a bigger vessel in international waters, according to police and the Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures of the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where the meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.
The police reconstruction of Cai’s dealings in Myanmar led to another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production had shifted from China’s southern provinces to Shan State in Myanmar’s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had provided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor ingredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were smuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the freedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.
Armed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan State have long controlled large tracts of territory and used drug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the military. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar government with rebel groups over the years has brought relative calm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to flourish.
“Production facilities can be hidden from law enforcement and other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,” analyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the International Crisis Group. “Drug production and profits are now so vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.”
The Myanmar government and police did not respond to questions from Reuters.
Along the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there is evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts a deep ravine known as the “Valley of Death,” where ethnic Kachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for decades with Myanmar’s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past trucks carrying building materials and workers.
The Kaung Kha militia’s immaculate and expansive new headquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green hills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers away, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved out of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned out vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba tablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine. When it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more than 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg of caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances used in drug production.
The Loikan facility was “very likely” to have been the source of much of the Sam Gor syndicate’s meth, said the Yangon-based AFP officer.
“Some militia were involved in the lab,” said Oi Khun, a communications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia, in an interview. He paused, then added: “But not with the knowledge of senior members” of the militia.
One person in Loikan described how workers from the lab would come down from the hills. The men, like most of the villagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the locals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.
“I asked them once. ‘Why don’t you bathe?’” the person said. “They said they did, but there was nothing they could do about the smell.”
The rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the skin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature stench might reveal their illicit activities. “We all knew,” the person said. “We just didn’t talk about it. That just brings you danger.”
Meth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals, say Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network’s couriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the Asia-Pacific.
Shan’s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the world, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told Reuters. “They can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the ground and let it dry.”
The UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth is worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business model for meth is “very different” to heroin, said the UNODC’s Douglas. “Inputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not needed, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore far, far higher.”
The wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in northeastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a UNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control Commission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to the UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand, $298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the Japanese market, that’s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.
The money the syndicate is making “means that if they lose ten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,” said the Chinese counter-narcotics official. “They can afford failure. It doesn’t matter.”

‘MONEY, MONEY’
The analysis of Cai’s phones was continuing to provide leads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the pick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with Myanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at sea for weeks.
One of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the Shun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement document reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea when, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a marine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and paid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV Valkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s and hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea sickness tablets. According to local media, he didn’t have a fishing license at the time.
After buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on a course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in the Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the rendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western Australian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was seen “unloading a lot of packages” into a van, the commander said.
“We knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of organized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and comes back with some gear on it, that it hasn’t just dropped from the sky in the middle of the ocean.”
Investigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car hire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug traffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say, that some of Smith’s alleged co-conspirators were members of an ethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and Comanchero motorcycle gangs, known as “bikies” in Australia.
As they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of crystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor syndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy of an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians reconvened in Perth a month later.
Bikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and a self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had refined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star hotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police investigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants, said the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth. The restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that included caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.
On November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again, this time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the Andaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth from Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the Indian Ocean.
The Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.
When the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in international waters off the West Australian coast on December 19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting “money, money,” according to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De Man’s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith and his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved their identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by the crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.
The Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of Geraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The men unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of the AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault weapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty to importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of his alleged associates are still on trial.
Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it had “worked together with our counterparts on the investigation” of the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the “substantial seizure of illicit narcotics” by the Australian authorities in December 2017. The bureau said it was “aware that Taiwanese syndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in (the) Asia-Pacific region,” and was working “collaboratively and closely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and cross-border drug trafficking.”

NIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED
As the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police concluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone a kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the three biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the 1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The other two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse’s original triad, and the Bamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator, the syndicate’s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that it “must rival Apple’s.”
“The syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market to tap,” said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior colonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade. “The power this network possesses is unimaginable.”
Investigators have had wins. In February last year, police busted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough tea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66 was intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than one tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor lieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar. In December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected syndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.
Located near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed compound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used to experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a 100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to the back of the property.
Sue wasn’t there, but property and money from 38 bank accounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized during the investigation. Sue is still at large.
But the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the wider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal meth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and Southeast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in most countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising seizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019, “suggested the supply of the drug had expanded.”
In the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive adversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug motherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product in shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth coming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the syndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This included deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each containing about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on narrow jungle paths.
Over the years, police have had little success in taking down Asia’s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders have been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to the AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics kingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than a short period was in the mid-1970s. That’s when Ng Sik-ho, a wily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium and morphine, according to court records.
So far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho’s fate. He is being tracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say counter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they believe he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.

              <p>By Tom Allard</p>
              <p>BANGKOK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - He is Asia’s most-wanted man. He
is protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private
jet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night
at a Macau casino.</p>
              <p>Tse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected
of leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate
formed out of an alliance of five of Asia’s triad groups,
according to law enforcement officials. Its members call it
simply “The Company.” Police, in a nod to one of Tse’s
nicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for “Brother Number
Three.”</p>
              <p>The syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of
methamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen
countries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South
Pacific. But meth – a highly addictive drug with devastating
physical and mental effects on long-term users – is its main
business, they say.</p>
              <p>In what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate’s
meth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be
as high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the
cartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a
40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has
expanded at least fourfold in the past five years.</p>
              <p>This unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an
unprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the
prime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously
unreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the
Australian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about
20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far
the biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug
trafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in
the investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar,
China, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan,
while not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the
investigation.</p>
              <p>A document containing AFP profiles of the operation’s top 19
syndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the
leader of the syndicate. According to the document, the
organization has “been connected with or directly involved in at
least 13 cases” of drug trafficking since January 2015. The
document does not provide specific details of the cases.</p>
              <p>A Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the
“Multinational CEO” of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional
government agencies says Tse is “believed to be” the leader of
the Sam Gor syndicate.</p>
              <p>Police have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected
boss of the trafficking group.</p>
              <p>Some investigators say that the scope of the syndicate’s
operation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin
America’s most legendary narco-traffickers. “Tse Chi Lop is in
the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,” said Jeremy
Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC.
“The word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no
doubt it applies here.”</p>
              <p>Reuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to
questions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan’s Ministry
of Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on
investigations.</p>
              <p>During the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific
to uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This
included interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement
officials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence
reports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings
and other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in
Myanmar’s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia’s Golden
Triangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing
drugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited
the Thai compound of one of the syndicate’s alleged drug lords.</p>
              <p>What emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly
transnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the
AFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often
refer to as “T1” - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong,
Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.</p>
              <p>The syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and
sophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin
American cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies
a bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a
more diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels
do, including Japan’s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic
Chinese gangs across Southeast Asia.</p>
              <p>The crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled
outbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police
say. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked
rivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a
united pursuit of gargantuan profits.</p>
              <p>“The crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate
with seamless efficiency,” says one veteran Western anti-drugs
official. “They function like a global corporation.”</p>
              <p>Like most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed,
the investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
              <p>In addition to the contrasts between their drug operations,
there’s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop
and Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed
Mexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine
trafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their
extravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has
been revealed about Tse’s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug
lords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>A TRIP, A TRAP</p>
              <p>Tse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern
China, and grew up during China’s Cultural Revolution. Amid the
bloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group
of imprisoned members of Mao’s Red Guard in the southern city of
Guangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big
Circle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police,
and like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong
Kong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their
criminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.</p>
              <p>In the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong,
Macau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based
in Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling
ring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless
opium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand,
China and Laos meet.</p>
              <p>In 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on
drug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New
York. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into
America, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over
his head.</p>
              <p>Through a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged
for leniency.</p>
              <p>His ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His
12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed.
If freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed
“great sorrow” for his crime, court records show.</p>
              <p>The entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to
nine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional
institution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.</p>
              <p>After he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to
Canada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for
the next four years. It’s unclear when Tse returned to his old
haunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife
registered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company
Ltd, in Hong Kong in 2011.</p>
              <p>Police suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He
“picked up where he left off,” said the senior AFP investigator.
Tse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and
the Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved
irresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his
drug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no
extra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.</p>
              <p>His policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for
business, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011,
AFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and
meth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather
than arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under
surveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely
for more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug
cell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They
wanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.</p>
              <p>The syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other
drug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and
selling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the
syndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the
Melbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police
watched the Australian meet two men.</p>
              <p>One of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted
hair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese
family man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance
showed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal
security. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of
Thai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eight
worked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as
part of his security protocol.</p>
              <p>Tse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts
and five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in
private jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand
for a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt,
according to a member of the task force investigating the
syndicate.</p>
              <p>Tse was a frequent visitor to Asia’s casinos and fond of
betting on horses, especially on English races. “We believe he
lost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the
tables in Macau,” said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.</p>
              <p>As the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected
that the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia
with meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA,
commonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the
Sam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say,
when a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of
white powder strapped to each of his thighs.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>‘ALADDIN’S CAVE OF INTEL’</p>
              <p>Cai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the
airport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It
was the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous,
picking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said
a former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation.
“His hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,” the
commander told Reuters. “Methamphetamine is very toxic.”</p>
              <p>Cai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs
was a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful
tranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. “We were very
fortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,” the
commander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been
monitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police
had no idea who he was.</p>
              <p>Cai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a
“pesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,” according to
Myanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A
friend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father.
Cai’s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for
ketamine at the airport, the commander said.</p>
              <p>Unimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight.
The next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport.
One recognized him from surveillance work he’d been conducting.</p>
              <p>Still, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they
later found on one of his phones might have explained his
silence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least
three assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch
and electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said
one investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy
saying “Loyalty to the Heavens.” The banner was a “triad-related
sign,” he added.</p>
              <p>The tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed
the video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat
because he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a
law enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of
the victim’s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad
members were sending a message about the price of disloyalty,
the officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.</p>
              <p>The torture videos were just one of the items allegedly
found in Cai’s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was
a diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate’s activities, but
sloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones,
police say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media
conversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.</p>
              <p>They were “an Aladdin’s Cave of intel,” said one AFP
commander based in North Asia.</p>
              <p>For at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly
travelled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for
the syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the
Drug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its
investigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip
from an international courier company recording the delivery of
two consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf
Chinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea
packets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had
been cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
              <p>Two days after Cai’s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon
address, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That
evening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon
jetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so,
Myanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but
other than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate,
including couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.</p>
              <p>Then came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery
of photos and videos on Cai’s phones, an AFP investigator based
in Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing
he had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier.
“This one stuck out because it was Canadian,” he recalled. “I
said: ‘Fuck, I know who you are!'”</p>
              <p>It was Tse Chi Lop.</p>
              <p>The Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of
intelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work
on Cai’s phones.</p>
              <p>Australia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime
gangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade,
the AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and
small, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent
described the database, which includes a trove of names,
chemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and
surveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence
on Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.</p>
              <p>The AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai’s
phones with the database. They discovered photos related to
three big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in
China, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators
and Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese
anti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and
addresses in Cai’s phones to other meth busts in China.</p>
              <p>For regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations
upended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by
different crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the
work of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics
agent said they believed Cai was “one of the members of a
mega-syndicate,” which had been involved in multiple “drugs
cases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.”</p>
              <p>Cai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still
in jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking
charges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to
contact Cai’s lawyer.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>METH PARADISE</p>
              <p>During his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing
the country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and
obtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a
bigger vessel in international waters, according to police and
the Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures
of the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where
the meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.</p>
              <p>The police reconstruction of Cai’s dealings in Myanmar led
to another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production
had shifted from China’s southern provinces to Shan State in
Myanmar’s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had
provided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor
ingredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were
smuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in
the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the
freedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.</p>
              <p>Armed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan
State have long controlled large tracts of territory and used
drug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the
military. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar
government with rebel groups over the years has brought relative
calm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to
flourish.</p>
              <p>“Production facilities can be hidden from law enforcement
and other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,”
analyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the
International Crisis Group. “Drug production and profits are now
so vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.”</p>
              <p>The Myanmar government and police did not respond to
questions from Reuters.</p>
              <p>Along the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there
is evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts
a deep ravine known as the “Valley of Death,” where ethnic
Kachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for
decades with Myanmar’s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past
trucks carrying building materials and workers.</p>
              <p>The Kaung Kha militia’s immaculate and expansive new
headquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green
hills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers
away, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved
out of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned
out vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba
tablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine.
When it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more
than 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg
of caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances
used in drug production.</p>
              <p>The Loikan facility was “very likely” to have been the
source of much of the Sam Gor syndicate’s meth, said the
Yangon-based AFP officer.</p>
              <p>“Some militia were involved in the lab,” said Oi Khun, a
communications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia,
in an interview. He paused, then added: “But not with the
knowledge of senior members” of the militia.</p>
              <p>One person in Loikan described how workers from the lab
would come down from the hills. The men, like most of the
villagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the
locals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.</p>
              <p>“I asked them once. ‘Why don’t you bathe?’” the person said.
“They said they did, but there was nothing they could do about
the smell.”</p>
              <p>The rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the
skin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature
stench might reveal their illicit activities. “We all knew,” the
person said. “We just didn’t talk about it. That just brings you
danger.”</p>
              <p>Meth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals,
say Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network’s
couriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the
Asia-Pacific.</p>
              <p>Shan’s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the
world, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told
Reuters. “They can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the
ground and let it dry.”</p>
              <p>The UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth
is worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business
model for meth is “very different” to heroin, said the UNODC’s
Douglas. “Inputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not
needed, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore
far, far higher.”</p>
              <p>The wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in
northeastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a
UNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control
Commission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to
the UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand,
$298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the
Japanese market, that’s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.</p>
              <p>The money the syndicate is making “means that if they lose
ten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,”
said the Chinese counter-narcotics official. “They can afford
failure. It doesn’t matter.”</p>
              <p/>
              <p>‘MONEY, MONEY’</p>
              <p>The analysis of Cai’s phones was continuing to provide
leads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the
pick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with
Myanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at
sea for weeks.</p>
              <p>One of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the
Shun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement
document reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea
when, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a
marine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and
paid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV
Valkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s
and hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea
sickness tablets. According to local media, he didn’t have a
fishing license at the time.</p>
              <p>After buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on
a course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in
the Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the
rendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western
Australian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was
seen “unloading a lot of packages” into a van, the commander
said.</p>
              <p>“We knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of
organized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and
comes back with some gear on it, that it hasn’t just dropped
from the sky in the middle of the ocean.”</p>
              <p>Investigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car
hire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug
traffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say,
that some of Smith’s alleged co-conspirators were members of an
ethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and
Comanchero motorcycle gangs, known as “bikies” in Australia.</p>
              <p>As they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of
crystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor
syndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy
of an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians
reconvened in Perth a month later.</p>
              <p>Bikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and
a self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had
refined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star
hotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police
investigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants,
said the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar &amp; Grill in Perth.
The restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that
included caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.</p>
              <p>On November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again,
this time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the
Andaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth
from Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast
of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the
Indian Ocean.</p>
              <p>The Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.</p>
              <p>When the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in
international waters off the West Australian coast on December
19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting “money, money,”
according to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De
Man’s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith
and his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved
their identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by
the crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.</p>
              <p>The Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of
Geraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The
men unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of
the AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault
weapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty
to importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of
his alleged associates are still on trial.</p>
              <p>Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it
had “worked together with our counterparts on the investigation”
of the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the “substantial
seizure of illicit narcotics” by the Australian authorities in
December 2017. The bureau said it was “aware that Taiwanese
syndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in
(the) Asia-Pacific region,” and was working “collaboratively and
closely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and
cross-border drug trafficking.”</p>
              <p/>
              <p>NIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED</p>
              <p>As the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police
concluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone
a kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the
three biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the
1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The
other two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse’s original triad, and the
Bamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator,
the syndicate’s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that
it “must rival Apple’s.”</p>
              <p>“The syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market
to tap,” said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior
colonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade.
“The power this network possesses is unimaginable.”</p>
              <p>Investigators have had wins. In February last year, police
busted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough
tea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66
was intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than
one tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor
lieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar.
In December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected
syndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.</p>
              <p>Located near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed
compound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used
to experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a
100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to
the back of the property.</p>
              <p>Sue wasn’t there, but property and money from 38 bank
accounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized
during the investigation. Sue is still at large.</p>
              <p>But the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the
wider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal
meth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and
Southeast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in
most countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising
seizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019,
“suggested the supply of the drug had expanded.”</p>
              <p>In the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive
adversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug
motherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product
in shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth
coming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the
syndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This
included deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each
containing about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on
narrow jungle paths.</p>
              <p>Over the years, police have had little success in taking
down Asia’s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders
have been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to
the AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics
kingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than
a short period was in the mid-1970s. That’s when Ng Sik-ho, a
wily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced
to 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium
and morphine, according to court records.</p>
              <p>So far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho’s fate. He is being
tracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say
counter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they
believe he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.</p>

BANGKOK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - He is Asia’s most-wanted man. He
is protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private
jet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night
at a Macau casino.
Tse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected
of leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate
formed out of an alliance of five of Asia’s triad groups,
according to law enforcement officials. Its members call it
simply “The Company.” Police, in a nod to one of Tse’s
nicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for “Brother Number
Three.”
The syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of
methamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen
countries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South
Pacific. But meth – a highly addictive drug with devastating
physical and mental effects on long-term users – is its main
business, they say.
In what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate’s
meth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be
as high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the
cartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a
40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has
expanded at least fourfold in the past five years.
This unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an
unprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the
prime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously
unreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the
Australian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about
20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far
the biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug
trafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in
the investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar,
China, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan,
while not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the
investigation.
A document containing AFP profiles of the operation’s top 19
syndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the
leader of the syndicate. According to the document, the
organization has “been connected with or directly involved in at
least 13 cases” of drug trafficking since January 2015. The
document does not provide specific details of the cases.
A Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the
“Multinational CEO” of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional
government agencies says Tse is “believed to be” the leader of
the Sam Gor syndicate.
Police have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected
boss of the trafficking group.
Some investigators say that the scope of the syndicate’s
operation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin
America’s most legendary narco-traffickers. “Tse Chi Lop is in
the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,” said Jeremy
Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC.
“The word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no
doubt it applies here.”
Reuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to
questions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan’s Ministry
of Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on
investigations.
During the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific
to uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This
included interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement
officials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence
reports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings
and other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in
Myanmar’s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia’s Golden
Triangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing
drugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited
the Thai compound of one of the syndicate’s alleged drug lords.
What emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly
transnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the
AFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often
refer to as “T1” - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong,
Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.
The syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and
sophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin
American cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies
a bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a
more diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels
do, including Japan’s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic
Chinese gangs across Southeast Asia.
The crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled
outbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police
say. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked
rivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a
united pursuit of gargantuan profits.
“The crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate
with seamless efficiency,” says one veteran Western anti-drugs
official. “They function like a global corporation.”
Like most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed,
the investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.
In addition to the contrasts between their drug operations,
there’s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop
and Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed
Mexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine
trafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their
extravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has
been revealed about Tse’s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug
lords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.

A TRIP, A TRAP
Tse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern
China, and grew up during China’s Cultural Revolution. Amid the
bloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group
of imprisoned members of Mao’s Red Guard in the southern city of
Guangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big
Circle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police,
and like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong
Kong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their
criminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.
In the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong,
Macau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based
in Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling
ring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless
opium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand,
China and Laos meet.
In 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on
drug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New
York. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into
America, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over
his head.
Through a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged
for leniency.
His ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His
12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed.
If freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed
“great sorrow” for his crime, court records show.
The entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to
nine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional
institution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.
After he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to
Canada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for
the next four years. It’s unclear when Tse returned to his old
haunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife
registered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company
Ltd, in Hong Kong in 2011.
Police suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He
“picked up where he left off,” said the senior AFP investigator.
Tse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and
the Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved
irresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his
drug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no
extra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.
His policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for
business, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011,
AFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and
meth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather
than arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under
surveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely
for more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug
cell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They
wanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.
The syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other
drug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and
selling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the
syndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the
Melbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police
watched the Australian meet two men.
One of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted
hair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese
family man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance
showed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal
security. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of
Thai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eight
worked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as
part of his security protocol.
Tse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts
and five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in
private jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand
for a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt,
according to a member of the task force investigating the
syndicate.
Tse was a frequent visitor to Asia’s casinos and fond of
betting on horses, especially on English races. “We believe he
lost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the
tables in Macau,” said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.
As the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected
that the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia
with meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA,
commonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the
Sam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say,
when a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of
white powder strapped to each of his thighs.

‘ALADDIN’S CAVE OF INTEL’
Cai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the
airport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It
was the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous,
picking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said
a former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation.
“His hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,” the
commander told Reuters. “Methamphetamine is very toxic.”
Cai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs
was a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful
tranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. “We were very
fortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,” the
commander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been
monitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police
had no idea who he was.
Cai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a
“pesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,” according to
Myanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A
friend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father.
Cai’s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for
ketamine at the airport, the commander said.
Unimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight.
The next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport.
One recognized him from surveillance work he’d been conducting.
Still, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they
later found on one of his phones might have explained his
silence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least
three assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch
and electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said
one investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy
saying “Loyalty to the Heavens.” The banner was a “triad-related
sign,” he added.
The tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed
the video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat
because he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a
law enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of
the victim’s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad
members were sending a message about the price of disloyalty,
the officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.
The torture videos were just one of the items allegedly
found in Cai’s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was
a diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate’s activities, but
sloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones,
police say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media
conversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.
They were “an Aladdin’s Cave of intel,” said one AFP
commander based in North Asia.
For at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly
travelled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for
the syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the
Drug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its
investigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip
from an international courier company recording the delivery of
two consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf
Chinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea
packets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had
been cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.
Two days after Cai’s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon
address, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That
evening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon
jetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so,
Myanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but
other than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate,
including couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.
Then came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery
of photos and videos on Cai’s phones, an AFP investigator based
in Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing
he had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier.
“This one stuck out because it was Canadian,” he recalled. “I
said: ‘Fuck, I know who you are!'”
It was Tse Chi Lop.
The Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of
intelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work
on Cai’s phones.
Australia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime
gangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade,
the AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and
small, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent
described the database, which includes a trove of names,
chemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and
surveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence
on Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.
The AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai’s
phones with the database. They discovered photos related to
three big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in
China, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators
and Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese
anti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and
addresses in Cai’s phones to other meth busts in China.
For regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations
upended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by
different crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the
work of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics
agent said they believed Cai was “one of the members of a
mega-syndicate,” which had been involved in multiple “drugs
cases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.”
Cai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still
in jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking
charges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to
contact Cai’s lawyer.

METH PARADISE
During his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing
the country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and
obtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a
bigger vessel in international waters, according to police and
the Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures
of the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where
the meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.
The police reconstruction of Cai’s dealings in Myanmar led
to another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production
had shifted from China’s southern provinces to Shan State in
Myanmar’s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had
provided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor
ingredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were
smuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in
the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the
freedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.
Armed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan
State have long controlled large tracts of territory and used
drug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the
military. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar
government with rebel groups over the years has brought relative
calm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to
flourish.
“Production facilities can be hidden from law enforcement
and other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,”
analyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the
International Crisis Group. “Drug production and profits are now
so vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.”
The Myanmar government and police did not respond to
questions from Reuters.
Along the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there
is evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts
a deep ravine known as the “Valley of Death,” where ethnic
Kachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for
decades with Myanmar’s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past
trucks carrying building materials and workers.
The Kaung Kha militia’s immaculate and expansive new
headquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green
hills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers
away, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved
out of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned
out vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba
tablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine.
When it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more
than 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg
of caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances
used in drug production.
The Loikan facility was “very likely” to have been the
source of much of the Sam Gor syndicate’s meth, said the
Yangon-based AFP officer.
“Some militia were involved in the lab,” said Oi Khun, a
communications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia,
in an interview. He paused, then added: “But not with the
knowledge of senior members” of the militia.
One person in Loikan described how workers from the lab
would come down from the hills. The men, like most of the
villagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the
locals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.
“I asked them once. ‘Why don’t you bathe?’” the person said.
“They said they did, but there was nothing they could do about
the smell.”
The rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the
skin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature
stench might reveal their illicit activities. “We all knew,” the
person said. “We just didn’t talk about it. That just brings you
danger.”
Meth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals,
say Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network’s
couriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the
Asia-Pacific.
Shan’s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the
world, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told
Reuters. “They can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the
ground and let it dry.”
The UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth
is worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business
model for meth is “very different” to heroin, said the UNODC’s
Douglas. “Inputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not
needed, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore
far, far higher.”
The wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in
northeastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a
UNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control
Commission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to
the UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand,
$298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the
Japanese market, that’s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.
The money the syndicate is making “means that if they lose
ten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,”
said the Chinese counter-narcotics official. “They can afford
failure. It doesn’t matter.”

‘MONEY, MONEY’
The analysis of Cai’s phones was continuing to provide
leads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the
pick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with
Myanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at
sea for weeks.
One of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the
Shun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement
document reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea
when, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a
marine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and
paid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV
Valkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s
and hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea
sickness tablets. According to local media, he didn’t have a
fishing license at the time.
After buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on
a course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in
the Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the
rendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western
Australian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was
seen “unloading a lot of packages” into a van, the commander
said.
“We knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of
organized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and
comes back with some gear on it, that it hasn’t just dropped
from the sky in the middle of the ocean.”
Investigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car
hire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug
traffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say,
that some of Smith’s alleged co-conspirators were members of an
ethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and
Comanchero motorcycle gangs, known as “bikies” in Australia.
As they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of
crystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor
syndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy
of an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians
reconvened in Perth a month later.
Bikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and
a self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had
refined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star
hotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police
investigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants,
said the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth.
The restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that
included caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.
On November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again,
this time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the
Andaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth
from Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast
of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the
Indian Ocean.
The Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.
When the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in
international waters off the West Australian coast on December
19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting “money, money,”
according to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De
Man’s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith
and his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved
their identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by
the crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.
The Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of
Geraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The
men unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of
the AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault
weapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty
to importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of
his alleged associates are still on trial.
Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it
had “worked together with our counterparts on the investigation”
of the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the “substantial
seizure of illicit narcotics” by the Australian authorities in
December 2017. The bureau said it was “aware that Taiwanese
syndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in
(the) Asia-Pacific region,” and was working “collaboratively and
closely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and
cross-border drug trafficking.”

NIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED
As the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police
concluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone
a kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the
three biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the
1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The
other two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse’s original triad, and the
Bamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator,
the syndicate’s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that
it “must rival Apple’s.”
“The syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market
to tap,” said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior
colonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade.
“The power this network possesses is unimaginable.”
Investigators have had wins. In February last year, police
busted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough
tea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66
was intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than
one tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor
lieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar.
In December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected
syndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.
Located near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed
compound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used
to experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a
100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to
the back of the property.
Sue wasn’t there, but property and money from 38 bank
accounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized
during the investigation. Sue is still at large.
But the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the
wider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal
meth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and
Southeast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in
most countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising
seizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019,
“suggested the supply of the drug had expanded.”
In the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive
adversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug
motherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product
in shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth
coming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the
syndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This
included deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each
containing about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on
narrow jungle paths.
Over the years, police have had little success in taking
down Asia’s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders
have been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to
the AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics
kingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than
a short period was in the mid-1970s. That’s when Ng Sik-ho, a
wily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced
to 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium
and morphine, according to court records.
So far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho’s fate. He is being
tracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say
counter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they
believe he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.

              <p>COPENHAGEN, Oct 11 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Young
activists demonstrating across the world are driving cities to
step up action on climate change, not least because politicians
keep coming face-to-face with them while going about their
business, mayors at a climate conference heard Friday.</p>
              <p>As activists from Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg to
""Extinction Rebellion"" movement protesters take an increasingly
visible stand on climate change, officials feel growing
pressure to respond, mayors gathered in Copenhagen said.</p>
              <p>""If you want to walk the streets of some of the biggest
cities in Poland, you've got to do something about climate
change,"" Warsaw's mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski, told the C40 summit
of mayors committed to action on climate change.</p>
              <p>""The pressure especially from young people is just
enormous,"" he said. ""They are fed up with declarations, with
goals and priorities ... they want to see results"".</p>
              <p>Leaders of more than 90 cities representing more than 700
million people and a quarter of the global economy met in the
Danish capital this week to push for faster action to stem
climate threats.</p>
              <p>The gathering came as Extinction Rebellion climate change
activists took to the streets from London to New Zealand for two
weeks of peaceful civil disobedience.</p>
              <p>""Mayors are on the frontline now,"" former U.S. vice
president Al Gore told the conference. ""You do not have the
luxury of just going away and reading reports about what is
going on. You run into your constituents every single day.""</p>
              <p>On Thursday Extinction Rebellion protesters attempted to
shut down London City Airport, with one protester laying on top
of a plane. On Friday they blocked the headquarters of the BBC,
Britain's public service broadcaster..</p>
              <p>Earlier this week, French members of the movement blocked a
street and bridge in Paris' Chatelet district.</p>
              <p>The city's mayor, Anne Hidalgo, said she shared their
concern.</p>
              <p>""We are facing threats of climate breakdown – the response
that we're seeing from Extinction Rebellion and young climate
strikers around the globe should come as no surprise,"" she said.</p>
              <p>In Copenhagen, city leaders unveiled a series of pledges and
measures to cut planet warming emissions, from reducing meat
consumption to tackling air pollution with cheap bus fares and
vehicle bans.</p>
              <p>But delegates at the summit opening Wednesday were met by
demonstrators from Klima Aktion DK, a local climate action
group, armed with fake binoculars made from toilet rolls.</p>
              <p>""Our message to the C40 Mayors is: The people are watching
you! We want to see action!"" the group wrote on Facebook.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>EMPTY WORDS</p>
              <p>Cities are vital to limit global warming as they account for
about three-quarters of carbon emissions and consume more than
two-thirds of global energy, according to the United Nations.</p>
              <p>Wider use of existing clean technologies - such as electric
buses - could deliver more than half the cuts needed to keep
global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees
Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the U.N. says.</p>
              <p>World leaders agreed in the 2015 Paris Agreement to hold
temperate hikes to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius.</p>
              <p>""Cities are where the climate battle will largely be won or
lost,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the
Copenhagen summit.</p>
              <p>Youth activists invited to the meeting to discuss possible
climate measures demanded a bigger seat at the table and called
for stronger action.</p>
              <p>""We should be a part of the decision process when decisions
regarding our future are being taken,"" said Selma Norgard, a
young Danish climate activist.</p>
              <p>Luisa Neubauer, a founder of the German branch of Fridays
for Future, the movement started by Thunberg, said her 10 months
of activism on climate change had taught her to distrust
politicians.</p>
              <p>""We have become experts in listening to empty words and to
hearing empty promises over and over again. That is painful,""
she said.</p>
              <p>""We just ask to grow old on a planet that can provide
livelihoods for all of us, no matter where we are born"".</p>
              <p>Hilda Nakabuye, the founder of Fridays for Future in Uganda,
said her family had been forced to sell of its land and
livestock as heavy rains, high winds and dry spells linked to
climate change had wiped away crops and made the soil barren.</p>
              <p>""Your beds might be comfortable right now but not for long.
You'll soon feel the same heat that we feel every day,"" she
warned.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>NO MAGIC WAND</p>
              <p>Many mayors in attendance said they were inspired by the

            "		"By Umberto Bacchi
COPENHAGEN, Oct 11 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Young
activists demonstrating across the world are driving cities to
step up action on climate change, not least because politicians
keep coming face-to-face with them while going about their
business, mayors at a climate conference heard Friday.
As activists from Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg to
""Extinction Rebellion"" movement protesters take an increasingly
visible stand on climate change, officials feel growing
pressure to respond, mayors gathered in Copenhagen said.
""If you want to walk the streets of some of the biggest
cities in Poland, you've got to do something about climate
change,"" Warsaw's mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski, told the C40 summit
of mayors committed to action on climate change.
""The pressure especially from young people is just
enormous,"" he said. ""They are fed up with declarations, with
goals and priorities ... they want to see results"".
Leaders of more than 90 cities representing more than 700
million people and a quarter of the global economy met in the
Danish capital this week to push for faster action to stem
climate threats.
The gathering came as Extinction Rebellion climate change
activists took to the streets from London to New Zealand for two
weeks of peaceful civil disobedience.
""Mayors are on the frontline now,"" former U.S. vice
president Al Gore told the conference. ""You do not have the
luxury of just going away and reading reports about what is
going on. You run into your constituents every single day.""
On Thursday Extinction Rebellion protesters attempted to
shut down London City Airport, with one protester laying on top
of a plane. On Friday they blocked the headquarters of the BBC,
Britain's public service broadcaster..
Earlier this week, French members of the movement blocked a
street and bridge in Paris' Chatelet district.
The city's mayor, Anne Hidalgo, said she shared their
concern.
""We are facing threats of climate breakdown – the response
that we're seeing from Extinction Rebellion and young climate
strikers around the globe should come as no surprise,"" she said.
In Copenhagen, city leaders unveiled a series of pledges and
measures to cut planet warming emissions, from reducing meat
consumption to tackling air pollution with cheap bus fares and
vehicle bans.
But delegates at the summit opening Wednesday were met by
demonstrators from Klima Aktion DK, a local climate action
group, armed with fake binoculars made from toilet rolls.
""Our message to the C40 Mayors is: The people are watching
you! We want to see action!"" the group wrote on Facebook.

EMPTY WORDS
Cities are vital to limit global warming as they account for
about three-quarters of carbon emissions and consume more than
two-thirds of global energy, according to the United Nations.
Wider use of existing clean technologies - such as electric
buses - could deliver more than half the cuts needed to keep
global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees
Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the U.N. says.
World leaders agreed in the 2015 Paris Agreement to hold
temperate hikes to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius.
""Cities are where the climate battle will largely be won or
lost,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the
Copenhagen summit.
Youth activists invited to the meeting to discuss possible
climate measures demanded a bigger seat at the table and called
for stronger action.
""We should be a part of the decision process when decisions
regarding our future are being taken,"" said Selma Norgard, a
young Danish climate activist.
Luisa Neubauer, a founder of the German branch of Fridays
for Future, the movement started by Thunberg, said her 10 months
of activism on climate change had taught her to distrust
politicians.
""We have become experts in listening to empty words and to
hearing empty promises over and over again. That is painful,""
she said.
""We just ask to grow old on a planet that can provide
livelihoods for all of us, no matter where we are born"".
Hilda Nakabuye, the founder of Fridays for Future in Uganda,
said her family had been forced to sell of its land and
livestock as heavy rains, high winds and dry spells linked to
climate change had wiped away crops and made the soil barren.
""Your beds might be comfortable right now but not for long.
You'll soon feel the same heat that we feel every day,"" she
warned.

NO MAGIC WAND
Many mayors in attendance said they were inspired by the
resolve shown by young activists - and somewhat surprised by the
rapid growth of their movement.
Milan's mayor, Giuseppe Sala, said the city council was
planning to consult young people in climate matters.
But translating ideas into concrete action was not always
easy, as not everybody agrees on what should be done, said the
mayor of Lisbon, Fernando Medina.
Even simple measures such as creating more cycle lanes often
face opposition from residents and politicians when, for
example, they encroach on parking spaces, he said.
""I don't have a magic wand,"" he said. ""But I can tell (young
people) that I can work every day to make things happen more
quickly"".
Others lamented that cities alone could not solve the
climate crisis.
""Cities are leading the change, but countries need to do
their part too,"" said the mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau.
At least 70 countries announced plans at a U.N. climate
action summit last month to boost their effors to cut emissions,
but most major economies, including the United States and China,
failed to announce stronger new measures.
The world is now at a crossroads between ""extinction or
opportunity"", said U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a
Democratic member of Congress.
""Every decision we make between now and (within) our
children's lifetimes will determine how human life will fare,
whether we'll suffer greatly or build together,"" she told the
summit.

              <p>DAKAR, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Propelled to
fashion fame by Beyonce, an African clothing designer plans to
expand production in Senegal and train local tailors to
translate her brand's success into jobs, she said.</p>
              <p>Sarah Diouf's Tongoro designs gained an international
following after the superstar wore her patterned dresses and
wide-leg pants on vacation in Italy last year, causing sales to
nearly triple.</p>
              <p>The 31-year-old was then asked to make a custom design for
Beyonce, who wore a Tongoro suit and dressed her dancers in its
jewellery in her ""Spirit"" music video for ""The Lion King"" film.</p>
              <p>R&amp;B singer Alicia Keys and British model Naomi Campbell have
also been spotted in Tongoro, whose pieces are sold online for
about 200 euros ($220).</p>
              <p>But rising demand for ""Made in Africa"" fashion has not yet
benefited many people at home, said Diouf, who employs only
seven tailors so far. With more local training and online sales,
she thinks Senegal's nascent clothing industry can grow.</p>
              <p>""We have so much talent, but I think we just need a little
bit more structure to take it to the next level,"" said Diouf in
an interview in the Senegalese capital, Dakar.</p>
              <p>""For me, the Beyonce storyline is opening the conversation
and opening doors.""</p>
              <p>Diouf started her brand in 2016 after going back and forth
between Dakar and Paris and realising that her friends in France
were eager to buy the clothes she had made in Senegal.</p>
              <p>Dakar is known for its vibrant fashion scene but most
tailors are self-taught, work on street corners and have no way
to reach a wider customer base.</p>
              <p>After Tongoro was featured in Elle and Vogue magazines,
Diouf recognised its potential to sell worldwide. She plans to
scale up next year and eventually open a production facility
with 100 to 150 tailors.</p>
              <p>""I feel like, for so long, everything that comes from Africa
has been associated with bad quality,"" she said.</p>
              <p>""It was important for me to push that narrative forward, to
say, you can actually buy something from Africa that is not
cliche ... but something that can be modern and youthful.""</p>
              <p>The challenges are big. Senegalese tailors are not used to
producing en masse, and selling clothes online is a relatively
new idea for locals, said Diouf.</p>
              <p>If more African businesses embraced e-commerce it could be a
game-changer for expanding their reach, she said.</p>
              <p>""In Dakar there are more and more emerging brands,"" said
Diouf. ""I think with the new generation, especially because
we're more keen on digital, things are slowly changing.""</p>
              <p>Her biggest markets are currently Nigeria, South Africa and
Ghana but she hopes to lower prices as the company grows and
become an African version of Zara, the giant Spanish chain.</p>
              <p>""To scale, I will have to invest in training. I think this
is the next challenge for 'Made in Africa',"" she said.</p>
              <p>""We have a lot of artisans with great skills and talent, but
when it comes to scale we cannot afford to have one item not
looking alike.""</p>

advocate as one of 10 young people “changing the world” in its

for LGBT communities in Brazil and beyond,” the U.S. magazine
said.</p>
              <p>The drag performer, who identifies as gay and genderfluid,
has become something of an internet sensation in recent years,

              <p>It is also one of the world’s deadliest countries for LGBT+
people, with 320 gay and trans people murdered there last year,
according to watchdog group Grupo Gay da Bahia.</p>

children, some lying on blankets, midway across the bridge over
the Rio Grande. Dozens of U.S. border agents stood behind a gate
topped with razor wire, which blocked the path into the United

              <p>A Honduran man responded by indicating the lumps and rash on

unhygienic conditions in the camp.</p>
              <p>He said Mexican officials encouraged those in the camp to

U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
              <p>Their sense of uncertainty comes amid news of shifting U.S.
policies. The U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision last month
that would allow the U.S. government to deny asylum to people

GATEWAY BRIDGE, U.S.-Mexico border, Oct 10 (Reuters) -
M igrants seeking asylum in the United States who are camped in a
dangerous Mexican border town occupied a bridge to Brownsville,
Texas on Thursday, leading U.S. authorities to close the
crossing, witnesses and authorities said.
Hundreds of the migrants have been sleeping for weeks on the
end of the bridge in Matamoros, Mexico, a city known for gang
violence and for cartels that control human trafficking.
Many of those living in tents or on the sidewalk in a plaza
abutting the bridge are awaiting court dates for hearings in the
United States weeks or months later under a U.S. policy called
the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).
Video shot by a Reuters photographer showed men, women and
children, some lying on blankets, midway across the bridge over
the Rio Grande. Dozens of U.S. border agents stood behind a gate
topped with razor wire, which blocked the path into the United
States.
Some migrants said they were trying to cross as a group into
the United States, and were frustrated that court dates kept
being pushed backwards, leaving them uncertain of how long they
would be stuck in Mexico.
""We want to argue to cross over - we didn't ask to be in
Mexico, they sent us here unjustly,"" said a man who declined to
give his name. He said he had a court date in the United States.
Matamoros mayor Mario Lopez and a Mexican migration official
pleaded with asylum-seekers to clear the blockage.
A Honduran man responded by indicating the lumps and rash on
the throat of his young daughter, which he attributed to
unhygienic conditions in the camp.
He said Mexican officials encouraged those in the camp to
take a government paid-for bus back to the border with
Guatemala, instead of pursuing their U.S. asylum claims. He said
this was not a safe option for his family.
""I'd have to go back to Honduras. And you know the news
there. If we go back to Honduras, in one day, in 24 hours, we're
dead.""
Tens of thousands of Hondurans have fled gang violence and
criminality in the country, whose murder rate ranks among the
world’s highest.
Elias Rodriguez, public affairs liaison for U.S. Customs and
Border Protection in Brownsville, wrote in a statement that
traffic on the Gateway bridge between the two cities remained
closed in both directions and that Thursday's MPP immigration
court hearings were being rescheduled.
Rodriguez separately told Reuters there had been no
violence.
More than 51,000 migrants, mostly asylum seekers, have been
returned to Mexico under MPP. At least 8,000 have been sent to
Matamoros, a border city in crime-wracked Taumaulipas state,
since the policy was expanded in July from other parts of the
U.S.-Mexico border.
Their sense of uncertainty comes amid news of shifting U.S.
policies. The U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision last month
that would allow the U.S. government to deny asylum to people
who have passed through a third country, such as Mexico, and not
requested refuge there first.

              <p>Under pressure from world governing body FIFA, Iranian

stadium, lifting a ban in place for over 40 years.</p>
              <p>""It's a good thing, but part of me is very angry, especially
about the bars between the women and men,"" she told the Thomson

              <p>Shojaei said only 3,500 tickets were allocated for women
even though there were many empty seats in the stadium.</p>
              <p>""This is a direct example of gender discrimination when
there are thousands of empty seats and women can't buy tickets.
Many women are very angry,"" she said by phone from Turkey.</p>
              <p>Shojaei called on FIFA to ensure that Iran lifts the ban
completely and permanently so that women have the same access to
tickets as men for all matches countrywide.</p>
              <p>Government spokesman Ali Rabiei said he viewed women's

              <p>COPENHAGEN, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From
electric buses to pollution-sucking urban gardens, cities around
the world are experimenting with ways to ensure global climate
goals are met, as they account for about three-quarters of
planet-warming emissions, according to the United Nations.</p>
              <p>Here are seven award-winning initiatives to make cities
greener, announced by the C40 network of cities tackling climate
change on Thursday:</p>
              <p/>
              <p>1. MEDELLIN, Colombia - Colombia's second city has invested
more
than $16 million to plant almost 9,000 trees to form 30 ""green
corridors"" across the city since 2016. Besides capturing
pollution, the plants have helped reduce average temperatures in
the city by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) and increased
biodiversity, providing friendly habitats for animals.</p>
              <p>2. ACCRA, Ghana - Since 2016, Accra has been working with
more than
600 informal refuse collectors, who used to dump rubbish that
was burned at illegal open-air sites, causing pollution. More
waste is now being collected, recycled and disposed of safely.</p>
              <p>3. KOLKATA, India - Kolkata is planning to have its entire
5,000-strong bus fleet, as well as ferries crossing the Ganges
River, run on electricity by 2030. It has bought 80 electric
buses and plans to add another 100 next year.</p>
              <p>4. LONDON, United Kingdom - London introduced the world's
first
Ultra Low Emission Zone in 2019, requiring all vehicles passing
through the city centre to meet strict emissions standards or
pay a fee. Within months, the number of more polluting vehicles
fell by a third as people were pushed to walk, cycle or use
public transport.</p>
              <p>5. SAN FRANCISCO, United States - San Francisco's
CleanPowerSF
programme allows residents to get their electricity completely
or in large part from renewable sources at competitive rates.
The city hopes this will help it achieve a goal of reducing
greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2025.</p>
              <p>6. GUANGZHOU, China - Since 2017, Guangzhou has invested
$2.1
billion to convert its entire fleet of 11,220 buses to run on
electricity and installed some 4,000 charging stations to power
them. This has reduced air pollution and noise as well as the
city's transport system operational costs.</p>
              <p>7. SEOUL, South Korea - Seoul has subsidised the
installation of
solar panels on balconies and rooftops of 1 million homes since
2017, as well as city buildings like schools and parking lots.
The city hopes to produce up to 1 GW of solar energy - equal to
that generated by a nuclear reactor - by 2022.</p>

COPENHAGEN, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From
electric buses to pollution-sucking urban gardens, cities around
the world are experimenting with ways to ensure global climate
goals are met, as they account for about three-quarters of
planet-warming emissions, according to the United Nations.
Here are seven award-winning initiatives to make cities
greener, announced by the C40 network of cities tackling climate
change on Thursday:

1. MEDELLIN, Colombia - Colombia's second city has invested
more
than $16 million to plant almost 9,000 trees to form 30 ""green
corridors"" across the city since 2016. Besides capturing
pollution, the plants have helped reduce average temperatures in
the city by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) and increased
biodiversity, providing friendly habitats for animals.
2. ACCRA, Ghana - Since 2016, Accra has been working with
more than
600 informal refuse collectors, who used to dump rubbish that
was burned at illegal open-air sites, causing pollution. More
waste is now being collected, recycled and disposed of safely.
3. KOLKATA, India - Kolkata is planning to have its entire
5,000-strong bus fleet, as well as ferries crossing the Ganges
River, run on electricity by 2030. It has bought 80 electric
buses and plans to add another 100 next year.
4. LONDON, United Kingdom - London introduced the world's
first
Ultra Low Emission Zone in 2019, requiring all vehicles passing
through the city centre to meet strict emissions standards or
pay a fee. Within months, the number of more polluting vehicles
fell by a third as people were pushed to walk, cycle or use
public transport.
5. SAN FRANCISCO, United States - San Francisco's
CleanPowerSF
programme allows residents to get their electricity completely
or in large part from renewable sources at competitive rates.
The city hopes this will help it achieve a goal of reducing
greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2025.
6. GUANGZHOU, China - Since 2017, Guangzhou has invested
$2.1
billion to convert its entire fleet of 11,220 buses to run on
electricity and installed some 4,000 charging stations to power
them. This has reduced air pollution and noise as well as the
city's transport system operational costs.
7. SEOUL, South Korea - Seoul has subsidised the
installation of
solar panels on balconies and rooftops of 1 million homes since
2017, as well as city buildings like schools and parking lots.
The city hopes to produce up to 1 GW of solar energy - equal to
that generated by a nuclear reactor - by 2022.

NAIROBI, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda
announced plans on Thursday for a bill that would impose the
death penalty on homosexuals, saying the legislation would curb
a rise in unnatural sex in the east African nation.
The bill - colloquially known as ""Kill the Gays"" in Uganda -
was nullified five years ago on a technicality and the
government said it plans to resurrect it within weeks.
""Homosexuality is not natural to Ugandans, but there has

FEARFUL
Moves to restrict LGBT+ rights and criminalise gay sex in
other countries have sparked protests and sanctions.
In May, Brunei was forced to extend a moratorium on the
death penalty for gay sex after celebrities such as actor George
Clooney condemned a law allowing whipping and stoning to death.
Last November, anti-gay remarks by a senior official in
Tanzania led to the east African nation's second biggest donor,

""But we are ready. We don't like blackmailing. Much as we

governance, we can't just bend our heads and bow before people

Pepe Julian Onziema from Sexual Minorities Uganda, an
alliance of LGBT+ organisations, said its members were fearful.
""When the law was introduced last time, it whipped up
homophobic sentiment and hate crimes,"" said Onziema.
""Hundreds of LGBT+ people have been forced to leave the
country as refugees and more will follow if this law is enacted.
It will criminalise us from even advocated for LGBT+ rights, let

planners, who will conduct the survey.
But there are few other details on the law's rollout, said
Arbind Singh, a coordinator for NASVI.
""The same authorities promised implementation five years
ago. Now, with local elections in Delhi due soon, the promise of
implementation looks to be just a political gimmick,"" he said,
referring to polls due by February next year.
""Meanwhile, evictions continue - so we are very skeptical.""

              <p>ADDIS ABABA, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Every
day, Tewdros Belay turns on the tap in his home in the heart of
Ethiopia's capital and expects nothing to happen. The rare times
when water does trickle from the spout, it is reason to
celebrate.</p>
              <p>""Sometimes we do not get water for so many weeks - if we get
water, we welcome it by dancing,"" said Tewdros, 32, with a sad
smile.</p>
              <p>Like many of his neighbours in the Kirkos district of Addis
Ababa, and like thousands of others living in the city, Tewdros
has struggled to secure a regular supply of clean water in his
home for at least 10 years.</p>
              <p>Ethiopia is the source of up to 80% of the River Nile's
water. But getting enough potable water to everyone in the
country who needs it is a challenge, water experts and officials
say.</p>
              <p>The capital has long suffered with water shortages, the
result of an aging and limited water supply system, lack of
water storage and a rapidly growing population.</p>
              <p>Environmental experts warn that climate change will only
make matters worse in the future.</p>
              <p>Hoping to ease the shortage, the Addis Ababa government has
embarked on a series of development projects aimed at pumping
storing, cleaning and delivering more groundwater.</p>
              <p>The latest, the Legedadi Phase II Water Project, launched in
April, aims to supply the city with an additional 86,000 cubic
metres of clean water per day.</p>
              <p>That would help boost the area of the city receiving regular
water supply from 60% to 66%, according to Nigusse Desalegn,
spokesman for the Addis Ababa Water and Sewerage Authority
(AAWSA).</p>
              <p>The government also plans to install additional groundwater
infrastructure that would supply the city with another 130,000
cubic metres of clean water a day, Nigusse said.</p>
              <p>""We believe (these projects) will play a significant role in
solving the growing water scarcity problem,"" he said.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>GROWING DEMAND</p>
              <p>Currently, the dams, reservoirs and wells that constitute
the Addis Ababa water supply system provide less than two-thirds
of the 930,000 cubic metres of potable water residents need
every day, according to the AAWSA.</p>
              <p>Nigusse pointed to Ethiopia's steady economic growth, and
its rising population, as factors in Addis Ababa's clean water
shortage.</p>
              <p>The city's water demands have almost doubled in the past
five years, he said, and that demand is rising every day as the
capital expands both out and up, with a boom in the construction
of apartment blocks and offices, Nigusse said.</p>
              <p>Bisrat Kifle, a researcher and associate professor at
Ethiopian Civil Service University, said the problem will get
worse as extreme weather events such as flooding and drought
become more common.</p>
              <p>Research by Bisrat and his colleagues published in 2017
estimated that by 2039 Addis Ababa's current population of more
than 3.5 million will reach 7 million.</p>
              <p>As that happens, water scarcity could heighten ""as a result
of complex interaction of urbanisation and climate change"", it
noted.</p>
              <p>The capital already experiences bouts of heavy rainfall and
""we project rainfall will increase and the effect will be
siltation (of reservoirs) due to flooding,"" Bisrat said.</p>
              <p>When soil washes into reservoirs, it leaves less room for
storing water. As a result, he said, Addis Ababa and some of its
suburbs could be facing an additional clean water shortfall of
up to 380 million cubic meters per year.</p>
              <p>The health consequences of lack of water can be dire, health
experts say.</p>
              <p>Among Ethiopia's population of more than 100 million, about
42 million people do not have access to safe drinking water,
according to the Barcelona-based We Are Water Foundation.</p>

saw an advertisement for a job at Thai Union Group, a global
seafood supplier and the world's biggest producer of tuna.</p>
              <p>The 44-year-old paid a local recruitment agency about 4,300

              <p>""The first thing we did was give MWRN access to our facility

              <p>In 2015, the European Union (EU) gave Thailand a ""yellow
card"" warning for failing to prevent illegal and unregulated
fish from entering the supply chain and ending up in Europe. It
required Thailand to clean up in six months or face a trade ban.</p>
              <p>The EU removed the yellow card in January this year in light
of efforts by Thailand to combat human trafficking and improve
conditions for workers.</p>
              <p>But fisheries associations - emboldened by a change in
government - are now pushing for a relaxation to the rules.</p>
              <p>Among the demands: dropping age restrictions so 16-year-olds
can work on fishing boats, scrapping vessel inspections; letting
vessels swap out crew and catch at sea, far from any oversight.</p>
              <p>""One of the main challenges Thailand is facing at the moment
is ensuring that the reforms that have been painstakingly
introduced over the past five years are not swiftly removed and

industry to ‘business as usual’,"" said Steve Trent, executive
director of Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF), an advocacy
group that investigates environmental and human rights abuses.</p>
              <p>Industry experts are also urging Thailand to grant migrant
workers the same rights in terms of freedom to organise and

MWRN then ensures the recruits do not pay any extra fees.
""We have found cases of brokers charging workers up to
500,000 kyat ($327) to find work with Thai Union, and when this
happens, we investigate what money they paid and who they paid
it to and if necessary we'd pay it back,"" MWRN secretary general
Sein Htay told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
About 500,000 baht of fees have been returned to Thai Union
workers, he said.
Now the challenge is to ensure workers pay no fees.
Jacques-chai Chomthongdi, a policy and campaign manager at
British charity Oxfam, said workers could pay up to four times
the legal limit of 150,000 kyat at home to get work abroad.
""Workers still have to bear these costs, and those in debt
are at risk of forced labour,"" Chomthongdi said.
He spoke on behalf of a coalition of civil society
organisations that advise the Thai seafood industry.
Thai Union was a trailblazer in fighting modern slavery, he
said, but smaller firms are now adopting similar policies in a
bid to stamp out exploitation during the recruitment process.
""Other companies, some with a much smaller scale, are
starting to catch up,"" said Chomthongdi.
""This is a welcome development. However, if they (Thai
Union) don't adapt and ensure that the implementation of
existing good policies are maintained rigorously, they might
eventually become a follower.""

'BUSINESS AS USUAL'
In 2015, the European Union (EU) gave Thailand a ""yellow
card"" warning for failing to prevent illegal and unregulated
fish from entering the supply chain and ending up in Europe. It
required Thailand to clean up in six months or face a trade ban.
The EU removed the yellow card in January this year in light
of efforts by Thailand to combat human trafficking and improve
conditions for workers.
But fisheries associations - emboldened by a change in
government - are now pushing for a relaxation to the rules.
Among the demands: dropping age restrictions so 16-year-olds
can work on fishing boats, scrapping vessel inspections; letting
vessels swap out crew and catch at sea, far from any oversight.
""One of the main challenges Thailand is facing at the moment
is ensuring that the reforms that have been painstakingly
introduced over the past five years are not swiftly removed and
replaced with policies that would return the
industry to ‘business as usual’,"" said Steve Trent, executive
director of Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF), an advocacy
group that investigates environmental and human rights abuses.
Industry experts are also urging Thailand to grant migrant
workers the same rights in terms of freedom to organise and
collective bargaining as Thai workers.
At Thai Union, employees can email their concerns, post
suggestions to post boxes or call a third-party hotline.
""Collaboration and engagement is key to solving the world's
big challenges like ending modern slavery,"" McBain said.

              <p>SOUTH 24 PARGANAS, India/DHAKA, Oct 9 (Thomson Reuters
Foundation) - P riya was 15 when a relative in Bangladesh tricked
her with the promise of a dream job as a singer, drugged her,
and trafficked her across the border into the sex trade in
India.</p>
              <p>After several failed attempts to escape the brothel in the
eastern state of West Bengal where she was trapped for six
years, Priya was rescued along with other girls from Bangladesh
and India in a raid by police and anti-trafficking campaigners.</p>
              <p>Heading home and pursuing her musical ambitions beckoned, or
so she thought. But three years after her rescue, the prospects
of making it back to her family appeared ever more distant.</p>
              <p>For Priya, now 24, was one of about 180 Bangladeshi sex
trafficking survivors stuck in shelters in West Bengal - with
many having waited years for official clearance to go home due
to complex and lengthy bureaucracy across the two countries.</p>
              <p>""How long can I wait?"", said Priya, using her 'brothel name'
to hide her identity for fear of being shamed in Bangladesh.</p>
              <p>""Maybe I won't go now even if they ask me to,"" she said last
month at a shelter, sitting in a room adorned with paper roses.</p>
              <p>Victims wishing to return home must first gain approval from
police, social workers, judges, border forces and bureaucrats at
both state and federal level, a process that involves about 15
steps, analysis by the Thomson Reuters Foundation has revealed.</p>
              <p>While the two nations are working towards faster returns,
the long waits facing dozens of survivors could stymie their
efforts to start life afresh back home and leave them vulnerable
to being trafficked again, according to activists.</p>
              <p>""Living in a shelter ... can be traumatic,"" said Tariqul
Islam of Justice and Care, a charity that reintegrates victims
in Bangladesh. ""When they return after two years or more, it
becomes hard for them to adjust to the changes and recover.""</p>
              <p>""Traffickers often keep track of their victims even after
they return home. When they notice that the girl does not have a
job, or is finding it hard to adjust, they target her again.""</p>
              <p/>
              <p>FASTER RETURNS AFOOT</p>
              <p>Thousands of Bangladeshis are trafficked to India each year
- many of whom are sold into prostitution or domestic servitude
- anti-slavery activists say, although official data is lacking.</p>
              <p>In the last eight years, Bangladesh has brought home about
1,750 trafficking survivors from India, predominantly women and
girls in West Bengal and the western state of Maharashtra.</p>
              <p>However anti-slavery charities that help victims in India
say most are kept in shelters for years - first awaiting the
conclusion of court proceedings, then the repatriation process.</p>
              <p>Justice is often slow and convictions are rare. One in four
trafficking cases in India leads to conviction, while in
Bangladesh, only 30 convictions have been secured under a 2012
law, with more than 4,000 cases still awaiting trial.</p>
              <p>India and Bangladesh signed a partnership in 2015 to speed
up repatriations, but how a victim is treated - whether it is
their experience with the judiciary or the wait to go home -
varies from one Indian state to another, according to activists.</p>
              <p>A long-awaited deal aimed at streamlining the system is to
be finalised soon, officials from the two governments said.</p>
              <p>""At the moment it sometimes takes 18 to 22 months,"" said
Ferdousi Akhter, joint secretary with Bangladesh's interior
ministry. Yet charities say it can drag on for up to six years.</p>
              <p>""A victim has to go through many layers to be repatriated
from India,"" Akhter added. ""We are in talks to cut down these
layers ... victims can surely make faster returns.""</p>
              <p>SLEEPLESS NIGHTS</p>
              <p>In a small house on the outskirts of Bangladesh's capital
Dhaka, mother-of-two Basiron remembered the call to say her
missing daughters had been found in a brothel in India a year
after they disappeared.</p>
              <p>""When I heard the news, I screamed! I felt as though my
heart was going to burst,"" the 47-year-old single parent said.</p>
              <p>The girls - now aged 16 and 17 - were rescued in 2017 from a
brothel in West Bengal where they were held in one room, beaten,
plied with drink and drugs until addicted, and repeatedly raped.</p>
              <p>Two years on, they are still waiting to go home.</p>
              <p>Charges against the 16 people arrested in their trafficking
case are yet to be filed in court, which refused them permission
to return and testify from Bangladesh.</p>
              <p>At a shelter for trafficking victims in a village in West
Bengal, the two sisters showed off sketches of huts surrounded
by trees and a river - their way of remembering home.</p>
              <p>The younger girl, Neela, said she wanted to take out a loan
and set up a beauty parlour when she finally returns home.</p>
              <p>""The Indian girls who were rescued with us went back home in
no time,"" said Neela, whose right arm was covered with scars -
evidence of self-harm during her time in the brothel.</p>
              <p>""We feel happy for them. Maybe we too will go back one day.""</p>
              <p>Basiron and her daughters stay in touch through occasional
phone calls - they do not discuss the case but talk about meals
and movies they have enjoyed - yet the mother is losing hope
over their return and is increasingly worried for their safety.</p>
              <p>""There are times when I see reports on the news about
children getting kidnapped or killed ... those nights are the
hardest to sleep,"" said Basiron, who works as a domestic helper.</p>
              <p>""I haven't seen them in three years. Not even a photo. I
don't know what they look like.""</p>
              <p/>
              <p>CASES PENDING</p>
              <p>West Bengal has a 21-week deadline for a rescued victim to
be sent back home but it is rarely met, state officials said,
due to lengthy court cases in India and the time it takes
Bangladesh to confirm that a survivor is one of its citizens.</p>
              <p>That is due to the high volume of cases, the fact that some
victims do not share their home addresses for fear of reprisals
against their families, and because relatives cannot always
identify them easily after years apart.</p>
              <p>To ensure faster returns, India has started sharing photos
of victims with Bangladeshi officials over the past year, having
previously just provided their name, sex and age.</p>
              <p>Sitting at her desk, state government anti-trafficking
consultant Madhumita Haldar showed two photos of a teenage
Bangladeshi victim on her smartphone. In one she was wearing a
headscarf, in the other her face was covered in garish make-up.</p>
              <p>""But how is a parent supposed to recognise their child from
this?"" she asked, surrounded by victim case files stacked high.</p>
              <p>More than 80% of the 180 female trafficking victims in West
Bengal waiting to go home still have not had their nationality
verified by Bangladesh and some have been waiting for over a
year, Haldar said.</p>
              <p>A Bangladeshi officer who declined to be named said police
never took more than six weeks to complete the process, despite
some delays in verifying victims' addresses.</p>
              <p>Yet in one case, a teenage girl died of acute abdominal pain
that shelter officials later linked to her withdrawal from
alcohol and drugs as she waited for her repatriation order to be
completed by Bangladesh, according to activist Tapoti Bhowmick.</p>
              <p>""Within a day and a half (of her death), all the paperwork
was completed and the clearances were in place,"" said Bhowmick
from Sanlaap, an anti-trafficking charity in West Bengal.</p>

            "		"By Roli Srivastava and Naimul Karim
SOUTH 24 PARGANAS, India/DHAKA, Oct 9 (Thomson Reuters
Foundation) - P riya was 15 when a relative in Bangladesh tricked
her with the promise of a dream job as a singer, drugged her,
and trafficked her across the border into the sex trade in
India.
After several failed attempts to escape the brothel in the
eastern state of West Bengal where she was trapped for six
years, Priya was rescued along with other girls from Bangladesh
and India in a raid by police and anti-trafficking campaigners.
Heading home and pursuing her musical ambitions beckoned, or
so she thought. But three years after her rescue, the prospects
of making it back to her family appeared ever more distant.
For Priya, now 24, was one of about 180 Bangladeshi sex
trafficking survivors stuck in shelters in West Bengal - with
many having waited years for official clearance to go home due
to complex and lengthy bureaucracy across the two countries.
""How long can I wait?"", said Priya, using her 'brothel name'
to hide her identity for fear of being shamed in Bangladesh.
""Maybe I won't go now even if they ask me to,"" she said last
month at a shelter, sitting in a room adorned with paper roses.
Victims wishing to return home must first gain approval from
police, social workers, judges, border forces and bureaucrats at
both state and federal level, a process that involves about 15
steps, analysis by the Thomson Reuters Foundation has revealed.
While the two nations are working towards faster returns,
the long waits facing dozens of survivors could stymie their
efforts to start life afresh back home and leave them vulnerable
to being trafficked again, according to activists.
""Living in a shelter ... can be traumatic,"" said Tariqul
Islam of Justice and Care, a charity that reintegrates victims
in Bangladesh. ""When they return after two years or more, it
becomes hard for them to adjust to the changes and recover.""
""Traffickers often keep track of their victims even after
they return home. When they notice that the girl does not have a
job, or is finding it hard to adjust, they target her again.""

FASTER RETURNS AFOOT
Thousands of Bangladeshis are trafficked to India each year
- many of whom are sold into prostitution or domestic servitude
- anti-slavery activists say, although official data is lacking.
In the last eight years, Bangladesh has brought home about
1,750 trafficking survivors from India, predominantly women and
girls in West Bengal and the western state of Maharashtra.
However anti-slavery charities that help victims in India
say most are kept in shelters for years - first awaiting the
conclusion of court proceedings, then the repatriation process.
Justice is often slow and convictions are rare. One in four
trafficking cases in India leads to conviction, while in
Bangladesh, only 30 convictions have been secured under a 2012
law, with more than 4,000 cases still awaiting trial.
India and Bangladesh signed a partnership in 2015 to speed
up repatriations, but how a victim is treated - whether it is
their experience with the judiciary or the wait to go home -
varies from one Indian state to another, according to activists.
A long-awaited deal aimed at streamlining the system is to
be finalised soon, officials from the two governments said.
""At the moment it sometimes takes 18 to 22 months,"" said
Ferdousi Akhter, joint secretary with Bangladesh's interior
ministry. Yet charities say it can drag on for up to six years.
""A victim has to go through many layers to be repatriated
from India,"" Akhter added. ""We are in talks to cut down these
layers ... victims can surely make faster returns.""
SLEEPLESS NIGHTS
In a small house on the outskirts of Bangladesh's capital
Dhaka, mother-of-two Basiron remembered the call to say her
missing daughters had been found in a brothel in India a year
after they disappeared.
""When I heard the news, I screamed! I felt as though my
heart was going to burst,"" the 47-year-old single parent said.
The girls - now aged 16 and 17 - were rescued in 2017 from a
brothel in West Bengal where they were held in one room, beaten,
plied with drink and drugs until addicted, and repeatedly raped.
Two years on, they are still waiting to go home.
Charges against the 16 people arrested in their trafficking
case are yet to be filed in court, which refused them permission
to return and testify from Bangladesh.
At a shelter for trafficking victims in a village in West
Bengal, the two sisters showed off sketches of huts surrounded
by trees and a river - their way of remembering home.
The younger girl, Neela, said she wanted to take out a loan
and set up a beauty parlour when she finally returns home.
""The Indian girls who were rescued with us went back home in
no time,"" said Neela, whose right arm was covered with scars -
evidence of self-harm during her time in the brothel.
""We feel happy for them. Maybe we too will go back one day.""
Basiron and her daughters stay in touch through occasional
phone calls - they do not discuss the case but talk about meals
and movies they have enjoyed - yet the mother is losing hope
over their return and is increasingly worried for their safety.
""There are times when I see reports on the news about
children getting kidnapped or killed ... those nights are the
hardest to sleep,"" said Basiron, who works as a domestic helper.
""I haven't seen them in three years. Not even a photo. I
don't know what they look like.""

CASES PENDING
West Bengal has a 21-week deadline for a rescued victim to
be sent back home but it is rarely met, state officials said,
due to lengthy court cases in India and the time it takes
Bangladesh to confirm that a survivor is one of its citizens.
That is due to the high volume of cases, the fact that some
victims do not share their home addresses for fear of reprisals
against their families, and because relatives cannot always
identify them easily after years apart.
To ensure faster returns, India has started sharing photos
of victims with Bangladeshi officials over the past year, having
previously just provided their name, sex and age.
Sitting at her desk, state government anti-trafficking
consultant Madhumita Haldar showed two photos of a teenage
Bangladeshi victim on her smartphone. In one she was wearing a
headscarf, in the other her face was covered in garish make-up.
""But how is a parent supposed to recognise their child from
this?"" she asked, surrounded by victim case files stacked high.
More than 80% of the 180 female trafficking victims in West
Bengal waiting to go home still have not had their nationality
verified by Bangladesh and some have been waiting for over a
year, Haldar said.
A Bangladeshi officer who declined to be named said police
never took more than six weeks to complete the process, despite
some delays in verifying victims' addresses.
Yet in one case, a teenage girl died of acute abdominal pain
that shelter officials later linked to her withdrawal from
alcohol and drugs as she waited for her repatriation order to be
completed by Bangladesh, according to activist Tapoti Bhowmick.
""Within a day and a half (of her death), all the paperwork
was completed and the clearances were in place,"" said Bhowmick
from Sanlaap, an anti-trafficking charity in West Bengal.
""Should these girls die to go back to their country?""
Priya's story ends more happily.
Weeks after speaking to the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the
teenager returned to Bangladesh, having spent nearly nine years
in India.
She is now in another shelter, being cared for by a charity,
but is set to return to her family home in the coming weeks.
""It feels really good to finally return,"" Priya said by
phone from the shelter. ""I have forgotten what my house looks
like, but I know that I will be able to recognise once I see it.
""I just want to go home and see my family.""

H appiness Kapota will remember forever the day when her children
lined up in Nairobi to receive their birth certificates.</p>
              <p>Joyce, Caleb and Sidet Moyo were among the first children
from Kenya's stateless Shona group to receive the
government-issued certificates, which will give them
opportunities and rights long denied to the Shona.</p>
              <p>The day was particularly poignant for Kapota, 25, because
she was barred from sitting a key school exam for lack of
documents, forcing her to drop out at 15.</p>
              <p>""My teachers tried to help but there's nothing they could
do, so I dropped out and became a housemaid since we were very
poor,"" Kapota told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding she
hoped to return to school one day.</p>
              <p>Kenya's move to end the plight of the Shona comes amid a
global campaign to eradicate statelessness thought to affect an
estimated 10 million people worldwide who are not recognised as
nationals by any country.</p>
              <p>Kenya sent a high-level delegation to a major
intergovernmental meeting in Geneva on Monday to discuss
progress at the midpoint of the #Ibelong campaign, ahead of a
2024 deadline.</p>
              <p>A person may be stateless as a result of discrimination
based on ethnicity, religion or gender, the transfer of
territory between states, or conflicting nationality laws.</p>
              <p>Stateless people often lack documentation necessary to
attend school, open a bank account, get a job, passport or
mobile phone, or enter government buildings, according to the
U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR).</p>
              <p>The 3,500-strong stateless Shona community has been in Kenya
for more than 50 years, many of them born and raised there, but
they are not recognised as Kenyan nationals and have no official
status in Zimbabwe from where they arrived in the 1960s.</p>
              <p>Kapota's children were among 600 young Shona who received
their birth certificates at a ceremony in August, said Wanja
Munaita, Kenya's UNHCR officer on statelessness.</p>
              <p>About 2,000 adults have also applied and are waiting for
their documents to be processed, she added.</p>
              <p>Kenya set a precedent two years ago when it awarded
citizenship to another stateless group, the Makonde, originally
from Mozambique, ending 80 years of statelessness for its 8,000
people.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>DISCRIMINATION</p>
              <p>Oliver Muregerera, a community leader from the Shona's
Gospel of God Church, said his people have faced widespread
discrimination.</p>
              <p>""We have a lived a life of poverty and squalor since without
documents (we) cannot secure a good job, own property or access
critical government services,"" said Muregerera.</p>
              <p>Shumarry Maleon, a government assistant director of
registration, said all Shona would be issued with birth
certificates.</p>
              <p>But while this is an important step it does not guarantee
the Shona citizenship, a recognition President Uhuru Kenyatta
promised in 2017.</p>
              <p>Kenya has an estimated 18,500 stateless people.</p>
              <p>George Kegoro of the Kenyan Human Rights Commission said the
country could not say it was on course to meet social goals such
as improved access to education and health while failing to
recognise part of its population as citizens.</p>
              <p>Kegoro, the charity's executive director, said birth
certificates were not enough and it was crucial to keep up
pressure until the community received formal recognition.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>BETTER DATA</p>
              <p>Kenya hopes to get a clearer picture of its stateless
population when the results of a national census conducted in
August are made public next year.</p>
              <p>""We have been told that the national census has a provision
to capture data on stateless people which is important, and
UNHCR is appealing to all stateless people in Kenya to come out
and identify themselves during the exercise,"" said the UNHCR's
Munaita.</p>
              <p>African states have increasingly become aware that
statelessness is a major problem.</p>
              <p>A 2017 declaration by the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), a grouping of 15 countries, highlighted the
political will of its member states to tackle the issue.</p>
              <p>The African Court on Human and People's Rights ruled in 2018
that Tanzania arbitrarily deprived a man of Tanzanian
citizenship and ordered the government to update its
legislation, potentially paving the way for other countries to
follow suit.

opportunities and rights long denied to the Shona.
The day was particularly poignant for Kapota, 25, because
she was barred from sitting a key school exam for lack of
documents, forcing her to drop out at 15.
""My teachers tried to help but there's nothing they could
do, so I dropped out and became a housemaid since we were very
poor,"" Kapota told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding she
hoped to return to school one day.
Kenya's move to end the plight of the Shona comes amid a
global campaign to eradicate statelessness thought to affect an
estimated 10 million people worldwide who are not recognised as
nationals by any country.
Kenya sent a high-level delegation to a major
intergovernmental meeting in Geneva on Monday to discuss
progress at the midpoint of the #Ibelong campaign, ahead of a
2024 deadline.
A person may be stateless as a result of discrimination
based on ethnicity, religion or gender, the transfer of
territory between states, or conflicting nationality laws.
Stateless people often lack documentation necessary to
attend school, open a bank account, get a job, passport or
mobile phone, or enter government buildings, according to the
U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR).
The 3,500-strong stateless Shona community has been in Kenya
for more than 50 years, many of them born and raised there, but
they are not recognised as Kenyan nationals and have no official
status in Zimbabwe from where they arrived in the 1960s.
Kapota's children were among 600 young Shona who received
their birth certificates at a ceremony in August, said Wanja
Munaita, Kenya's UNHCR officer on statelessness.
About 2,000 adults have also applied and are waiting for
their documents to be processed, she added.
Kenya set a precedent two years ago when it awarded
citizenship to another stateless group, the Makonde, originally
from Mozambique, ending 80 years of statelessness for its 8,000
people.

DISCRIMINATION
Oliver Muregerera, a community leader from the Shona's
Gospel of God Church, said his people have faced widespread
discrimination.
""We have a lived a life of poverty and squalor since without
documents (we) cannot secure a good job, own property or access
critical government services,"" said Muregerera.
Shumarry Maleon, a government assistant director of
registration, said all Shona would be issued with birth
certificates.
But while this is an important step it does not guarantee
the Shona citizenship, a recognition President Uhuru Kenyatta
promised in 2017.
Kenya has an estimated 18,500 stateless people.
George Kegoro of the Kenyan Human Rights Commission said the
country could not say it was on course to meet social goals such
as improved access to education and health while failing to
recognise part of its population as citizens.
Kegoro, the charity's executive director, said birth
certificates were not enough and it was crucial to keep up
pressure until the community received formal recognition.

BETTER DATA
Kenya hopes to get a clearer picture of its stateless
population when the results of a national census conducted in
August are made public next year.
""We have been told that the national census has a provision
to capture data on stateless people which is important, and
UNHCR is appealing to all stateless people in Kenya to come out
and identify themselves during the exercise,"" said the UNHCR's
Munaita.
African states have increasingly become aware that
statelessness is a major problem.
A 2017 declaration by the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), a grouping of 15 countries, highlighted the
political will of its member states to tackle the issue.
The African Court on Human and People's Rights ruled in 2018
that Tanzania arbitrarily deprived a man of Tanzanian
citizenship and ordered the government to update its
legislation, potentially paving the way for other countries to
follow suit.

              <p>By Emma Batha</p>
              <p>LONDON, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Film star Cate
Blanchett called on Monday for the world to end the
""devastating"" plight of millions of people with no nationality
amid warnings that rising xenophobia is stymieing efforts to
meet a 2024 deadline for eradicating statelessness.</p>
              <p>The double Oscar-winner said statelessness prevented people
fulfilling their potential, and was a ""heartbreaking"" waste of
human talent.</p>
              <p>Blanchett threw her weight behind the global #Ibelong
campaign to end statelessness as she addressed an
intergovernmental meeting in Geneva aimed at dramatically
escalating progress.</p>
              <p>Her support will boost attention on an issue that has long
been neglected.</p>
              <p>Not recognised as nationals of any country, stateless people
are often deprived of basic rights like education and
healthcare, and risk exploitation and detention.</p>
              <p>Blanchett held up her own passport, credit card and Medicare
card as she urged ministers and government officials to imagine
how difficult life would be if they had no documents.</p>
              <p>""It's a condition of invisibility,"" she said. ""Stateless
people are unseen and unheard.""</p>
              <p>Blanchett, a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. refugee agency
(UNHCR), interviewed Maha Mamo, a formerly stateless activist
who has become a torchbearer for #Ibelong, describing her as an
""extraordinary beacon of hope"".</p>
              <p>The activist, who speaks five languages, told delegates how
her hopes of studying medicine and joining a Lebanese basketball
team were crushed because she had no papers.</p>
              <p>The Geneva meeting comes halfway through the #Ibelong
initiative launched in 2014.</p>
              <p>But the task ahead is monumental. Only about 200,000 people
acquired citizenship during the first half of the campaign,
barely making a dent in the overall number.</p>
              <p>And U.N. officials admit the total may now be even higher
than in 2014 because of increasing displacement triggered by
crises in Syria, Venezuela and elsewhere, which has raised the
risk of many children growing up stateless.</p>
              <p>There is also no solution in sight for many of the largest
groups of stateless people including the Rohingya, hundreds of
thousands of whom have fled to Bangladesh following an upsurge
in violence.</p>
              <p>U.N. officials are also keeping a close eye on India, where
1.9 million people in the northeastern state of Assam have been
left off a register of citizens, stoking concerns that many
could become stateless.</p>
              <p>UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi said global awareness of the
repercussions of statelessness was growing and they had received
more than 170 pledges of action ahead of the meeting.</p>
              <p>But he warned that ""damaging forms of nationalism"" and the
""manipulation of anti-refugee and migrant sentiment"" were
putting progress at risk.</p>
              <p>DOGS HAVE MORE RIGHTS</p>
              <p>People end up stateless for a host of reasons including
migration, flawed citizenship laws and ethnic discrimination.
Others fall through the cracks when countries break up.</p>
              <p>Aside from Myanmar, there are big stateless groups in Ivory
Coast, Thailand, Nepal, Kuwait and some former Soviet countries.</p>
              <p>Stateless people have previously told the Thomson Reuters
Foundation that they feel stigmatised and forgotten.</p>
              <p>""We've had people telling us, 'dogs are more important than
I am',"" said Melanie Khanna, head of the UNHCR's statelessness
section.</p>
              <p>""People feel totally scarred and isolated. They often say,
'I thought it was just me'. It sends chills down your spine.""</p>
              <p>Almost all countries are represented at the Geneva meeting,
with some 1,000 delegates including a number of ministers. U.N.
officials say the pledges will provide a roadmap for
accelerating the campaign.</p>
              <p>In July, Kyrgyzstan made history when it became the first
country to officially end statelessness. U.N. officials believe
Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan could also meet the
2024 deadline.</p>
              <p>Thailand, where nearly 479,000 people are stateless,
including members of ethnic hill tribes in the northern border
regions, is also stepping up action.</p>
              <p>The issue made international headlines last year during
rescue efforts to save a young Thai football team trapped in a
flooded cave.</p>
              <p>During the drama it emerged that several of the boys and
their coach were stateless. They were granted citizenship after
their ordeal.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>WIN-WIN</p>
              <p>But resolving statelessness is not just a human rights
issue. Statelessness has fuelled conflict and displacement in
both Myanmar and Ivory Coast.</p>
              <p>Khanna said there was a growing recognition that resolving
statelessness was a ""win-win"" because it was in governments'
interests to have everybody feel invested in the society they
lived in and motivated to contribute.</p>
              <p>The U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of
global pledges on tackling poverty, inequality and other ills
with an overall ambition to ""to leave no one behind"", have
helped shift attitudes, Khanna said.</p>
              <p>""The SDGs have allowed us to talk about this whole area as a
development issue and not just a human rights one,"" she added.</p>
              <p>""This makes a lot of sense because you don't want
disenfranchised, impoverished people on your territory.""</p>
              <p>Khanna said an increasing number of countries were changing
their nationality laws and policies to prevent future
generations ending up in limbo.</p>
              <p>Colombia, for example, has announced it will give
citizenship to thousands of children born to Venezuelan migrants
to prevent them growing up stateless.</p>
              <p>Other countries have scrapped discriminatory laws that
prevent women passing their citizenship to their children - a
major cause of statelessness.</p>
              <p>The impact of such laws has been clearly seen during the
Syrian war with many displaced mothers unable to obtain
documents for their children where the father is dead or absent.</p>
              <p>Iran became the latest country to pass reforms last week.</p>
              <p>There has also been a flurry of countries joining the U.N.
conventions on protecting stateless people and preventing
statelessness.</p>
              <p>The 1961 convention stipulates that a state must grant
nationality to anyone born on its territory who would otherwise
be stateless - a safeguard that would wipe out most new cases of
statelessness if adopted by all countries.</p>
              <p>Blanchett appealed to all nations to give stateless people
""their basic human right to belong"", adding that solutions were
often straightforward.
""It is a man-made problem and it is solvable,"" she said.

            "		"(Reworks and updates with Cate Blanchett quotes)
By Emma Batha
LONDON, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Film star Cate
Blanchett called on Monday for the world to end the
""devastating"" plight of millions of people with no nationality
amid warnings that rising xenophobia is stymieing efforts to
meet a 2024 deadline for eradicating statelessness.
The double Oscar-winner said statelessness prevented people
fulfilling their potential, and was a ""heartbreaking"" waste of
human talent.
Blanchett threw her weight behind the global #Ibelong
campaign to end statelessness as she addressed an
intergovernmental meeting in Geneva aimed at dramatically
escalating progress.
Her support will boost attention on an issue that has long
been neglected.
Not recognised as nationals of any country, stateless people
are often deprived of basic rights like education and
healthcare, and risk exploitation and detention.
Blanchett held up her own passport, credit card and Medicare
card as she urged ministers and government officials to imagine
how difficult life would be if they had no documents.
""It's a condition of invisibility,"" she said. ""Stateless
people are unseen and unheard.""
Blanchett, a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. refugee agency
(UNHCR), interviewed Maha Mamo, a formerly stateless activist
who has become a torchbearer for #Ibelong, describing her as an
""extraordinary beacon of hope"".
The activist, who speaks five languages, told delegates how
her hopes of studying medicine and joining a Lebanese basketball
team were crushed because she had no papers.
The Geneva meeting comes halfway through the #Ibelong
initiative launched in 2014.
But the task ahead is monumental. Only about 200,000 people
acquired citizenship during the first half of the campaign,
barely making a dent in the overall number.
And U.N. officials admit the total may now be even higher
than in 2014 because of increasing displacement triggered by
crises in Syria, Venezuela and elsewhere, which has raised the
risk of many children growing up stateless.
There is also no solution in sight for many of the largest
groups of stateless people including the Rohingya, hundreds of
thousands of whom have fled to Bangladesh following an upsurge
in violence.
U.N. officials are also keeping a close eye on India, where
1.9 million people in the northeastern state of Assam have been
left off a register of citizens, stoking concerns that many
could become stateless.
UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi said global awareness of the
repercussions of statelessness was growing and they had received
more than 170 pledges of action ahead of the meeting.
But he warned that ""damaging forms of nationalism"" and the
""manipulation of anti-refugee and migrant sentiment"" were
putting progress at risk.
DOGS HAVE MORE RIGHTS
People end up stateless for a host of reasons including
migration, flawed citizenship laws and ethnic discrimination.
Others fall through the cracks when countries break up.
Aside from Myanmar, there are big stateless groups in Ivory
Coast, Thailand, Nepal, Kuwait and some former Soviet countries.
Stateless people have previously told the Thomson Reuters
Foundation that they feel stigmatised and forgotten.
""We've had people telling us, 'dogs are more important than
I am',"" said Melanie Khanna, head of the UNHCR's statelessness
section.
""People feel totally scarred and isolated. They often say,
'I thought it was just me'. It sends chills down your spine.""
Almost all countries are represented at the Geneva meeting,
with some 1,000 delegates including a number of ministers. U.N.
officials say the pledges will provide a roadmap for
accelerating the campaign.
In July, Kyrgyzstan made history when it became the first
country to officially end statelessness. U.N. officials believe
Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan could also meet the
2024 deadline.
Thailand, where nearly 479,000 people are stateless,
including members of ethnic hill tribes in the northern border
regions, is also stepping up action.
The issue made international headlines last year during
rescue efforts to save a young Thai football team trapped in a
flooded cave.
During the drama it emerged that several of the boys and
their coach were stateless. They were granted citizenship after
their ordeal.

WIN-WIN
But resolving statelessness is not just a human rights
issue. Statelessness has fuelled conflict and displacement in
both Myanmar and Ivory Coast.
Khanna said there was a growing recognition that resolving
statelessness was a ""win-win"" because it was in governments'
interests to have everybody feel invested in the society they
lived in and motivated to contribute.
The U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of
global pledges on tackling poverty, inequality and other ills
with an overall ambition to ""to leave no one behind"", have
helped shift attitudes, Khanna said.
""The SDGs have allowed us to talk about this whole area as a
development issue and not just a human rights one,"" she added.
""This makes a lot of sense because you don't want
disenfranchised, impoverished people on your territory.""
Khanna said an increasing number of countries were changing
their nationality laws and policies to prevent future
generations ending up in limbo.
Colombia, for example, has announced it will give
citizenship to thousands of children born to Venezuelan migrants
to prevent them growing up stateless.
Other countries have scrapped discriminatory laws that
prevent women passing their citizenship to their children - a
major cause of statelessness.
The impact of such laws has been clearly seen during the
Syrian war with many displaced mothers unable to obtain
documents for their children where the father is dead or absent.
Iran became the latest country to pass reforms last week.
There has also been a flurry of countries joining the U.N.
conventions on protecting stateless people and preventing
statelessness.
The 1961 convention stipulates that a state must grant
nationality to anyone born on its territory who would otherwise
be stateless - a safeguard that would wipe out most new cases of
statelessness if adopted by all countries.
Blanchett appealed to all nations to give stateless people
""their basic human right to belong"", adding that solutions were
often straightforward.
""It is a man-made problem and it is solvable,"" she said.

              <p>NIAMEY, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Abdulaziz,
Aminatu, Absatu, Abdulmanaf. Fahad. And, well, also Mansour.
They are the names Zeinab Garba has in mind for any future
children she has.</p>
              <p>But for now the mother of two has decided to set aside plans
for more offspring by using a contraceptive, to give a better
future to Rachid, her restless 3-year-old boy, and her newborn
son Bilyaminou, mostly a passionate sleeper for now.</p>
              <p>""I'm proud to wear the (contraceptive) implant,"" said Garba,
20.</p>
              <p>In a country with the world's highest birth rate per woman,
hers is an uncommon move and, to some, a controversial one.</p>
              <p>But environmentalists and youth activists in Niger hope it
is one more families will embrace, to help reduce threats from
the destructive effects of a changing climate.</p>
              <p>Climate change has meant Niger has seen a swift rise in
temperatures and less abundant water flows in rivers, in
addition to more intense droughts and floods, said Issa Lele, a
meteorologist with the United Nations Development Programme.</p>
              <p>That is a growing threat to food and water supplies - and
the pressures heighten as the nation's population booms, with
each woman having on average 7.6 children, said Sani Ayouba, the
director of environmental group Young Volunteers for the
Environment.</p>
              <p>""We're not saying to stop having children,"" Ayouba, who has
three offspring of his own, said at a September meeting with
local non-profit leaders, prompting a wave of laughter.</p>
              <p>Instead, he said, his group advocates the use of
contraceptives to slow the rate of births - a relief to one
listener who said he was expecting his fifth child.</p>
              <p>Around the world, a rising global population is increasing
pressure on the world's limited resources, with every additional
person in need of food, transport, energy and other resources
that drive climate change.</p>
              <p>That pressure is worst in the richest countries, where each
additional person consumes far more resources than an added
child in a poorer country.</p>
              <p>But very high birthrates in places like Niger also mean the
country's own limited resources must be shared among more people
- a particular problem as climate change disrupts farming and
herding, threatening food supplies.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>EFFECTIVE - BUT CONTROVERSIAL</p>
              <p>At the clinic where Garba was getting a contraceptive
implant on a September afternoon, in the district of Talladje in
Niamey, herds of cows made their way to pasture just outside.</p>
              <p>She breathed deeply when a midwife poked two tiny holes in
her arm with a needle and slid in the small, elongated implant.</p>
              <p>The five-minute procedure will give her three years without
a pregnancy, with a 99% effectiveness rate, the midwife said.</p>
              <p>The pill is by far the most popular birth control method in
Niger, but at this clinic of the international charity Marie
Stopes it is an implant, placed under the skin, that most women
seek, said Adama Abdoulaye, a doctor who coordinates the clinic.</p>
              <p>More women like Garba streamed in and out of the center's
waiting room, glancing at soap operas playing on the television.</p>
              <p>Nigerien authorites back some aspects of family planning,
and have begun to allocate money toward the push, said Issoufou
Harou, director of family planning at Niger's Ministry of Public
Health.</p>
              <p>But a national budget of 200 million FCFA ($340,000) for
purchasing contraceptives doesn't go far enough, said Salamatou
Traore, president of the Coalition of Stakeholders for the
Repositioning of Family Planning in Niger.</p>
              <p>Even that budget - and Garba's tiny implant - raise big
questions in this highly devout Islamic society, however.</p>
              <p>Some 99% of Nigerians are Muslim, census data shows, and
Islam does not advocate limiting the number of children in a
family if they are well cared for, said Sita Amadou of the
Islamic Association of Niger, the chief Islamic organisation in
the country.</p>
              <p>That complicates the ambitious plans of environmental
activists who since last year have been working to spread family
planning as a buffer against the effects of climate change in
Niger.</p>
              <p>The activists have met with parliamentarians and cabinet
ministers, as well as a range of community groups.</p>
              <p>At a recent gathering, in a small, damp room in Niamey, a
dozen representatives listened, silently at first, to the pitch
about a novel way of fighting growing climate pressures.</p>
              <p>""It's not just about investing in agriculture so that it is
organic or sustainable but also in contraceptive methods and
family planning everywhere,"" said Ayouba, who spoke alongside
Issa Garba, who heads the Nigerien Youth Network on Climate
Change.</p>
              <p>But worries quickly arose from a handful of listeners.
Muslim authorities will not accept the proposal, one participant
commented.</p>
              <p>Ayouba and Garba said current projections - which show the
population of Niger tripling by 2050, from 22 million people
today, according to U.N. estimates - are untenable.</p>
              <p>By some estimates, Niamey, Niger's sleepy capital of 1
million, could become one of the 10 largest cities in Africa by
2100, with as many as 50 million residents as a result of
population growth and urbanisation, European scientists said in
the journal Earth's Future earlier this year.</p>
              <p>The country's 2012-2020 Action Plan for Family Planning
commits to making contraceptives available to half of the
population by next year - though their availability is less than
20% for now, government data shows.</p>
              <p>But Niger's population growth rate is not simply the result
of lack of access to contraception, said Abdou Batouati, a
researcher at the Institute for Research in Human Sciences at
Niamey's Abdou Moumouni University.</p>
              <p>""Culturally, in Niger, women space out their births at a
rate of a child every two years,"" he said.</p>
              <p>In the city's open markets, among bars of soap, stalls of
lemons and the calls of salesmen, some vendors sell boxes of
contraceptive pills, stacked in colorful towers atop trays
carried on the vendors' heads.</p>
              <p>The Pharmacy du Point, in the affluent district of Plateau,
also sells them. On a table, the manager spreads out rectangular
peach, blue and orange boxes of the contraceptives, which sell
for anywhere from 300 to 3,060 FCFA ($0.50 to $5.10).</p>
              <p>But some people think that the pill ""is a way to get people
into debauchery,"" said Adama Jonathna, a midwife at the clinic
that helped Garba with her contraceptive implant.</p>

              <p>""I do not mind doing it, but before that I need to have the
approval of my officials"" to do so, said Gousmane Moussa, the
plan's liaison to national authorities.</p>
              <p>He said U.N. guidelines that inform such adaptation plans do
not urge family planning be a part of them.</p>
              <p>Should Niger make clear the link between reducing birthrates
and lowering climate risks, it might be the first such case in a
national plan, said Christian Ledwell, an adaptation plan
specialist at the International Institute for Sustainable

              <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A
Malaysian recruitment agency set to launch a pioneering
""ethical"" hiring model has called for an industry overhaul to
tackle debt bondage among migrant workers and end modern slavery
in the Southeast Asian nation.</p>
              <p>Led by a team of three women, Kuala Lumpur-based Pinkcollar
has billed itself as the first ethical recruitment agency in
Malaysia, which relies heavily on foreign labourers to fill jobs
in construction, factories or domestic care.</p>
              <p>The company will drop the hefty fees usually imposed by
recruitment firms on workers for helping them find jobs, an
industry-wide policy that has pushed thousands of people into
crippling debt they are rarely able to escape.</p>
              <p>""We are trying to disrupt it (the industry) really,"" founder
Zenna Law told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at Pinkcollar's
office ahead of the ""ethical"" scheme's launch on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>""We are hoping that ... we can elevate the standard of the
entire industry,"" said Law, who along with her partners is in
her 20s and was raised with the help of migrant domestic workers
as a child.</p>
              <p>Malaysia is home to millions of foreign labourers and one of
the top destinations in Asia for impoverished women from
countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines who take up jobs
as domestic workers.</p>
              <p>Cases of abuse have been widely reported, but migrant rights
groups say workers often cannot escape as they have to work to
repay the recruiters that found them work and make deductions
from their monthly wages.</p>
              <p>The Malaysian government said last year it was looking into
ways to cut middlemen and end debt bondage, a form of modern-day
slavery.</p>
              <p>Although it is a first for Malaysia, ethical recruiters have
sprung up in the Philippines and Hong Kong in recent years as
businesses and private households come under pressure to end
slavery.</p>
              <p>Pinkcollar will focus on domestic workers from the
Philippines in its first phase, recruiting through social media
before matching them with employers through interviews that give
both parties a say in the hiring process and terms.</p>
              <p>The hiring fees, which typically range from 12,000 to 18,000
Malaysian ringgit ($2,900-$4,300), will be payable by the
employer, said Pinkcollar's Law.</p>
              <p>The firm's name is derived from the term given to jobs
usually held by women - such as nannies and helpers.</p>

KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A
Malaysian recruitment agency set to launch a pioneering
""ethical"" hiring model has called for an industry overhaul to
tackle debt bondage among migrant workers and end modern slavery
in the Southeast Asian nation.
Led by a team of three women, Kuala Lumpur-based Pinkcollar
has billed itself as the first ethical recruitment agency in
Malaysia, which relies heavily on foreign labourers to fill jobs
in construction, factories or domestic care.
The company will drop the hefty fees usually imposed by
recruitment firms on workers for helping them find jobs, an
industry-wide policy that has pushed thousands of people into
crippling debt they are rarely able to escape.
""We are trying to disrupt it (the industry) really,"" founder
Zenna Law told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at Pinkcollar's
office ahead of the ""ethical"" scheme's launch on Wednesday.
""We are hoping that ... we can elevate the standard of the
entire industry,"" said Law, who along with her partners is in
her 20s and was raised with the help of migrant domestic workers
as a child.
Malaysia is home to millions of foreign labourers and one of
the top destinations in Asia for impoverished women from
countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines who take up jobs
as domestic workers.
Cases of abuse have been widely reported, but migrant rights
groups say workers often cannot escape as they have to work to
repay the recruiters that found them work and make deductions
from their monthly wages.
The Malaysian government said last year it was looking into
ways to cut middlemen and end debt bondage, a form of modern-day
slavery.
Although it is a first for Malaysia, ethical recruiters have
sprung up in the Philippines and Hong Kong in recent years as
businesses and private households come under pressure to end
slavery.
Pinkcollar will focus on domestic workers from the
Philippines in its first phase, recruiting through social media
before matching them with employers through interviews that give
both parties a say in the hiring process and terms.
The hiring fees, which typically range from 12,000 to 18,000
Malaysian ringgit ($2,900-$4,300), will be payable by the
employer, said Pinkcollar's Law.
The firm's name is derived from the term given to jobs
usually held by women - such as nannies and helpers.
""When workers owe agencies, not only they have less freedom
to switch jobs but also to leave bad and unsafe work place. Debt
bondage is what we are trying to tackle,"" Law said.
Migrant rights groups welcomed the initiative but warned its
implementation could be problematic as countries such as
Indonesia would only allow workers to go abroad through its
locally-approved agencies.
""It could be quite chaotic for the sending country because
they want to monitor the whereabouts of the workers,"" said Alex
Ong from advocacy group Migrant Care, which campaigns for
migrant workers in Malaysia.
Recruitment agencies are not allowed to charge workers in
the formal sectors - such as manufacturing and plantation - fees
that are higher one month's salary, under current guidelines set
by the employers' group, the Malaysian Employers' Federation.
But domestic workers are excluded from the clause, and
typically have to spend six months with almost all their wages
deducted to cover the costs they owe the recruiters for local
travel or medical tests, said Ong.
""The question is why this protection is not applicable for
domestic workers too,"" asked Ong, calling for a legal reform.
Malaysia is home to an estimated 212,000 of about 40 million
people trapped in modern slavery worldwide, according to the
Global Slavery Index by human rights group Walk Free Foundation.

              <p/>
              <p>MYANMAR/BANGLADESH: In 1982, Buddhist-majority Myanmar
passed a citizenship law that effectively rendered stateless
most Rohingya, who are Muslim and of South Asian descent.</p>
              <p>Ethnic violence has driven many to leave, but hundreds of
thousands remain in Myanmar. There are about 900,000 Rohingya in
neighbouring Bangladesh and smaller populations across Asia.</p>
              <p>Some are sold into slavery on fishing boats and plantations.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>IVORY COAST: Ivory Coast is home to 692,000 stateless
people. Many are descended from migrants from neighbouring
countries who were encouraged to work on Ivory Coast's coffee
and cotton plantations in the 20th century.</p>
              <p>At least a quarter of Ivory Coast's population is estimated
to be of foreign descent, and the question of who is or is not
Ivorian helped fuel two civil wars in the West African country.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>THAILAND: Nearly 479,000 people are stateless, including
members of ethnic hill tribes such as the Yao, Hmong and Karen
who live in the mountainous border with Myanmar and Laos, and
the semi-nomadic ""Sea Gypsies"" along the Andaman coast.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>ESTONIA/LATVIA: When the Soviet Union broke up, many ethnic
Russians remained in the new Baltic states and were defined as
""non-citizens"".</p>
              <p>Nearly 221,000 stateless people live in Latvia and 78,000 in
Estonia, mainly ethnic Russians who have trouble obtaining
citizenship and at times face discrimination.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>SYRIA: In 1962, many Kurds in the northeast were stripped of
citizenship, a move Human Rights Watch described as part of a
plan to ""Arabise"" the resource-rich region.</p>
              <p>Before the civil war, there were an estimated 300,000
stateless Kurds in Syria, many of whom were promised nationality
by President Bashar al-Assad in reaction to the 2011 uprising.</p>
              <p>U.N. data suggests the number fell to 160,000, but this may
be partly because many fled the war.</p>
              <p>Human rights experts have warned that babies born to Syrian
refugee women in Lebanon and Jordan could end up stateless.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>KUWAIT: Stateless people are known as Bidoon, which is short
for bidoon jinsiya meaning ""without nationality"" in Arabic. Some
trace their origins to nomadic tribes that once moved freely
around the Gulf region.</p>
              <p>There are about 92,000 Bidoon in Kuwait, according to U.N.
data, but some estimates are much higher. They are often barred
from free education, healthcare and many jobs.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>NEPAL: Although Nepal says it does not have a stateless
population, experts on statelessness believe many people,
possibly hundreds of thousands, may be affected.</p>
              <p>Part of the problem derives from a law banning women married
to foreigners from passing their nationality to their children.
There is also a stateless population of people who were expelled
by Bhutan in the 1990s.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: A 2013 court ruling, along with earlier
changes to nationality laws aimed at tackling illegal migration,
has left many stateless, mostly people of Haitian descent who
were born in Dominican Republic.</p>
              <p>In 2015, there were about 134,000 stateless people,
according to U.N. data, but the figures are being updated.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>IRAQ: There are about 47,500 stateless people who include
Bidoon and Faili Kurds, an ethnic group that historically live
both sides of the Iraq-Iran border.</p>
              <p>More than 100,000 Faili Kurds had their nationality revoked
in 1980 under the Ba'ath regime. Although many have since had
their nationality reinstated, others remain stateless.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>EUROPE: Tens of thousands of stateless Roma - an ethnic
group with origins in India - are thought to live in central,
eastern and southern Europe. With the break-up of Czechoslovakia
and Yugoslavia, successor states claimed they belonged
elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Other Roma in Kosovo and Bosnia have become stateless due to
war-time displacement.</p>
              <p>Roma are often unable to register their children's births or
hold official property titles. This can make it hard to prove
where they are from.</p>
              <p/>
              <p>VENEZUELA: Some children born to Venezuelan parents who have
fled to other countries amid a political and economic crisis at
home are at increased risk of statelessness.

LONDON, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - An estimated 10

The U.N. refugee agency is hosting a major intergovernmental

of its #Ibelong campaign which aims to end statelessness by
2024. Here are examples of stateless populations:

MYANMAR/BANGLADESH: In 1982, Buddhist-majority Myanmar

Ethnic violence has driven many to leave, but hundreds of

SYRIA: In 1962, many Kurds in the northeast were stripped of

Before the civil war, there were an estimated 300,000
stateless Kurds in Syria, many of whom were promised nationality
by President Bashar al-Assad in reaction to the 2011 uprising.
U.N. data suggests the number fell to 160,000, but this may
be partly because many fled the war.
Human rights experts have warned that babies born to Syrian
refugee women in Lebanon and Jordan could end up stateless.

KUWAIT: Stateless people are known as Bidoon, which is short
for bidoon jinsiya meaning ""without nationality"" in Arabic. Some
trace their origins to nomadic tribes that once moved freely
around the Gulf region.
There are about 92,000 Bidoon in Kuwait, according to U.N.

from free education, healthcare and many jobs.

NEPAL: Although Nepal says it does not have a stateless
population, experts on statelessness believe many people,
possibly hundreds of thousands, may be affected.
Part of the problem derives from a law banning women married
to foreigners from passing their nationality to their children.
There is also a stateless population of people who were expelled
by Bhutan in the 1990s.

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: A 2013 court ruling, along with earlier
changes to nationality laws aimed at tackling illegal migration,
has left many stateless, mostly people of Haitian descent who
were born in Dominican Republic.
In 2015, there were about 134,000 stateless people,
according to U.N. data, but the figures are being updated.

IRAQ: There are about 47,500 stateless people who include
Bidoon and Faili Kurds, an ethnic group that historically live
both sides of the Iraq-Iran border.
More than 100,000 Faili Kurds had their nationality revoked
in 1980 under the Ba'ath regime. Although many have since had
their nationality reinstated, others remain stateless.

EUROPE: Tens of thousands of stateless Roma - an ethnic
group with origins in India - are thought to live in central,
eastern and southern Europe. With the break-up of Czechoslovakia
and Yugoslavia, successor states claimed they belonged
elsewhere.
Other Roma in Kosovo and Bosnia have become stateless due to
war-time displacement.
Roma are often unable to register their children's births or
hold official property titles. This can make it hard to prove
where they are from.

VENEZUELA: Some children born to Venezuelan parents who have
fled to other countries amid a political and economic crisis at
home are at increased risk of statelessness.

DOGS HAVE MORE RIGHTS
People end up stateless for a host of historical, social and

But resolving statelessness is not just a human rights

Khanna said there was a growing recognition that resolving
statelessness was a ""win-win"" because it was in governments'

GUWAHATI, India, Oct 6 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Abanti
Deka had no idea when she married her husband that taking his
name would jeopardise her Indian citizenship.
That was before authorities in the northeast Indian state of
Assam, where she has lived all her life, launched a vast and
highly contentious exercise to register all its citizens as part
of a campaign against illegal immigration.
When the register was published at the end of August, the
names of nearly 2 million of the state's about 33 million people
were missing, plunging them into a bureaucratic nightmare that
human rights experts fear could render some stateless.
Abanti was one of the unlucky ones.
""The notice came suddenly,"" she told the Thomson Reuters
Foundation at her lawyer's office.
""I don't understand. I was born here, I have voted here
before, but suddenly none of that matters any more.""
Resentment against illegal immigrants has simmered for years
in Assam, one of India's poorest states, with residents blaming
outsiders for taking their jobs and land.
To be included on the register, residents had to produce
documents proving their families lived in India before March 24,
1971, when hundreds of thousands of people began fleeing
conflict across the border in what is now Bangladesh.
Lawyers and campaigners dealing with such cases say they
present particular challenges for women.
About one in three women in Assam is illiterate - a higher
proportion than for men - and many marry young, moving away from
home and losing access to any documents that might prove their
origins.
They also take their husbands' names, a move that has
complicated things further for many married women in a region
where family names are markers of ethnic and religious
affiliation.
""The women have had to pay a higher price,"" said Tanya
Laskar, a lawyer working on such cases.
""They have struggled the hardest to get relevant documents
and many failed because they were child brides or the family did
not put their names on a land document because women are not
entitled to property in many homes.""
PRESSURE
India is expected to face pressure at a major
intergovernmental meeting in Geneva on Monday to assess progress
in a global decade-long campaign aimed at eradicating
statelessness by 2024.
On Wednesday, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
Filippo Grandi expressed concerns that the Assam exercise could
result in some people being made stateless.
There are an estimated 10-15 million stateless people
worldwide who are not recognised as nationals of any country and
are deprived of basic rights most people take for granted such

Those excluded from India's register will have 120 days to
prove their citizenship at hundreds of regional quasi-judicial
bodies known as foreigners' tribunals. If that goes against
them, they can appeal all the way up to India's Supreme Court.
'LONELY BATTLES'
From land deeds to school leaving certificates, voter lists
and birth certificates, residents of Assam have had to spend
thousands of rupees to access their documents from government
offices.
Laskar, who runs awareness campaigns on the process, said
poorer families often spent their limited resources on the men.
""In poor families, a woman's right to justice comes at the
end,"" she said. ""We have had women fainting in our awareness
meetings because they are so worried of what lies ahead. Many

Education is another factor, said Digambar Narzary, head of

State authorities have not provided a breakdown of men and
women omitted from the register. But many married women like
Abanti say they have been left off even though their siblings
and parents were included.
Among them is Aladi Mondol, 42, the only member of the
family she was born into whose name is not on the citizens'

Mondol lost key documents in flooding, common in Assam, and
said she did not realise how important they would become.
""I was trying to salvage so many things from the house as
the river crept in,"" she said.
""I cried when I found out because my brothers and parents
are on the list. I am a little scared.""

SURNAMES MATTER
Debasmita Ghosh, the lawyer representing Abanti at a
foreigners' tribunal in the state capital Guwahati, said her
client had not known that her married name would cause problems.
""They are Assamese and she was born here. She didn't realise
that the surname mattered,"" Ghosh told the tribunal at a recent
hearing to which the Thomson Reuters Foundation gained rare
access.
""In fact, she never mentioned her father's name to us
either, we found it by chance in an old document she gave us,""
said Ghosh, who works with the Human Rights Law Network, a
collective that provides legal aid.
That proved Abanti, who does not know her exact age but is
in her 40s, was called Deka before she married Adhir Hajong and
took his name, which many associate with Bangladesh.
Abanti said her ordeal had made her feel almost invisible,
but knew she had to see it through for her children's sake.
""If I am declared a foreigner, it will impact my children.
They will not get jobs or benefits from the state,"" she said.
""I am not a criminal, but if the tribunal is not convinced
that I was born here then I might be in a detention camp and
that will be the end of the road for my children as well.""

              <p>ILULA, Kenya, Oct 5 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Anyone
hearing the loud singing coming from Isaac Chereger's farm would
be forgiven for thinking it was a particularly enthusiastic
church gathering.</p>
              <p>Instead, it was a group of women calling to order a meeting
of a local religious charity that teaches villagers how to
conserve the forest around their homes in this southwestern
Kenya community, to help stop the Mara River from drying.
For more than a decade, environmental groups have raised the
alarm over the Mara River, warning that population growth,
illegal logging and overuse of its waters by communities
struggling through drought have caused a dramatic drop in the
river's water levels.</p>
              <p>At the meeting on Chereger's farm, some villagers
volunteered to plant saplings where their fields meet the river,
while others agreed to get training on why the unplanned felling
of trees along the river could worsen the impact of drought.</p>
              <p>Chereger told the Thomson Reuters Foundation he is proud of
the conservation work his community does, but has long wondered
if it was enough.</p>
              <p>That's why the Empowering Lives International Centre - which
put on the meeting on his farm - has joined other local
organisations in an effort to give their traditional
conservation work some technological muscle.</p>
              <p>The Stockholm Environment Institute, an international
research organisation, has created a software-based water
evaluation and planning (WEAP) tool designed to help government
agencies and project partners better manage water.</p>

changing water levels, they can more quickly adapt and find the
most effective ways to slow the drying of the river, the
institute's researchers say.</p>
              <p>The group in Ilula village say they are keen to add the
system to their conservation toolbelt.</p>
              <p>""The Mara River gives us pasture and water for our cattle.

basin, recalled that in the 1990s it was impossible for his
cattle to wade through any part of the river because of its
depth.</p>
              <p>These days, even goats walk leisurely through the drying
river to graze on the other side of its shores, the 65-year-old
herder told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p>Starting in the Mau forests, in southwestern Kenya, the Mara

key threats to the river.</p>

along the river are a problem, with some farmers using

agriculture accounting for about half of that.</p>

              <p>UDAIPUR, India, Oct 4 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -
M illions of indigenous people face eviction in India after
states stopped processing new land claims under a law that is
being challenged in the country's highest court, land and human
rights advocates warned on Friday.</p>
              <p>Earlier this year, India's Supreme Court stayed its ruling
that ordered the eviction of millions of indigenous people whose
land claims were rejected, and directed 21 states to file
affidavits with details on how they had processed claims.</p>
              <p>Since then, many of these states had become bogged down with
the legal challenge to the Forest Rights Act (FRA), and now
lacked the resources to process fresh land claims, said Tushar
Dash, a forest rights activist.</p>
              <p>""With these states fully engaged in re-examining the claims,
no new claims are being processed, and nor are states training
local and district officials to ensure claims are processed in
the right manner,"" Dash told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
              <p>""The ongoing case is a big risk to the implementation of
FRA, with the fate of millions hanging in the balance,"" he said.</p>
              <p>India's 104 million tribal people - also known as Adivasis,
or ""original inhabitants"" - make up less than 10% of the
country's population, and are among its most impoverished.</p>
              <p>The FRA, passed in 2006, aimed to improve their lives by
recognising the right of at least 150 million people to inhabit
and live off about 40 million hectares of forest land.</p>
              <p>But states have been slow to implement the law, and more
than half the land claims were rejected, often on flimsy
grounds, indigenous activists said.</p>
              <p>Seventeen states have filed affidavits with the Supreme
Court on how they processed FRA claims, with several stating
that local officials did not follow due process in rejecting
claims, according to land rights campaigners who asked not to be
named as they were not authorised to see the affidavits.</p>
              <p>""Claims were wrongly rejected, claimants were not told why
they were rejected or given time to appeal, as required by the
law,"" said Dash, speaking on the sidelines of a land forum in
Udaipur city in Rajasthan state.</p>
              <p>In Rajasthan, one of 21 states named in the court order,
authorities were following due process, said Qummer Choudhary,
chief of Udaipur city's district council.</p>
              <p>""If the law is not being implemented, I urge you to go to
the local official or the district official and demand
implementation because it is your right,"" he told indigenous
representatives at the forum.</p>
              <p>The case against the FRA was brought by a group of
conservationists and wildlife organisations who said it had led
to fragmentation of forests, threatening biodiversity and
wildlife, and causing deforestation.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the government's draft National Forest Policy
2018 proposes to give forest officials more power against
encroachers, and earmarks more land for reforestation, making
forest dwellers vulnerable to evictions, according to land
rights groups.</p>
              <p>If enacted, the policy would make the FRA largely
ineffective, land activists said.</p>
              <p>A nationwide rally is planned for Nov. 17, ahead of the next
FRA court hearing on Nov. 26, against the proposed forest policy
and to demand the government supports the FRA, according to
human rights group Campaign for Survival and Dignity (CSD).</p>
              <p>While the top court stayed evictions until Nov. 26, there is
no guarantee for indigenous people, Dash said.</p>
              <p>""The threat is not over,"" he said.

or ""original inhabitants"" - make up less than 10% of the
country's population, and are among its most impoverished.
The FRA, passed in 2006, aimed to improve their lives by
recognising the right of at least 150 million people to inhabit
and live off about 40 million hectares of forest land.
But states have been slow to implement the law, and more
than half the land claims were rejected, often on flimsy
grounds, indigenous activists said.
Seventeen states have filed affidavits with the Supreme
Court on how they processed FRA claims, with several stating
that local officials did not follow due process in rejecting
claims, according to land rights campaigners who asked not to be
named as they were not authorised to see the affidavits.
""Claims were wrongly rejected, claimants were not told why
they were rejected or given time to appeal, as required by the
law,"" said Dash, speaking on the sidelines of a land forum in
Udaipur city in Rajasthan state.
In Rajasthan, one of 21 states named in the court order,
authorities were following due process, said Qummer Choudhary,
chief of Udaipur city's district council.
""If the law is not being implemented, I urge you to go to
the local official or the district official and demand
implementation because it is your right,"" he told indigenous
representatives at the forum.
The case against the FRA was brought by a group of
conservationists and wildlife organisations who said it had led
to fragmentation of forests, threatening biodiversity and
wildlife, and causing deforestation.
Meanwhile, the government's draft National Forest Policy
2018 proposes to give forest officials more power against
encroachers, and earmarks more land for reforestation, making
forest dwellers vulnerable to evictions, according to land
rights groups.
If enacted, the policy would make the FRA largely
ineffective, land activists said.
A nationwide rally is planned for Nov. 17, ahead of the next
FRA court hearing on Nov. 26, against the proposed forest policy
and to demand the government supports the FRA, according to
human rights group Campaign for Survival and Dignity (CSD).
While the top court stayed evictions until Nov. 26, there is
no guarantee for indigenous people, Dash said.
""The threat is not over,"" he said.
