        "text": "SAO PAULO, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Brazilian federal police said\nthey have arrested Saifullah Al-Mamun, born in Bangladesh and\nconsidered by authorities one of the world's most prolific human\ntraffickers.\nIn an operation conducted on Thursday after collaboration\nwith U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Brazilian\npolice arrested members of a group allegedly implicated in a\nlarge scheme of smuggling people into the United States.\nSeveral arrests were made in Sao Paulo, where Al-Mamun was\nliving, and in three other Brazilian cities. The police also\nfroze 42 bank accounts it says were used by the group to finance\ntheir activities.\nAl-Mamun entered Brazil six years ago as a refugee, and was\nliving in Bras, a diverse neighborhood in Sao Paulo that is home\nto immigrants from around the world.\nHe has been indicted on U.S. charges. According to the\nUnited States Department of Justice, Al-Mamun is alleged to have\nhoused people coming from Southeast Asia in S\u00e3o Paulo and\narranged for their travel through a network of smugglers\noperating in Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica,\nNicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico.\nAccording to Brazilian police, he and his group were\nsmuggling into Brazil, and then to the United States, people\nfrom Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan.\nThey were sent to Brazil's northern Acre state to start a\nlong and dangerous trip through Central America all the way to\nthe Mexican border, to cross into the United States.\nReuters was not able to confirm whether Al-Mamun had a\nlawyer in Sao Paulo who could be contacted for comment.\nBrazilian police said the group charged people coming from\nAsia around 50,000 reais ($12,524) for the attempt to reach the\nUnited States. Some would also stay illegally in Brazil, where\nthey were given fraudulent documentation.\nPolice said people suffered violence while waiting in Sao\nPaulo to start the trip north. It said a group of eight Bengali\npeople fell into the hands of a Mexican drug cartel while\ntraveling toward the Mexico-U.S. border.\n($1 = 3.9924 reais)\n(Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira in Sao Paulo\nEditing by Matthew Lewis)",

        "text": "By Rina Chandran\nPENANG, Malaysia, Oct 21 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -\nH ousing millions of refugees returning to Afghanistan is one of\nthe biggest challenges facing the country as it attempts to meet\nthe basic needs of its people amid the world's longest-running\nwar, a senior government official said.\nThere are more than 2.6 million registered refugees in the\nworld from Afghanistan, the highest number after Syria,\naccording to the United Nations. In addition, more than two\nmillion have been internally displaced by the ongoing conflict.\nHundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees are being forced\nback, or returning of their own accord and struggling to find\nhousing in the cities where they often settle for jobs, said\nAbdul Baqi Popal, the deputy minister of municipalities.\nThe government has made affordable housing a priority, with\nthe aim of giving 1 million \"Occupancy Certificates\" for\ninformal settlers over the next three years, he said.\n\"The aim is to formalise informal settlements, which are\nlargely on government land. But the government has low financial\nand management capacity to implement the plan, so the pace is\nslow,\" he said on the sidelines of a U.N. urban forum in Penang.\n\"The certificate will give them the right to occupy the plot\nwithout eviction for five years, after which if they meet\ncertain conditions, they can get a land title that gives them\nfull ownership,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nAll certificates will be in the name of both the husband and\nwife - and in the case of widows, the name of the woman, which\nis unusual in Afghanistan, he said.\nFour decades of war have uprooted millions of Afghans from\ntheir homes, and sent them to seek refuge elsewhere in the\ncountry, or in neighbouring Pakistan and Iran.\nAbout 2.4 million displaced Afghans have returned to\nAfghanistan since 2014, according to U.N. estimates.\nReturnees generally experience a deterioration in livelihood\nopportunities and wages after returning to Afghanistan,\naccording to a study published this year by the World Bank and\nthe U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).\nThey also have limited housing options, urban experts said.\nUnder the City For All programme launched in 2016, the\nAfghan government has committed to urban planning and land\nmanagement, including surveying and registering properties in\nurban areas.\nThe government is using mapping tools to collect land data\nand, under a presidential decree issued last year, is\nregistering properties and informal settlements for Occupancy\nCertificates, said Popal, who oversees 165 municipalities.\nMore than 70% of homes in urban areas are informal or\nwithout a title, said Popal, who has previously worked at UNHCR\nand UN-Habitat, the settlements agency.\n\"Giving security of tenure to residents is important for\ntrust building and greater economic stability, because they will\npay taxes, and that will boost government revenue,\" Popal said.\nThe government has a land bank of about 400,000 hectares,\nand plans to allocate some of it to build low-cost housing for\nreturning refugees and migrants from rural areas, he said.\nFunding could come from aid agencies and the private sector.\n\"The country has been in war for four decades - the economy\nis poor, government capacity is limited, our options are few,\"\nhe said.\n\"But with housing and tenure security, people can invest in\ntheir homes, they can make plans, and try to move forward with\ntheir lives,\" he added.\n(Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Michael\nTaylor.

        "text": "By Anastasia Moloney and Christine Murray\nBOGOTA/MEXICO CITY, Oct 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -\nA rgentina is seeking the extradition from Mexico of a former spy\naccused of running a criminal organization that sexually\nexploited women, a move one trafficking survivor said would be a\n\"historic milestone\" in the fight against the crime.\nMexican authorities arrested Raul Martins earlier this month\nin the seaside city of Cancun following an extradition request\nfrom a judge in Argentina, where prosecutors said he faced human\ntrafficking, racketeering and money laundering charges.\nArgentine prosecutors say Martins, who is a dual\nArgentine-Mexican national, exploited women and laundered the\nprofits in at least 10 upscale brothels, cabaret bars and\nnightclubs in Buenos Aires over nearly three decades.\nThe Thomson Reuters Foundation was unable to reach Martins'\nlawyer, Ricardo Hernandez.\nIn interviews with local media, Hernandez is quoted as\nsaying Martins' detention was illegal and that his case was\npolitical ahead of a presidential election in Argentina later\nthis month.\n\"The organization that Raul Martins led has been working, is\nworking, since the 1990s,\" Alejandra Mangano, federal prosecutor\nat Argentina's anti-trafficking prosecutor's office, told the\nThomson Reuters Foundation.\nAlika Kinan, a trafficking survivor who police freed from a\nbrothel in southern Argentina in 2012, said it was significant\nthat someone with links to the government was being sought by\nprosecutors in such a case.\n\"The Raul Martins case is a very important and landmark case\nthat shows the relationship between trafficking mafias and\npolitical power,\" said Kinan, who heads the Alika Kinan\nFoundation that supports trafficking survivors.\n\"We hope the extradition happens because it's going to mark\na historic milestone in the fight against trafficking in this\ncountry.\"\nMartins graduated from Argentina's National Intelligence\nSchool in 1985 and worked at the country's national intelligence\nagency for more than a decade, according to local media reports.\nThe U.S. State Department's 2019 report on human trafficking\nsaid Argentina had \"increased investigations prosecutions, and\nconvictions, including those of complicit officials\", though\nofficial complicity remained \"a significant concern\".\nArgentine prosecutors are investigating possible involvement\nof public officials in paying for sex from women being exploited\nor turning a blind eye to sex trafficking and granting permits\nfor bars where the crime is known to occur.\n\"We believe that in Buenos Aires, and also in other\nprovinces of the country, there are sexual exploitation rings\nthat have important connections in terms of protection allowing\nthem to operate,\" Mangano said.\n\"There are cases where public officials are clients of such\nplaces.\"\nArgentine authorities have convicted 14 public officials\nincluding police and one judicial official on charges of human\ntrafficking since 2008, she said.\n\n'TOP SECRET'\nMartins was \"provisionally detained for extradition\" and is\nbeing held in prison in Mexico City, the office of Mexico's\nattorney general said in a statement, without giving further\ndetails.\nIt is unclear when or whether Martins, who took Mexican\nnationality after settling in the country in the mid-2000s, will\nbe extradited.\nIt takes typically more than a year for extradition requests\nto be decided, according to legal experts.\n\"The federal executive has the discretion to decide whether\nor not to grant the extradition of (Mexican) nationals,\" the\nstatement from the attorney general's office said.\nMangano said most of the brothels Martins is accused of\nrunning in Buenos Aires had since been shut down.\nAt the height of his activity, he ran a string of\nestablishments with names like \"Extra Brut\" and \"Top Secret\".\nMost of those who were sexually exploited were women aged\nfrom 18 to 30 from Argentina and other countries in South\nAmerica, including Paraguay, Colombia and Brazil, she said.\nArgentina's 2008 anti-human trafficking law carries a\nmaximum prison sentence of 50 years, although so far the longest\nsentences handed down have been from 14 to 15 years, Mangano\nsaid.\nThe charges against Martins, 71, involve a criminal\ncomplaint filed by his own daughter, Lorena Martins, who came\nforward in 2011 to detail how the brothels operated, as well as\npeople who worked in the brothels and victims, Mangano said.\n(Reporting by Anastasia Moloney in Bogota, Christine Murray in\nMexico City, additional reporting by Oscar Lopez in Mexico City,\nEditing by Claire Cozens.

The police also\nfroze 42 bank accounts it says were used by the group to finance\ntheir activities.\nAl-Mamun entered Brazil six years ago as a refugee, and was\nliving in Bras, a diverse neighborhood in Sao Paulo that is home\nto immigrants from around the world.\nHe has been indicted on U.S. charges. According to the\nUnited States Department of Justice, Al-Mamun is alleged to have\nhoused people coming from Southeast Asia in S\u00e3o Paulo and\narranged for their travel through a network of smugglers\noperating in Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica,\nNicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico.\nAccording to Brazilian police, he and his group were\nsmuggling into Brazil, and then to the United States, people\nfrom Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan.\nThey were sent to Brazil's northern Acre state to start a\nlong and dangerous trip through Central America all the way to\nthe Mexican border, to cross into the United States.\nReuters was not able to confirm whether Al-Mamun had a\nlawyer in Sao Paulo who could be contacted for comment.\nBrazilian police said the group charged people coming from\nAsia around 50,000 reais ($12,524) for the attempt to reach the\nUnited States. Some would also stay illegally in Brazil, where\nthey were given fraudulent documentation.\nPolice said people suffered violence while waiting in Sao\nPaulo to start the trip north.

        "text": "BANGKOK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - A Thai court of appeal has\nincreased prison time for a former army general and more than\nfifty others convicted in the country's largest human\ntrafficking trial.\nThe case, which involved 103 defendants, began in 2015 after\na crackdown following the gruesome discovery of dozens of\nshallow graves in jungle camps near the Thai-Malaysian border.\nTraffickers had been using the camps to hold mostly Rohingya\nMuslim migrants hostage until their relatives were able to pay\nfor their release, authorities said.\nIn 2017, a criminal court sentenced 62 defendants on 13\ndifferent charges, including trafficking in persons, smuggling\nillegal migrants into the country and organised crime.\nThe appeals court late on Thursday dismissed convictions for\ntwo defendants while increasing the jail terms for 55 others\nwith additional charges of smuggling illegal migrants. Some of\nthese were also given additional prison time for multiple human\ntrafficking charges.\nThose receiving longer sentences include former army\nLieutenant General Manas Kongpan, who saw his 27-year prison\nterm for trafficking and corruption increased to 82 years.\nBanjong Pongphol, an ex-mayor of Padang Besar in Songkhla\nprovince, saw his prison sentence increased to 79 years from 78.\nThe court also upheld the harshest sentence of 94 years for\nSoe Naing, a Rohingya man who the authorities said is a key\nfigure behind the trafficking network. He was found guilty of\nassault causing death and human trafficking.\nThe state prosecutor or the defendants can still lodge an\nappeal against the verdict within 30 days. A further appeal\nwould push the case to the Supreme Court, the final court in the\nThai justice system.\nMyanmar regards Rohingya as illegal migrants from the Indian\nsubcontinent and has confined tens of thousands to sprawling\ncamps in Rakhine state since violence swept the area in 2012.\nThe unrest prompted tens of thousands of Rohingya to flee\nMyanmar by sea. This exodus by boat peaked in 2015, when an\nestimated 25,000 people crossed the Andaman Sea for Thailand,\nMalaysia and Indonesia, many drowning as unsafe and overloaded\nboats capsized.\nWhen violence broke out again in Rakhine state in 2017, more\nthan 700,000 Rohingya crossed into Bangladesh fleeing an army\ncrackdown, according to U.N. agencies.\n(Reporting by Panu Wongcha-um and Panarat Thepgumpanat; Editing\nby Tom Hogue)",

I stay with a friend right now, far\naway from my house because (the broker) lives nearby my place.\nAnisul Islam Mahmud, who chairs a parliamentary committee\nthat monitors the work of the Ministry of Expatriate Welfare and\nOverseas Employment, said that the government needs to spend\nmore money on migrants and \"nurture\" them.\n\"The demand for our female workers is increasing and we have\nto protect them ... the ministry is trying its level best, but\nthere are loopholes. We have to work on filling up these\nloopholes,\" he said.\nBangladesh is one of the world's biggest labour-exporting\ncountries with about 700,000 people finding jobs overseas each\nyear. But recruitment is largely carried out by unofficial\nbrokers, which opens the door to trafficking and exploitation.\nAbout one in 10 migrants are women. Many are uneducated and\npoor and they often receive false promises of salaries of about\n20,000 taka ($237) a month by middlemen and rarely get job\ncontracts - although this is a legal requirement, OKUP said.\nThousands of female migrant workers come home empty-handed\neach year, but only 318 received compensation - averaging 9,200\ntaka each - from the government's Bureau of Manpower Employment\nand Training in 2018, the study found.\nSome 83,000 Bangladeshi women went to work in the Middle\nEast in 2017 - a four-fold increase in two years, following the\nsigning of a labour agreement between Bangladesh and Saudi\nArabia in 2015, government data shows.\nAn increasing number of women have also returned home,\nclaiming mistreatment, according to the charity BRAC, which\nrecorded 1,300 returns in 2018 and 900 so far in 2019, all of\nwhom said they were tortured or abused.\nMany of the women interviewed by OKUP said recruiting agents\nin the Middle East beat, throttled and starved them to force\nthem to return to abusive employers, while their families had to\npay for their journey home.\nBut they rarely go to court because they see the system as\ncorrupt, do not want to be stigmatised for sharing what happened\nto them and fear that their agents will pressurise them to drop\ncases, OKUP said.\nDespite the challenges, Begum, is adamant about seeing the\ncourt process through.\n\"After he beat me up, I am not turning back,\" she said.\n($1 = 84.5000 taka)\n(Reporting by Naimul Karim @Naimonthefield; Editing by Katy\nMigiro.

        "text": "By Sarah  Shearman\nLONDON, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Whether it is\nbuilding schools from plastic waste or opening a cafe staffed by\ntrafficking survivors, social entrepreneurs find innovative and\ncreative ways to solve a diverse range of environmental and\nsocial problems through a business lens.\nAs social entrepreneurship gains traction around the world,\nmisconceptions about the work persist, according to the findings\nof the Thomson Reuters Foundation's second global poll on the\nbest countries for social entrepreneurs.\nThe survey of about 900 social enterprise experts found more\nthan half - or 54% - said the public did not understand what\nthey did. This compared to 58% in the inaugural poll in 2016.\nHere are six frequently asked questions about the sector:\n1. What is a social entrepreneur?\nThere is no universally accepted definition, but broadly a\nsocial entrepreneur can be described as someone who uses\ncommercial strategies to tackle social and environmental\nproblems, prioritising social good while pursuing financial gain\nto sustain their venture and its impact.\n2. Do they run businesses or charities?\nSocial entrepreneurs can structure their organisations as\nnon-profit or for profit. Typically any profits generated from\nthe business are reinvested to advance their stated social cause\nor benefit their community.\n3. When did the term become popular?\nBill Drayton is said to have coined the phrase in the 1980s\nwhen he founded his U.S.-based non-profit Ashoka with the aim of\nsupporting individuals looking to make positive social change\nthough entrepreneurial means.\nSocial entrepreneur started being more widely used in the\n1990s amid a drive by co-operatives and community enterprises\nwanting to use businesses to create social change and an\nincrease in conscious consumerism.\nHowever, over time it has evolved into an umbrella term\noften used to describe a broad range of activities from\nmainstream business that has a social impact to individual\nactivism.\nWithin the sector there is perennial debate over whether a\nmore concrete definition would help or hinder the sector.\n4. Do governments support social entrepreneurs?\nMore nations are considering laws to promote social\nentrepreneurship, with many implementing legal definitions, tax\nincentives and funding to businesses looking to do good.\nBritain has a specific business structure for social\nenterprise, offers tax breaks and this year expanded its law\nincentivising government to buy products and services from\nethical businesses.\nThis year Thailand implemented a law to give tax breaks to\nregistered social enterprises, who commit to reinvesting 70% of\ntheir profits, while Ireland published its first social\nenterprise policy for social enterprises to help build awareness\nand growth.\nWhile government support and recognition are often welcomed,\nthere is continued debate over whether regulation could hamper\ncreativity and innovation within the nascent sector.\n5. How are they funded?\nSocial ventures typically generate income from trading\nproducts or services. Like charities they can seek grant funding\nand, like private companies, they can get investment in various\nforms, such as seed capital or equity.\nThere are many funds designed to specifically help\nbusinesses that deliver social impact, known as impact investing\n\u2013  a fast growing field of finance estimated to amount $502\nbillion, according to Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN), an\nindustry body.\nOther ways that social enterprises can raise funds include\ncrowdfunding, community investment funds and competitions.\n6. What are some of the best known social ventures?\nSome of the most famous social businesses include Grameen\nBank in Bangladesh, Britain's the Big Issue, which hires\nhomeless people to sell streetpapers and sparked a list of\nsimilar organisations globally, and India's Barefoot College,\nwhich aims to improve life in rural villages around the world by\ntraining women skills in solar engineering, healthcare and water\ntesting.\n(Reporting by Sarah Shearman @Shearmans.

        "text": "By Roli Srivastava and Naimul Karim\nSOUTH 24 PARGANAS, India/DHAKA, Oct 9 (Thomson Reuters\nFoundation) - P riya was 15 when a relative in Bangladesh tricked\nher with the promise of a dream job as a singer, drugged her,\nand trafficked her across the border into the sex trade in\nIndia.\nAfter several failed attempts to escape the brothel in the\neastern state of West Bengal where she was trapped for six\nyears, Priya was rescued along with other girls from Bangladesh\nand India in a raid by police and anti-trafficking campaigners.\nHeading home and pursuing her musical ambitions beckoned, or\nso she thought. But three years after her rescue, the prospects\nof making it back to her family appeared ever more distant.\nFor Priya, now 24, was one of about 180 Bangladeshi sex\ntrafficking survivors stuck in shelters in West Bengal - with\nmany having waited years for official clearance to go home due\nto complex and lengthy bureaucracy across the two countries.\n\"How long can I wait?\", said Priya, using her 'brothel name'\nto hide her identity for fear of being shamed in Bangladesh.\n\"Maybe I won't go now even if they ask me to,\" she said last\nmonth at a shelter, sitting in a room adorned with paper roses.\nVictims wishing to return home must first gain approval from\npolice, social workers, judges, border forces and bureaucrats at\nboth state and federal level, a process that involves about 15\nsteps, analysis by the Thomson Reuters Foundation has revealed.\nWhile the two nations are working towards faster returns,\nthe long waits facing dozens of survivors could stymie their\nefforts to start life afresh back home and leave them vulnerable\nto being trafficked again, according to activists.\n\"Living in a shelter ... can be traumatic,\" said Tariqul\nIslam of Justice and Care, a charity that reintegrates victims\nin Bangladesh. \"When they return after two years or more, it\nbecomes hard for them to adjust to the changes and recover.\"\n\"Traffickers often keep track of their victims even after\nthey return home. When they notice that the girl does not have a\njob, or is finding it hard to adjust, they target her again.\"\n\nFASTER RETURNS AFOOT\nThousands of Bangladeshis are trafficked to India each year\n- many of whom are sold into prostitution or domestic servitude\n- anti-slavery activists say, although official data is lacking.\nIn the last eight years, Bangladesh has brought home about\n1,750 trafficking survivors from India, predominantly women and\ngirls in West Bengal and the western state of Maharashtra.\nHowever anti-slavery charities that help victims in India\nsay most are kept in shelters for years - first awaiting the\nconclusion of court proceedings, then the repatriation process.\nJustice is often slow and convictions are rare. One in four\ntrafficking cases in India leads to conviction, while in\nBangladesh, only 30 convictions have been secured under a 2012\nlaw, with more than 4,000 cases still awaiting trial.\nIndia and Bangladesh signed a partnership in 2015 to speed\nup repatriations, but how a victim is treated - whether it is\ntheir experience with the judiciary or the wait to go home -\nvaries from one Indian state to another, according to activists.\nA long-awaited deal aimed at streamlining the system is to\nbe finalised soon, officials from the two governments said.\n\"At the moment it sometimes takes 18 to 22 months,\" said\nFerdousi Akhter, joint secretary with Bangladesh's interior\nministry. Yet charities say it can drag on for up to six years.\n\"A victim has to go through many layers to be repatriated\nfrom India,\" Akhter added. \"We are in talks to cut down these\nlayers ... victims can surely make faster returns.\"\nSLEEPLESS NIGHTS\nIn a small house on the outskirts of Bangladesh's capital\nDhaka, mother-of-two Basiron remembered the call to say her\nmissing daughters had been found in a brothel in India a year\nafter they disappeared.\n\"When I heard the news, I screamed! I felt as though my\nheart was going to burst,\" the 47-year-old single parent said.\nThe girls - now aged 16 and 17 - were rescued in 2017 from a\nbrothel in West Bengal where they were held in one room, beaten,\nplied with drink and drugs until addicted, and repeatedly raped.\nTwo years on, they are still waiting to go home.\nCharges against the 16 people arrested in their trafficking\ncase are yet to be filed in court, which refused them permission\nto return and testify from Bangladesh.\nAt a shelter for trafficking victims in a village in West\nBengal, the two sisters showed off sketches of huts surrounded\nby trees and a river - their way of remembering home.\nThe younger girl, Neela, said she wanted to take out a loan\nand set up a beauty parlour when she finally returns home.\n\"The Indian girls who were rescued with us went back home in\nno time,\" said Neela, whose right arm was covered with scars -\nevidence of self-harm during her time in the brothel.\n\"We feel happy for them. Maybe we too will go back one day.\"\nBasiron and her daughters stay in touch through occasional\nphone calls - they do not discuss the case but talk about meals\nand movies they have enjoyed - yet the mother is losing hope\nover their return and is increasingly worried for their safety.\n\"There are times when I see reports on the news about\nchildren getting kidnapped or killed ... those nights are the\nhardest to sleep,\" said Basiron, who works as a domestic helper.\n\"I haven't seen them in three years. Not even a photo. I\ndon't know what they look like.\"\n\nCASES PENDING\nWest Bengal has a 21-week deadline for a rescued victim to\nbe sent back home but it is rarely met, state officials said,\ndue to lengthy court cases in India and the time it takes\nBangladesh to confirm that a survivor is one of its citizens.\nThat is due to the high volume of cases, the fact that some\nvictims do not share their home addresses for fear of reprisals\nagainst their families, and because relatives cannot always\nidentify them easily after years apart.\nTo ensure faster returns, India has started sharing photos\nof victims with Bangladeshi officials over the past year, having\npreviously just provided their name, sex and age.\nSitting at her desk, state government anti-trafficking\nconsultant Madhumita Haldar showed two photos of a teenage\nBangladeshi victim on her smartphone. In one she was wearing a\nheadscarf, in the other her face was covered in garish make-up.\n\"But how is a parent supposed to recognise their child from\nthis?\" she asked, surrounded by victim case files stacked high.\nMore than 80% of the 180 female trafficking victims in West\nBengal waiting to go home still have not had their nationality\nverified by Bangladesh and some have been waiting for over a\nyear, Haldar said.\nA Bangladeshi officer who declined to be named said police\nnever took more than six weeks to complete the process, despite\nsome delays in verifying victims' addresses.\nYet in one case, a teenage girl died of acute abdominal pain\nthat shelter officials later linked to her withdrawal from\nalcohol and drugs as she waited for her repatriation order to be\ncompleted by Bangladesh, according to activist Tapoti Bhowmick.\n\"Within a day and a half (of her death), all the paperwork\nwas completed and the clearances were in place,\" said Bhowmick\nfrom Sanlaap, an anti-trafficking charity in West Bengal.\n\"Should these girls die to go back to their country?\"\nPriya's story ends more happily.\nWeeks after speaking to the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the\nteenager returned to Bangladesh, having spent nearly nine years\nin India.\nShe is now in another shelter, being cared for by a charity,\nbut is set to return to her family home in the coming weeks.\n\"It feels really good to finally return,\" Priya said by\nphone from the shelter. \"I have forgotten what my house looks\nlike, but I know that I will be able to recognise once I see it.\n\"I just want to go home and see my family.\"\n(Reporting by Roli Srivastava @Rolionaroll and Naimul Karim;\nWriting by Roli Srivastava; Editing by Kieran Guilbert and\nClaire Cozens.

        "text": "By Beh Lih Yi\nKUALA LUMPUR, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A\nMalaysian recruitment agency set to launch a pioneering\n\"ethical\" hiring model has called for an industry overhaul to\ntackle debt bondage among migrant workers and end modern slavery\nin the Southeast Asian nation.\nLed by a team of three women, Kuala Lumpur-based Pinkcollar\nhas billed itself as the first ethical recruitment agency in\nMalaysia, which relies heavily on foreign labourers to fill jobs\nin construction, factories or domestic care.\nThe company will drop the hefty fees usually imposed by\nrecruitment firms on workers for helping them find jobs, an\nindustry-wide policy that has pushed thousands of people into\ncrippling debt they are rarely able to escape.\n\"We are trying to disrupt it (the industry) really,\" founder\nZenna Law told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at Pinkcollar's\noffice ahead of the \"ethical\" scheme's launch on Wednesday.\n\"We are hoping that ... we can elevate the standard of the\nentire industry,\" said Law, who along with her partners is in\nher 20s and was raised with the help of migrant domestic workers\nas a child.\nMalaysia is home to millions of foreign labourers and one of\nthe top destinations in Asia for impoverished women from\ncountries such as Indonesia and the Philippines who take up jobs\nas domestic workers.\nCases of abuse have been widely reported, but migrant rights\ngroups say workers often cannot escape as they have to work to\nrepay the recruiters that found them work and make deductions\nfrom their monthly wages.\nThe Malaysian government said last year it was looking into\nways to cut middlemen and end debt bondage, a form of modern-day\nslavery.\nAlthough it is a first for Malaysia, ethical recruiters have\nsprung up in the Philippines and Hong Kong in recent years as\nbusinesses and private households come under pressure to end\nslavery.\nPinkcollar will focus on domestic workers from the\nPhilippines in its first phase, recruiting through social media\nbefore matching them with employers through interviews that give\nboth parties a say in the hiring process and terms.\nThe hiring fees, which typically range from 12,000 to 18,000\nMalaysian ringgit ($2,900-$4,300), will be payable by the\nemployer, said Pinkcollar's Law.\nThe firm's name is derived from the term given to jobs\nusually held by women - such as nannies and helpers.\n\"When workers owe agencies, not only they have less freedom\nto switch jobs but also to leave bad and unsafe work place. Debt\nbondage is what we are trying to tackle,\" Law said.\nMigrant rights groups welcomed the initiative but warned its\nimplementation could be problematic as countries such as\nIndonesia would only allow workers to go abroad through its\nlocally-approved agencies.\n\"It could be quite chaotic for the sending country because\nthey want to monitor the whereabouts of the workers,\" said Alex\nOng from advocacy group Migrant Care, which campaigns for\nmigrant workers in Malaysia.\nRecruitment agencies are not allowed to charge workers in\nthe formal sectors - such as manufacturing and plantation - fees\nthat are higher one month's salary, under current guidelines set\nby the employers' group, the Malaysian Employers' Federation.\nBut domestic workers are excluded from the clause, and\ntypically have to spend six months with almost all their wages\ndeducted to cover the costs they owe the recruiters for local\ntravel or medical tests, said Ong.\n\"The question is why this protection is not applicable for\ndomestic workers too,\" asked Ong, calling for a legal reform.\nMalaysia is home to an estimated 212,000 of about 40 million\npeople trapped in modern slavery worldwide, according to the\nGlobal Slavery Index by human rights group Walk Free Foundation.\n($1 = 4.1910 ringgit)\n(Reporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi; Editing by Michael Taylor.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

        "text": "By Emma Batha\nLONDON, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - An estimated 10\nto 15 million people are not recognised as nationals by any\ncountry, often depriving them of basic rights most of the world\ntakes for granted such as education, healthcare, housing and\njobs.\nThe U.N. refugee agency is hosting a major intergovernmental\nmeeting in Geneva on Monday to assess progress at the midpoint\nof its #Ibelong campaign which aims to end statelessness by\n2024. Here are examples of stateless populations:\n\nMYANMAR/BANGLADESH: In 1982, Buddhist-majority Myanmar\npassed a citizenship law that effectively rendered stateless\nmost Rohingya, who are Muslim and of South Asian descent.\nEthnic violence has driven many to leave, but hundreds of\nthousands remain in Myanmar. There are about 900,000 Rohingya in\nneighbouring Bangladesh and smaller populations across Asia.\nSome are sold into slavery on fishing boats and plantations.\n\nIVORY COAST: Ivory Coast is home to 692,000 stateless\npeople. Many are descended from migrants from neighbouring\ncountries who were encouraged to work on Ivory Coast's coffee\nand cotton plantations in the 20th century.\nAt least a quarter of Ivory Coast's population is estimated\nto be of foreign descent, and the question of who is or is not\nIvorian helped fuel two civil wars in the West African country.\n\nTHAILAND: Nearly 479,000 people are stateless, including\nmembers of ethnic hill tribes such as the Yao, Hmong and Karen\nwho live in the mountainous border with Myanmar and Laos, and\nthe semi-nomadic \"Sea Gypsies\" along the Andaman coast.\n\nESTONIA/LATVIA: When the Soviet Union broke up, many ethnic\nRussians remained in the new Baltic states and were defined as\n\"non-citizens\".\nNearly 221,000 stateless people live in Latvia and 78,000 in\nEstonia, mainly ethnic Russians who have trouble obtaining\ncitizenship and at times face discrimination.\n\nSYRIA: In 1962, many Kurds in the northeast were stripped of\ncitizenship, a move Human Rights Watch described as part of a\nplan to \"Arabise\" the resource-rich region.\nBefore the civil war, there were an estimated 300,000\nstateless Kurds in Syria, many of whom were promised nationality\nby President Bashar al-Assad in reaction to the 2011 uprising.\nU.N. data suggests the number fell to 160,000, but this may\nbe partly because many fled the war.\nHuman rights experts have warned that babies born to Syrian\nrefugee women in Lebanon and Jordan could end up stateless.\n\nKUWAIT: Stateless people are known as Bidoon, which is short\nfor bidoon jinsiya meaning \"without nationality\" in Arabic. Some\ntrace their origins to nomadic tribes that once moved freely\naround the Gulf region.\nThere are about 92,000 Bidoon in Kuwait, according to U.N.\ndata, but some estimates are much higher. They are often barred\nfrom free education, healthcare and many jobs.\n\nNEPAL: Although Nepal says it does not have a stateless\npopulation, experts on statelessness believe many people,\npossibly hundreds of thousands, may be affected.\nPart of the problem derives from a law banning women married\nto foreigners from passing their nationality to their children.\nThere is also a stateless population of people who were expelled\nby Bhutan in the 1990s.\n\nDOMINICAN REPUBLIC: A 2013 court ruling, along with earlier\nchanges to nationality laws aimed at tackling illegal migration,\nhas left many stateless, mostly people of Haitian descent who\nwere born in Dominican Republic.\nIn 2015, there were about 134,000 stateless people,\naccording to U.N. data, but the figures are being updated.\n\nIRAQ: There are about 47,500 stateless people who include\nBidoon and Faili Kurds, an ethnic group that historically live\nboth sides of the Iraq-Iran border.\nMore than 100,000 Faili Kurds had their nationality revoked\nin 1980 under the Ba'ath regime. Although many have since had\ntheir nationality reinstated, others remain stateless.\n\nEUROPE: Tens of thousands of stateless Roma - an ethnic\ngroup with origins in India - are thought to live in central,\neastern and southern Europe. With the break-up of Czechoslovakia\nand Yugoslavia, successor states claimed they belonged\nelsewhere.\nOther Roma in Kosovo and Bosnia have become stateless due to\nwar-time displacement.\nRoma are often unable to register their children's births or\nhold official property titles. This can make it hard to prove\nwhere they are from.\n\nVENEZUELA: Some children born to Venezuelan parents who have\nfled to other countries amid a political and economic crisis at\nhome are at increased risk of statelessness.\n(Reporting by Emma Batha @emmabatha, Editing by Claire Cozens.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

        "text": "By Naimul Karim\nDHAKA, Oct 4 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Bangladesh has\nsuspended the passports of five citizens suspected of running a\ntrafficking ring involving hundreds of workers in Brunei and\nasked the government there to deport them, a senior diplomat\nsaid on Friday.\nBangladesh's top diplomat in Brunei said he had received\nrepeated complaints from workers who had paid thousands of\ndollars to be taken to the wealthy Southeast Asian nation on the\npromise of jobs that never materialised.\n\"They keep bringing more people even though there are no\njobs,\" Bangladesh's High Commissioner to Brunei Mahmud Hussain\ntold the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\"It's like a flesh business. There can't be a bigger\ncriminal activity than this.\"\nHussain said the government was taking the rare step of\nsuspending their passports in order to trigger their deportation\nand stop them from operating in Brunei.\n\"We call most of these brokers to the embassy to solve the\nproblem, but many of these brokers don't even care. They don't\ncome,\" he said.\n\"We thought we needed to take a strong action against these\nbrokers. We needed to show them that you can't continuously do\nthis crime and get away.\"\nBangladeshis were being charged about $4,000 by agents who\neither failed to get them any work at all or made them work for\nvery low pay, Hussain said.\nHannan Sikdar, 22, sold his family's land to raise the\n$3,500 that he paid a broker in Bangladesh for a job in Brunei.\n\"I was told that I would earn so much that I would be able\nto send 25,000 takas ($300) back home every month,\" Sikdar said\nfrom Brunei by phone.\nAfter reaching Brunei, Sikdar went to work for a week, then\nwas told not to come again. The agent told him he would have to\nfind a new job himself and threatened to have him deported\nunless he handed over a portion of his monthly salary.\n\"In the last five months, I only managed to send 35,000 taka\nback home. I would have earned a lot more in Bangladesh,\" said\nSikdar.\nMost of the about 25,000 Bangladeshis in Brunei, a former\nBritish protectorate of about 400,000 people, are either\nemployed in the construction industry or own businesses and only\na minority are exploited, the High Commission said.\nBangladesh is one of the world's biggest labour-exporting\ncountries and numbers are increasing. At least 1 million\nBangladeshis secured jobs overseas in 2017, the highest number\never recorded by the government.\nBut the country's recruitment system depends largely on\nunlicensed brokers working in rural areas and opens the door to\ntrafficking and cheating.\nMigrant activist Shakirul Islam welcomed the government's\nmove against the suspected human traffickers and said\ntrafficking cases should be filed against them.\n\"If cases are not filed, our relationship with Brunei in\nterms of sending workers will take a hit,\" said Islam, executive\ndirector of Ovibashi Karmi Unnayan Program, a migrant rights\norganisation.\nBoth Bangladesh and Brunei are on a U.S. State Department\nwatchlist over their human trafficking record, putting them at\nrisk of a downgrade that would trigger sanctions limiting access\nto international aid.\n(Reporting by Naimul Karim @Naimonthefield; Editing by Claire\nCozens.

The police also\nfroze 42 bank accounts it says were used by the group to finance\ntheir activities.\nAl-Mamun entered Brazil six years ago as a refugee, and was\nliving in Bras, a diverse neighborhood in Sao Paulo that is home\nto immigrants from around the world.\nHe has been indicted on U.S. charges. According to the\nUnited States Department of Justice, Al-Mamun is alleged to have\nhoused people coming from Southeast Asia in S\u00e3o Paulo and\narranged for their travel through a network of smugglers\noperating in Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica,\nNicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico.\nAccording to Brazilian police, he and his group were\nsmuggling into Brazil, and then to the United States, people\nfrom Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan.\nThey were sent to Brazil's northern Acre state to start a\nlong and dangerous trip through Central America all the way to\nthe Mexican border, to cross into the United States.\nReuters was not able to confirm whether Al-Mamun had a\nlawyer in Sao Paulo who could be contacted for comment.\nBrazilian police said the group charged people coming from\nAsia around 50,000 reais ($12,524) for the attempt to reach the\nUnited States. Some would also stay illegally in Brazil, where\nthey were given fraudulent documentation.\nPolice said people suffered violence while waiting in Sao\nPaulo to start the trip north.

        "text": "By Michael Taylor\nKUALA LUMPUR, Oct 31 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The\namount of planet-warming carbon emitted by the world's lost\ntropical forests has been under-reported as estimates failed to\ntake into account the longer-term effects of tree destruction,\nresearchers said.\nA new international study re-evaluated the carbon impacts of\nforests that were destroyed or degraded between 2000 and 2013,\nadding up to 49 million hectares (121 million acres), roughly\nthe size of Spain.\nThe carbon released from losses to those \"intact forests\"\nwill amount to more than six times previous estimates when\nadditional emissions caused by changes to the forest up to 2050\nare included, it found.\nIntact forests are large areas of continuous forest with no\nsigns of intensive human activity, like agriculture or logging.\n\"Once you've caused the initial round of damage, you have\ncommitted to a lot of further emissions in the future once the\nforest has opened up,\" said study co-author Tom Evans of the New\nYork-based Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS).\n\"It's a bit like if you're injured at work you have lost\nearnings for years into the future,\" he told the Thomson Reuters\nFoundation. \"Those carbon lost earnings turn out to be the\nbiggest part of the picture for these intact forests.\"\nTrees suck carbon dioxide from the air, and store carbon,\nthe main greenhouse gas heating up the Earth's climate. But they\nrelease it when they are cut down and are burned or rot.\nEnvironmentalists say protecting existing forests and\nrestoring damaged ones prevents flooding, limits climate change\nand protects biodiversity.\nThe tropics lost 12 million hectares of tree cover in 2018,\nthe fourth-highest annual loss since records began in 2001,\naccording to forest monitoring service Global Forest Watch.\nOf greatest concern, it said, was the disappearance of 3.6\nmillion hectares of old-growth rainforest, an area the size of\nBelgium, much due to fires, land-clearing for farms and mining.\nAreas analysed in the new study, published in the journal\nScience Advances, included intact forests lost in the Amazon and\nCongo basins and on Southeast Asia's islands.\nWhile previous research largely focused on stored carbon\nlosses directly linked to deforestation, the new study also took\ninto account the knock-on and future effects.\nThose include indiscriminate logging around newly opened up\nforest areas as they become more accessible and a rise in\nhunting that limits the spread of seeds and hinders forest\nregeneration.\nOver time, the carbon-storing abilities of the new forest\nedges created by deforestation also decline as human and grazing\nactivities increase and temperatures change.\n\"Once you open up a forest, there are several forms of\ndamage that lead to that dwindling of carbon stocks,\" said\nEvans, adding that undamaged forests also become more\ncarbon-rich each year.\nThese effects tend to get overlooked in carbon accounting\nused to work out how and where to target conservation incentives\nand provide payments for preventing forest loss, he added.\nIn 2013, the world had about 549 million hectares of intact\ntropical forests left, the study said.\nEnsuring their future should now be a priority, with\nincreased efforts and policies to keep them safe, Evans said.\nThat should include better recognition of indigenous land\nrights and a halt to the expansion of mining, fossil fuel\nextraction, agriculture and infrastructure which often drives\nforest loss, he added.\n\"Our results revealed that continued destruction of intact\ntropical forests is a ticking time bomb for carbon emissions,\"\nthe study's lead author Sean Maxwell, a scientist with\nAustralia's University of Queensland, said in a statement.\n\"There is an urgent need to safeguard these landscapes\nbecause they play an indispensable role in stabilising the\nclimate.\"\n(Reporting by Michael Taylor @MickSTaylor; editing by Megan\nRowling.

He also cited growing public awareness of the\nfood production process as well as issues such as child labor\nand deforestation, which is especially pertinent in Brazil.\nMeat production, particularly beef, is a significant\ncontributor to carbon emissions that scientists blame for global\nwarming.\n\"We work constantly in the reformulation of our products,\"\nthe executive told reporters ahead of an event in Sao Paulo with\nuniversity students from the four countries in the Mercosur\ntrade bloc:  Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. It is part\nof a career training program sponsored by the company.\nFreixe also said public awareness is growing around the\nworld regarding raw materials used to produce food. This poses a\nchallenge for every large food processor.\n\"There is a lot more sensitivy on the matter everywhere, not\nonly in Europe or the U.S. We are in a connected world, people\nhave access to information, consumers want to know where raw\nmaterials come from, if they were produced ethically,\" he said.\nNestl\u00e9 is a major buyer worldwide of coffee, sugar, cocoa\nand milk, among other commodities. It is a significant buyer of\nBrazilian coffee and sugar.\nThe company says it clearly states to suppliers that it does\nnot buy raw materials that were produced in recently deforested\nareas or where child labor has been reported.\n\"The question mark is how to make that happen? Because there\nare millions of farmers in so many countries,\" the executive\nsaid. \"When there is an indication of a problem, we investigate.\nIf confirmed, we cut the supplier,\" he added.\nForest fires and deforestation in the Amazon, the world's\nlargest rainforest, jumped sharply this year, causing a wave of\nworldwide criticism regarding how the local government is\nmanaging the situation.\nGlobal food companies were also pressed by consumers and\nactivists to avoid sourcing commodities from places where\nforests were recently cleared.\n(Editing by David Gregorio)",

        "text": "By Marcelo Teixeira\nSAO PAULO, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Nestl\u00e9 SA, one of the\nworld's largest food processors, believes population growth will\nrequire human diets to adapt, reducing consumption of sugar,\nsalt and meat products, an executive said on Wednesday.\n\"We have 7.5 billion people and the population continues to\ngrow, so there is a need to eat more vegetables, cereals, and\nless sugar, meat products,\" said Laurent Freixe, Executive Vice\nPresident and head of operations in the Americas.\nLimited natural resources on the planet and the growing\npublic health problem of obesity are behind the changes Freixe\nsees as necessary. He also cited growing public awareness of the\nfood production process as well as issues such as child labor\nand deforestation, which is especially pertinent in Brazil.\nMeat production, particularly beef, is a significant\ncontributor to carbon emissions that scientists blame for global\nwarming.\n\"We work constantly in the reformulation of our products,\"\nthe executive told reporters ahead of an event in Sao Paulo with\nuniversity students from the four countries in the Mercosur\ntrade bloc:  Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. It is part\nof a career training program sponsored by the company.\nFreixe also said public awareness is growing around the\nworld regarding raw materials used to produce food. This poses a\nchallenge for every large food processor.\n\"There is a lot more sensitivy on the matter everywhere, not\nonly in Europe or the U.S. We are in a connected world, people\nhave access to information, consumers want to know where raw\nmaterials come from, if they were produced ethically,\" he said.\nNestl\u00e9 is a major buyer worldwide of coffee, sugar, cocoa\nand milk, among other commodities. It is a significant buyer of\nBrazilian coffee and sugar.\nThe company says it clearly states to suppliers that it does\nnot buy raw materials that were produced in recently deforested\nareas or where child labor has been reported.\n\"The question mark is how to make that happen? Because there\nare millions of farmers in so many countries,\" the executive\nsaid. \"When there is an indication of a problem, we investigate.\nIf confirmed, we cut the supplier,\" he added.\nForest fires and deforestation in the Amazon, the world's\nlargest rainforest, jumped sharply this year, causing a wave of\nworldwide criticism regarding how the local government is\nmanaging the situation.\nGlobal food companies were also pressed by consumers and\nactivists to avoid sourcing commodities from places where\nforests were recently cleared.\n(Editing by David Gregorio)",

People are having their homes and rights\ntaken away,\" she said.\nWhile its Supreme Court ruled in June that homophobia and\ntransphobia are crimes, Brazil remains a deeply religious\ncountry where both the Catholic Church and the popular\nevangelical Christian movement frequently criticize gay rights.\nIt is also one of the world\u2019s deadliest countries for LGBT+\npeople, with 320 gay and trans people murdered there last year,\naccording to watchdog group Grupo Gay da Bahia.\nLGBT+ rights campaigners welcomed Time's announcement as\ncoming at a particularly precarious time.\n\"I think it\u2019s extremely important,\u201d said lawyer and activist\nLuis Arruda.\n\"She brings an incredible visibility for the LGBT+ issue.\nNot just in Brazil but internationally,\u201d Arruda said of Vittar.\nOn taking office in January, ex-army officer Bolsonaro cut\nLGBT+ concerns from the human rights ministry's\nresponsibilities and announced plans to purge all references to\nhomosexuality, feminism or violence against women from school\ntextbooks.\nThe conservative leader also pushed to have funding for\nfilms, including a handful of LGBT-themed projects, suspended by\nthe national film agency, a move that was blocked by a judge\nearlier this week.\nAmid this crackdown, Vittar has become a rising global gay\nicon, performing at World Pride in New York in June this year\nand at Rio\u2019s carnival festivities last year.\nArruda said the visibility of Vittar and other openly gay\nartists in Brazil is now more important than ever.\n\"Despite Bolsonaro, there's a lot going on in parallel,\u201d\nArruda said. \"Censorship is very strong here, it\u2019s very\ndifficult. But  people are still fighting.\"\nIt was the second time this year that Time has included an\nLGBT+ advocate from Brazil on its list, with openly gay\ncongressman David Miranda named in the May edition.\n\"Congratulations beautiful, you really deserve this\nrecognition,\u201d Miranda wrote on Vittar\u2019s Instagram page.\nOthers on the list include Moroccan feminist and comic\nartist Zainab Fasiki and American opera singer Davone Tines.\n(Reporting by Oscar Lopez, editing by Chris Michaud.

        "text": "By Oscar Lopez\nMEXICO CITY, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When an\nAvengers comic featuring a gay kiss was banned from Brazil's\nlargest book festival, author Nana Queiroz stuffed copies of her\nlatest bestseller into a suitcase in a bid to outwit\nauthorities' latest move to silence LGBT+ storytellers.\n\"I decided that if they didn't allow us to sell the books at\nthe fair, I would go on the streets and do it there,\" said\nQueiroz, who was promoting \"Eu, Travesti\" or \"I, Transvestite\"\nco-written with transvestite activist Luisa Marilac.\nIn the end, Brazil's highest court ruled that banning books\nover LGBT+ content was illegal and Queiroz was able to sell her\nbook without it being confiscated by officials from the mayor's\noffice in Rio de Janeiro.\nBut the incident has given impetus to artists, politicians\nand lawyers to push back against efforts to stop LGBT+ stories\nbeing told, which have intensified since self-proclaimed \"proud\"\nhomophobe, President Jair Bolsonaro came to power in January.\n\"This type of state intervention into culture has been\nnormalised, which is very worrying,\" said Renan Quinalha, a law\nprofessor at the Federal University of Sao Paulo.\nAlthough same-sex marriage has been legal in Brazil since\n2013, it is a deeply religious country where homophobia is\ncommon and both the Catholic Church and the popular evangelical\nChristian movement frequently criticise gay rights.\nIt is also one of the most dangerous countries in the world\nfor LGBT+ people, with 320 gay and trans people murdered last\nyear, according to watchdog group Grupo Gay da Bahia.\nUpon assuming office, ex-army officer Bolsonaro removed\nLGBT+ concerns from the responsibilities of the human rights\nministry and announced plans to delete from school textbooks all\nreferences to homosexuality, feminism or violence against women.\n\"I was born in (1985) the year that the dictatorship fell\nhere in Brazil,\" Queiroz told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \"I\nthought I would never have to face censorship again in this\ncountry. But here we are, fighting.\"\n\nNEVER AGAIN\nAfter September's attempted Rio comic book ban, about 70\nauthors and editors signed a manifesto opposing censorship which\nread, \"We don't need someone to tell us what we can read, think,\nwrite, speak or how we should relate to each other\".\nSome 200 opposition politicians also launched a cross-party\ninitiative to improve literacy among ordinary Brazilians by\npushing for more investment in public libraries and realisation\nof a 2010 law requiring all schools to have libraries by 2020.\nThey are holding public hearings, meetings and seminars\nacross the country to encourage reading and ensure more people\nhave access to books across Brazil.\nThe lawmakers also published a \"manifesto against\ncensorship\", condemning the incident in Rio as \"another attempt\nto hold Brazil hostage to a ... reactionary, outdated political\nway of thinking\".\n\"We've seen an escalation in this authoritarian government\nwith very serious cases of censorship,\" said Fernanda\nMelchionna, a deputy with the Socialism and Liberty Party.\n\"That's why we decided at the last minute to launch this\nmanifesto so that we could say: censorship - never again.\"\nSMOKESCREEN\nThe courts are proving a key arena for Brazil's battle over\ngay and trans rights, which pits a growing population of young,\neducated urban liberals against religious conservatives who say\nLGBT+ expression goes against traditional Brazilian values.\nPro-gay activists scored a victory on Monday when a federal\njudge ordered the government to reinstate R$ 70 million ($17.13\nmillion) in funding for about 80 films, including four which\ndealt with LGBT+ themes, which it froze in August.\nIn a separate case, five LGBT+ groups filed a motion against\nthe president last month, arguing that the removal of the film\nfunding was homophobic and transphobic, after the Supreme Court\nin June criminalised homophobia and transphobia.\nPaulo Iotti, a lawyer involved in the ongoing case, said the\ngovernment was using LGBT+ people \"as a smokescreen to polarise\nsociety\" and divert public attention from the nation's soaring\ncrime, moribund economy and entrenched political corruption.\nDespite Bolsonaro's success in tapping into Brazilian anger\nover nearly a decade and a half of leftist rule, opinion polls\nshow his popularity is already waning, as his government has\nlurched from one scandal to the next.\nAnti-gay voices gained prominence in 2017, when the Free\nBrazil Movement - a conservative group behind street protests\nthat helped impeach leftist President Dilma Rousseff in 2016 -\ngot an LGBT+ art show shut down in southern Porto Alegre city.\nThe exhibition, called Queermuseu, eventually travelled to\nRio despite attempts by mayor Marcelo Crivella - who banned the\nAvengers comic and is also a former evangelical bishop - to\nblock what he called \"an exhibition of pedophilia\".\nBolsonaro - who was a congressman for Rio de Janeiro state\nat the time - said Queermuseu's organisers \"should be shot\".\nFollowing Monday's legal victory in ordering ANCINE, the\ncountry's film agency, to resume its working giving out grants,\ndirector Emerson Maranhao - who testified in the case - said he\nwas determined to fight on.\nWhile the judge issued an injunction against the freezing of\nfunds, it is only a temporary measure that can be reviewed by\nhigher courts.\n\"We will not allow totalitarianism to take hold,\" said\nMaranhao, who is hoping to get funding from ANCINE to make a\nfive-part series, \"Transversais\", about five transgender people\nin Brazil, which was publically criticised by Bolsonaro.\n\"We live in a democratic state - things cannot go on like\nthis ... We have to act.\"\nAs for author Queiroz, promoting tolerance in the next\ngeneration is now more critical than ever.\n\"I'm going to make a poster of this (comic book) kiss and\nput it on my own son's wall,\" she said.\n(Reporting by Oscar Lopez, additional reporting by Fabio\nTeixeira in Rio de Janeiro, editing by Katy Migiro.

        "text": "By Emma Batha\nLONDON, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - As a teenager\ngrowing up in Lebanon Maha Mamo lived in constant terror of\ncheckpoints, but her only crime was to be born stateless.\nWith no documents to prove who she was, Mamo feared she\ncould be arrested and locked up indefinitely.\nLike other stateless people, she was deprived of basic\nrights most people take for granted.\nEverything from going to school or getting a job to even\nenjoying a night out with friends was fraught with difficulties.\nOn Monday, Mamo will tell her story to film star Cate\nBlanchett at the opening of a major intergovernmental meeting on\nstatelessness in Geneva.\nCharismatic, down-to-earth and fluent in five languages,\nMamo has become a powerful voice in #Ibelong, a campaign to\neradicate statelessness which is estimated to affect about 10\nmillion people worldwide.\n\"For most people a passport is a travel document, but for me\nit means everything,\" said Mamo, who became a Brazilian national\nlast year and now speaks at international events draped in a\nBrazilian flag.\n\"It means I exist. It's finally a sign I belong somewhere.\"\n\n'MASSIVE IMPACT'\nMamo's fate was sealed before she was born when her\nChristian father and Muslim mother fell in love in Syria.\nInterfaith marriages were banned so they eloped to neighbouring\nLebanon where she, her sister Souad and brother Eddy were born.\n\"You can only be Lebanese if your father is Lebanese, and we\ncouldn't be Syrian because our parents' marriage was illegal, so\nwe grew up stateless,\" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\"It has had a massive impact all my life. I had many\nchallenges every day. I was afraid of every single thing.\"\nMamo was rejected by many schools before eventually being\naccepted by an Armenian school which took pity on the family.\nA talented basketball player, she was scouted by\nprofessional coaches who believed she had potential to play on\nthe national team - until they realised she had no documents.\n\"That was when my world came crashing down,\" she said. \"This\nwas the first moment when the deprivations really hit home. But\nas a teenager I didn't yet understand how big my problem was.\"\nDespite good school grades, her applications to study\nmedicine at university were also rejected.\nHealth care was another obstacle. To get urgent hospital\ntreatment for a severe allergy Mamo was forced to pretend to be\nher best friend.\nWith no papers, even the most mundane things became a\nlogistical nightmare.\n\"There are simple things you would never imagine that are so\nimpossible; buying a sim card, getting a loan, having a library\ncard or even going to a club to dance with your friends or\ncelebrate a birthday,\" she said.\n\"If they ask for ID you have to give up and go home.\"\nIn Lebanon, there was the added danger posed by checkpoints.\n\"If the police stop you then you are going to jail just\nbecause you don't have documents,\" she said.\n\"Every time I saw one I had to run the other way just\nbecause my existence itself was illegal.\"\n\nNEW BEGINNING\nDesperate for a solution to her predicament, Mamo sent her\nstory to presidents, ministers and any organisation she thought\nmight be able to help - and was met with a wall of silence.\nBut in 2014 Brazil offered to take Mamo and her siblings\nunder a new humanitarian visa programme it had launched to help\nSyrians fleeing war.\n\"I went to Brazil not as a stateless person, but as a\nrefugee. I only knew two things about Brazil - the football and\nthe carnival,\" said Mamo, now 31 and fluent in Portuguese.\nHer arrival in Brazil coincided with the launch of the\nUnited Nations' #Ibelong campaign aimed at ending statelessness\nin a decade.\n\"For me, my brother and sister that was the hope. In 10\nyears we would have the chance to be a person, a human being,\"\nsaid Mamo.\nBut she did not have to wait that long. In 2017, Brazil\nchanged its law to recognise stateless people and provide a\nroute to naturalisation.\nLast year Mamo and her sister became the first stateless\npeople in Brazil to be granted citizenship.\nMamo, who is writing a book about her life, recalls vividly\nthe moment when she was presented with her Brazilian passport -\nending 30 years in limbo.\n\"I started shaking and crying,\" she said. \"I did not believe\nwhat was happening, that this was my moment when I'm born again\nand my life would totally change.\"\nHowever, the ceremony was bittersweet because her brother\ncould not share in her joy.\nJust weeks after being granted asylum in Brazil, Eddy had\nbeen killed in a street robbery.\n\"I couldn't make his dream come true, I couldn't make him a\ncitizen of this world,\" said Mamo. \"He died a stateless person.\"\n(Reporting by Emma Batha @emmabatha; Editing by Claire Cozens.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

        "text": "BANGKOK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - A Thai court of appeal has\nincreased prison time for a former army general and more than\nfifty others convicted in the country's largest human\ntrafficking trial.\nThe case, which involved 103 defendants, began in 2015 after\na crackdown following the gruesome discovery of dozens of\nshallow graves in jungle camps near the Thai-Malaysian border.\nTraffickers had been using the camps to hold mostly Rohingya\nMuslim migrants hostage until their relatives were able to pay\nfor their release, authorities said.\nIn 2017, a criminal court sentenced 62 defendants on 13\ndifferent charges, including trafficking in persons, smuggling\nillegal migrants into the country and organised crime.\nThe appeals court late on Thursday dismissed convictions for\ntwo defendants while increasing the jail terms for 55 others\nwith additional charges of smuggling illegal migrants. Some of\nthese were also given additional prison time for multiple human\ntrafficking charges.\nThose receiving longer sentences include former army\nLieutenant General Manas Kongpan, who saw his 27-year prison\nterm for trafficking and corruption increased to 82 years.\nBanjong Pongphol, an ex-mayor of Padang Besar in Songkhla\nprovince, saw his prison sentence increased to 79 years from 78.\nThe court also upheld the harshest sentence of 94 years for\nSoe Naing, a Rohingya man who the authorities said is a key\nfigure behind the trafficking network. He was found guilty of\nassault causing death and human trafficking.\nThe state prosecutor or the defendants can still lodge an\nappeal against the verdict within 30 days. A further appeal\nwould push the case to the Supreme Court, the final court in the\nThai justice system.\nMyanmar regards Rohingya as illegal migrants from the Indian\nsubcontinent and has confined tens of thousands to sprawling\ncamps in Rakhine state since violence swept the area in 2012.\nThe unrest prompted tens of thousands of Rohingya to flee\nMyanmar by sea. This exodus by boat peaked in 2015, when an\nestimated 25,000 people crossed the Andaman Sea for Thailand,\nMalaysia and Indonesia, many drowning as unsafe and overloaded\nboats capsized.\nWhen violence broke out again in Rakhine state in 2017, more\nthan 700,000 Rohingya crossed into Bangladesh fleeing an army\ncrackdown, according to U.N. agencies.\n(Reporting by Panu Wongcha-um and Panarat Thepgumpanat; Editing\nby Tom Hogue)",

        "text": "By Beh Lih Yi\nKUALA LUMPUR, Oct 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -\nT echnology could help Myanmar fight a rise in rape cases, said\nan award-winning entrepreneur who is using augmented reality to\nbring sex education to the socially conservative country.\nThe rape in May of a three-year-old girl at a private\nnursery in Myanmar has sparked outrage, prompting thousands to\ntake to the streets to demand justice and highlighting a paucity\nof sex education in the country.\nIt came as the overall number of rape cases in Myanmar\nsurged from 1,100 cases in 2016 to more than 1,500 in 2018,\nnearly two-thirds involving a child, according to local media\nquoting government data.\n\"The case was obvious evidence that we are lacking sex\neducation,\" said Hla Hla Win, a former English teacher who\nfounded Myanmar-based 360ed, a social enterprise that seeks to\nrevamp education with technology.\n\"It broke the hearts of so many parents but it was also a\nwake-up call that we can no longer see sex education as a\ntaboo,\" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from\nMyanmar's biggest city Yangon on Wednesday.\nThe 38-year-old Harvard graduate was named one of 40 social\nentrepreneurs of the year by the World Economic Forum in New\nYork last month for her work in transforming the way hundreds of\nthousands of students learn in Myanmar.\nKey to her work is augmented reality (AR): ever more popular\nglobally in everything from arts to flight training. Under AR,\ndigital images are superimposed on reality to create a rich,\ninteractive experience that combines real and virtual worlds.\nIn Myanmar, 360ed uses AR in a series of apps it has\ndeveloped since 2016 to help students better visualise complex\nsubjects such as chemistry and biology.\nHer project on sex education, named \"Bay Kin\" or \"Danger\nFree\", was launched in August soon after the child-rape case\nignited national debate about sex, safety, children and consent.\nThe product includes a series of sex education books - in\nboth paper and AR formats - as well as comics and games, that\nteach students about everything from sex organs to pregnancy.\n\"As a mother and a teacher, I'm keen on this topic because\nmany teenagers are curious about it but we don't have a tool to\nteach them,\" said Hla Hla Win, who has a four-year-old daughter.\n\"A lot of teenagers in Myanmar thought pregnancy could just\nhappen from sharing a same glass of water with the opposite\nsex,\" she added.\nSo far about 100 schools have partnered with 360ed to use\nits sex education books; now it is working with teachers to roll\nout the AR technology.\n\"We're in the early stage because many teachers still feel\nembarrassed to teach sex in schools but AR is fun, so we hope it\ncan help to overcome this,\" said Hla Hla Win.\nThe three-year-old girl, nicknamed Victoria, testified via\nvideo link at a trial last month after a school employee was\ncharged with raping her. The case has been a lightning rod for\npopular protest in Myanmar, be it over the many nurseries that\nlack licences or the hasty way police handled investigations.\nChild rapists face a maximum life imprisonment if convicted.\n(Reporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi; Editing by Lyndsay\nGriffiths.

        "text": "(Repeats for clients in Asia.)\nBy Tom Allard\nBANGKOK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - He is Asia\u2019s most-wanted man. He\nis protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private\njet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night\nat a Macau casino.\nTse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected\nof leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate\nformed out of an alliance of five of Asia\u2019s triad groups,\naccording to law enforcement officials. Its members call it\nsimply \u201cThe Company.\u201d Police, in a nod to one of Tse\u2019s\nnicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for \u201cBrother Number\nThree.\u201d\nThe syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of\nmethamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen\ncountries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South\nPacific. But meth \u2013 a highly addictive drug with devastating\nphysical and mental effects on long-term users \u2013 is its main\nbusiness, they say.\nIn what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations\nOffice on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s\nmeth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be\nas high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the\ncartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a\n40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has\nexpanded at least fourfold in the past five years.\nThis unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an\nunprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the\nprime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously\nunreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the\nAustralian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about\n20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far\nthe biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug\ntrafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in\nthe investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar,\nChina, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan,\nwhile not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the\ninvestigation.\nA document containing AFP profiles of the operation\u2019s top 19\nsyndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the\nleader of the syndicate. According to the document, the\norganization has \u201cbeen connected with or directly involved in at\nleast 13 cases\u201d of drug trafficking since January 2015. The\ndocument does not provide specific details of the cases.\nA Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the\n\u201cMultinational CEO\u201d of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement\nAdministration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional\ngovernment agencies says Tse is \u201cbelieved to be\u201d the leader of\nthe Sam Gor syndicate.\nPolice have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected\nboss of the trafficking group.\nSome investigators say that the scope of the syndicate\u2019s\noperation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin\nAmerica\u2019s most legendary narco-traffickers. \u201cTse Chi Lop is in\nthe league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,\u201d said Jeremy\nDouglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC.\n\u201cThe word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no\ndoubt it applies here.\u201d\nReuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to\nquestions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan\u2019s Ministry\nof Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on\ninvestigations.\nDuring the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific\nto uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This\nincluded interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement\nofficials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence\nreports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings\nand other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in\nMyanmar\u2019s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia\u2019s Golden\nTriangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing\ndrugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited\nthe Thai compound of one of the syndicate\u2019s alleged drug lords.\nWhat emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly\ntransnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the\nAFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often\nrefer to as \u201cT1\u201d - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong,\nMacau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.\nThe syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and\nsophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin\nAmerican cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies\na bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a\nmore diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels\ndo, including Japan\u2019s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic\nChinese gangs across Southeast Asia.\nThe crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled\noutbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police\nsay. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked\nrivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a\nunited pursuit of gargantuan profits.\n\u201cThe crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate\nwith seamless efficiency,\u201d says one veteran Western anti-drugs\nofficial. \u201cThey function like a global corporation.\u201d\nLike most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed,\nthe investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.\nIn addition to the contrasts between their drug operations,\nthere\u2019s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop\nand Joaquin \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed\nMexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine\ntrafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their\nextravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has\nbeen revealed about Tse\u2019s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug\nlords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.\n\nA TRIP, A TRAP\nTse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern\nChina, and grew up during China\u2019s Cultural Revolution. Amid the\nbloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group\nof imprisoned members of Mao\u2019s Red Guard in the southern city of\nGuangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big\nCircle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police,\nand like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong\nKong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their\ncriminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.\nIn the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong,\nMacau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based\nin Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling\nring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless\nopium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand,\nChina and Laos meet.\nIn 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on\ndrug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New\nYork. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into\nAmerica, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over\nhis head.\nThrough a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged\nfor leniency.\nHis ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His\n12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed.\nIf freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed\n\u201cgreat sorrow\u201d for his crime, court records show.\nThe entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to\nnine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional\ninstitution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.\nAfter he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to\nCanada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for\nthe next four years. It\u2019s unclear when Tse returned to his old\nhaunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife\nregistered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company\nLtd, in Hong Kong in 2011.\nPolice suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He\n\u201cpicked up where he left off,\u201d said the senior AFP investigator.\nTse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and\nthe Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved\nirresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his\ndrug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no\nextra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.\nHis policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for\nbusiness, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011,\nAFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and\nmeth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather\nthan arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under\nsurveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely\nfor more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug\ncell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They\nwanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.\nThe syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other\ndrug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and\nselling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the\nsyndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the\nMelbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police\nwatched the Australian meet two men.\nOne of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted\nhair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese\nfamily man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance\nshowed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal\nsecurity. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of\nThai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eight\nworked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as\npart of his security protocol.\nTse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts\nand five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in\nprivate jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand\nfor a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt,\naccording to a member of the task force investigating the\nsyndicate.\nTse was a frequent visitor to Asia\u2019s casinos and fond of\nbetting on horses, especially on English races. \u201cWe believe he\nlost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the\ntables in Macau,\u201d said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.\nAs the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected\nthat the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia\nwith meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA,\ncommonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the\nSam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say,\nwhen a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of\nwhite powder strapped to each of his thighs.\n\n\u2018ALADDIN\u2019S CAVE OF INTEL\u2019\nCai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the\nairport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It\nwas the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous,\npicking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said\na former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation.\n\u201cHis hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,\u201d the\ncommander told Reuters. \u201cMethamphetamine is very toxic.\u201d\nCai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs\nwas a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful\ntranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. \u201cWe were very\nfortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,\u201d the\ncommander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been\nmonitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police\nhad no idea who he was.\nCai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a\n\u201cpesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,\u201d according to\nMyanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A\nfriend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father.\nCai\u2019s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for\nketamine at the airport, the commander said.\nUnimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight.\nThe next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport.\nOne recognized him from surveillance work he\u2019d been conducting.\nStill, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they\nlater found on one of his phones might have explained his\nsilence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least\nthree assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch\nand electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said\none investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy\nsaying \u201cLoyalty to the Heavens.\u201d The banner was a \u201ctriad-related\nsign,\u201d he added.\nThe tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed\nthe video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat\nbecause he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a\nlaw enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of\nthe victim\u2019s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad\nmembers were sending a message about the price of disloyalty,\nthe officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.\nThe torture videos were just one of the items allegedly\nfound in Cai\u2019s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was\na diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate\u2019s activities, but\nsloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones,\npolice say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media\nconversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.\nThey were \u201can Aladdin\u2019s Cave of intel,\u201d said one AFP\ncommander based in North Asia.\nFor at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly\ntravelled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for\nthe syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the\nDrug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its\ninvestigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip\nfrom an international courier company recording the delivery of\ntwo consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf\nChinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea\npackets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had\nbeen cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.\nTwo days after Cai\u2019s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon\naddress, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That\nevening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon\njetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so,\nMyanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but\nother than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate,\nincluding couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.\nThen came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery\nof photos and videos on Cai\u2019s phones, an AFP investigator based\nin Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing\nhe had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier.\n\u201cThis one stuck out because it was Canadian,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI\nsaid: \u2018Fuck, I know who you are!'\u201d\nIt was Tse Chi Lop.\nThe Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of\nintelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work\non Cai\u2019s phones.\nAustralia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime\ngangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade,\nthe AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and\nsmall, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent\ndescribed the database, which includes a trove of names,\nchemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and\nsurveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence\non Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.\nThe AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai\u2019s\nphones with the database. They discovered photos related to\nthree big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in\nChina, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators\nand Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese\nanti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and\naddresses in Cai\u2019s phones to other meth busts in China.\nFor regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations\nupended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by\ndifferent crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the\nwork of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics\nagent said they believed Cai was \u201cone of the members of a\nmega-syndicate,\u201d which had been involved in multiple \u201cdrugs\ncases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.\u201d\nCai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still\nin jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking\ncharges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to\ncontact Cai\u2019s lawyer.\n\nMETH PARADISE\nDuring his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing\nthe country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and\nobtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a\nbigger vessel in international waters, according to police and\nthe Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures\nof the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where\nthe meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.\nThe police reconstruction of Cai\u2019s dealings in Myanmar led\nto another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production\nhad shifted from China\u2019s southern provinces to Shan State in\nMyanmar\u2019s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had\nprovided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor\ningredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were\nsmuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in\nthe Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the\nfreedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.\nArmed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan\nState have long controlled large tracts of territory and used\ndrug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the\nmilitary. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar\ngovernment with rebel groups over the years has brought relative\ncalm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to\nflourish.\n\u201cProduction facilities can be hidden from law enforcement\nand other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,\u201d\nanalyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the\nInternational Crisis Group. \u201cDrug production and profits are now\nso vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.\u201d\nThe Myanmar government and police did not respond to\nquestions from Reuters.\nAlong the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there\nis evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts\na deep ravine known as the \u201cValley of Death,\u201d where ethnic\nKachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for\ndecades with Myanmar\u2019s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past\ntrucks carrying building materials and workers.\nThe Kaung Kha militia\u2019s immaculate and expansive new\nheadquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green\nhills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers\naway, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved\nout of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned\nout vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba\ntablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine.\nWhen it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more\nthan 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg\nof caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances\nused in drug production.\nThe Loikan facility was \u201cvery likely\u201d to have been the\nsource of much of the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s meth, said the\nYangon-based AFP officer.\n\u201cSome militia were involved in the lab,\u201d said Oi Khun, a\ncommunications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia,\nin an interview. He paused, then added: \u201cBut not with the\nknowledge of senior members\u201d of the militia.\nOne person in Loikan described how workers from the lab\nwould come down from the hills. The men, like most of the\nvillagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the\nlocals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.\n\u201cI asked them once. \u2018Why don\u2019t you bathe?\u2019\u201d the person said.\n\u201cThey said they did, but there was nothing they could do about\nthe smell.\u201d\nThe rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the\nskin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature\nstench might reveal their illicit activities. \u201cWe all knew,\u201d the\nperson said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t talk about it. That just brings you\ndanger.\u201d\nMeth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals,\nsay Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network\u2019s\ncouriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the\nAsia-Pacific.\nShan\u2019s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the\nworld, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told\nReuters. \u201cThey can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the\nground and let it dry.\u201d\nThe UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth\nis worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business\nmodel for meth is \u201cvery different\u201d to heroin, said the UNODC\u2019s\nDouglas. \u201cInputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not\nneeded, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore\nfar, far higher.\u201d\nThe wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in\nnortheastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a\nUNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control\nCommission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to\nthe UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand,\n$298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the\nJapanese market, that\u2019s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.\nThe money the syndicate is making \u201cmeans that if they lose\nten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,\u201d\nsaid the Chinese counter-narcotics official. \u201cThey can afford\nfailure. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u2018MONEY, MONEY\u2019\nThe analysis of Cai\u2019s phones was continuing to provide\nleads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the\npick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with\nMyanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at\nsea for weeks.\nOne of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the\nShun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement\ndocument reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea\nwhen, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a\nmarine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and\npaid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV\nValkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s\nand hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea\nsickness tablets. According to local media, he didn\u2019t have a\nfishing license at the time.\nAfter buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on\na course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in\nthe Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the\nrendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western\nAustralian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was\nseen \u201cunloading a lot of packages\u201d into a van, the commander\nsaid.\n\u201cWe knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of\norganized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and\ncomes back with some gear on it, that it hasn\u2019t just dropped\nfrom the sky in the middle of the ocean.\u201d\nInvestigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car\nhire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug\ntraffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say,\nthat some of Smith\u2019s alleged co-conspirators were members of an\nethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and\nComanchero motorcycle gangs, known as \u201cbikies\u201d in Australia.\nAs they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of\ncrystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor\nsyndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy\nof an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians\nreconvened in Perth a month later.\nBikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and\na self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had\nrefined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star\nhotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police\ninvestigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants,\nsaid the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth.\nThe restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that\nincluded caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.\nOn November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again,\nthis time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the\nAndaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth\nfrom Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast\nof the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the\nIndian Ocean.\nThe Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.\nWhen the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in\ninternational waters off the West Australian coast on December\n19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting \u201cmoney, money,\u201d\naccording to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De\nMan\u2019s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith\nand his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved\ntheir identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by\nthe crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.\nThe Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of\nGeraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The\nmen unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of\nthe AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault\nweapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty\nto importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of\nhis alleged associates are still on trial.\nTaiwan\u2019s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it\nhad \u201cworked together with our counterparts on the investigation\u201d\nof the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the \u201csubstantial\nseizure of illicit narcotics\u201d by the Australian authorities in\nDecember 2017. The bureau said it was \u201caware that Taiwanese\nsyndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in\n(the) Asia-Pacific region,\u201d and was working \u201ccollaboratively and\nclosely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and\ncross-border drug trafficking.\u201d\n\nNIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED\nAs the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police\nconcluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone\na kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the\nthree biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the\n1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The\nother two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse\u2019s original triad, and the\nBamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator,\nthe syndicate\u2019s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that\nit \u201cmust rival Apple\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cThe syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market\nto tap,\u201d said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior\ncolonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade.\n\u201cThe power this network possesses is unimaginable.\u201d\nInvestigators have had wins. In February last year, police\nbusted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough\ntea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66\nwas intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than\none tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor\nlieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar.\nIn December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected\nsyndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.\nLocated near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed\ncompound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used\nto experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a\n100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to\nthe back of the property.\nSue wasn\u2019t there, but property and money from 38 bank\naccounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized\nduring the investigation. Sue is still at large.\nBut the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the\nwider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal\nmeth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and\nSoutheast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in\nmost countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising\nseizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019,\n\u201csuggested the supply of the drug had expanded.\u201d\nIn the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive\nadversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug\nmotherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product\nin shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth\ncoming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the\nsyndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This\nincluded deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each\ncontaining about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on\nnarrow jungle paths.\nOver the years, police have had little success in taking\ndown Asia\u2019s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders\nhave been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to\nthe AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics\nkingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than\na short period was in the mid-1970s. That\u2019s when Ng Sik-ho, a\nwily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced\nto 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium\nand morphine, according to court records.\nSo far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho\u2019s fate. He is being\ntracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say\ncounter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they\nbelieve he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.\n(Reporting by Tom Allard. Additional reporting by Reuters\nStaff. Editing by Peter Hirschberg.)",

        "text": "By Emma Batha\nLONDON, Oct 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When a\nchildren's hospital in Aleppo was decimated in 2016 after\nmultiple bombings, British-Syrian doctor Rola Hallam decided to\nturn her grief into action.\nWithin weeks the London consultant anaesthetist was on the\nway to the Syrian border with enough equipment to build the\nworld's first crowdfunded hospital.\n\"Thousands of people from around the world came together to\nraise the money we needed,\" said Hallam, who won the Women of\nthe Year lifetime achievement award in London on Monday.\n\"The Syrian doctors and nurses were blown away. For the\nfirst time they felt heard and seen by people around the world.\nIt gave them so much hope that they named it Hope Hospital.\"\nThe hospital, which has since treated 200,000 children, is\nsupported by CanDo, a social enterprise Hallam set up to help\nlocal humanitarians in warzones crowdfund lifesaving work that\nlarger aid organisations often cannot do.\n\"In Syria, I've really seen the absolute worst of humanity,\nbut I've also seen the very best,\" Hallam told the Thomson\nReuters Foundation at the award ceremony.\n\"The remarkable doctors and nurses that I've had the honour\nand privilege to work with inspire me and motivate me every\nsingle day.\"\nHallam, 40, who moved to Britain as a teenager after growing\nup in Damascus, said the idea for CanDo was born in 2013 when\nshe was working in a Syrian field hospital in rural Aleppo.\nShe was among medics who treated children for horrific burns\nafter a schoolyard was bombed.\nIt was a heartbreaking day made even worse because Hallam\ndid not have all the equipment, medicines and resources she\nneeded to help the children.\n\"I should have been able to give them sedation and pain\nkillers, put a breathing tube in ... Instead, I had to send them\nsuffocating and in pain to Turkey,\" she said.\n\n\"BEYOND BURNT-OUT\"\nAlthough Syrian non-governmental organisations carry out 75%\nof humanitarian work they receive less than 1% of aid funds for\nthe country, Hallam said, a pattern also seen in other warzones.\nAt the same time Hallam said there is growing public\ndisillusionment with some bigger charities, with many people\nwanting to know exactly how and where their donations go.\nNot only are local humanitarians first on the scene, but\nthey can reach communities cut off from other aid and remain\nafter other agencies have pulled out. They also share the same\nculture and language as the people they are helping.\nHallam said CanDo had raised 1.3 million pounds ($1.6\nmillion) since 2017 for projects that have helped 500,000\npeople. It wants to expand to Yemen, South Sudan and Myanmar.\nIn Syria, Hallam would like to see mental health support and\nrest breaks for the \"heroes\" on the frontline.\n\"International aid workers get rest and recuperation. Local\naid workers do not get any of that. They are beyond burnt-out.\nImagine, eight years of this hell,\" she said.\nHallam said attacks on Syria's health services were used as\na weapon of war and were \"crimes against humanity\".\nShe said there had been more than 500 attacks on hospitals,\n90% by Syrian forces and their allies, and more than 800 of her\ncolleagues had been killed, many under torture.\n\"This is premeditated destruction ... in order to terrorise\na civilian population into submission,\" she said.\nBut she warned that the destruction of Syria's health\ninfrastructure also had global repercussions - fuelling the\nrefugee crisis and raising the risks that Syria will be the\nsource of the next Ebola-scale health emergency.\n\"If we don't rebuild Syria's healthcare system we are going\nto be the next exporter of these global diseases,\" she said.\n(1 = 0.7960 pounds)\n(Reporting by Emma Batha @emmabatha; Editing by Belinda\nGoldsmith\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

        "text": "By Tom Allard\nBANGKOK (Reuters) - He is Asia\u2019s most-wanted man. He is protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private jet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night at a Macau casino.\nTse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected of leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate formed out of an alliance of five of Asia\u2019s triad groups, according to law enforcement officials. Its members call it simply \u201cThe Company.\u201d Police, in a nod to one of Tse\u2019s nicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for \u201cBrother Number Three.\u201d\nThe syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of methamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen countries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South Pacific. But meth \u2013 a highly addictive drug with devastating physical and mental effects on long-term users \u2013 is its main business, they say.\nIn what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s meth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be as high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the cartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a 40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has expanded at least fourfold in the past five years.\nThis unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an unprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the prime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously unreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the Australian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about 20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far the biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug trafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in the investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar, China, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan, while not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the investigation.\nA document containing AFP profiles of the operation\u2019s top 19 syndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the leader of the syndicate. According to the document, the organization has \u201cbeen connected with or directly involved in at least 13 cases\u201d of drug trafficking since January 2015. The document does not provide specific details of the cases.\nA Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the \u201cMultinational CEO\u201d of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional government agencies says Tse is \u201cbelieved to be\u201d the leader of the Sam Gor syndicate.\nPolice have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected boss of the trafficking group.\nSome investigators say that the scope of the syndicate\u2019s operation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin America\u2019s most legendary narco-traffickers. \u201cTse Chi Lop is in the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,\u201d said Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC. \u201cThe word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no doubt it applies here.\u201d\nReuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to questions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on investigations.\nDuring the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific to uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This included interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement officials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence reports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings and other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in Myanmar\u2019s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia\u2019s Golden Triangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing drugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited the Thai compound of one of the syndicate\u2019s alleged drug lords.\nWhat emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly transnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the AFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often refer to as \u201cT1\u201d - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.\nThe syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and sophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin American cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies a bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a more diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels do, including Japan\u2019s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic Chinese gangs across Southeast Asia.\nThe crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled outbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police say. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked rivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a united pursuit of gargantuan profits.\n\u201cThe crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate with seamless efficiency,\u201d says one veteran Western anti-drugs official. \u201cThey function like a global corporation.\u201d\nLike most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed, the investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.\nIn addition to the contrasts between their drug operations, there\u2019s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop and Joaquin \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed Mexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine trafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their extravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has been revealed about Tse\u2019s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug lords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.\n\nA TRIP, A TRAP\nTse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern China, and grew up during China\u2019s Cultural Revolution. Amid the bloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group of imprisoned members of Mao\u2019s Red Guard in the southern city of Guangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big Circle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police, and like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong Kong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their criminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.\nIn the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong, Macau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based in Asia. He rose to become a\u00a0mid-ranking member of a smuggling ring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless opium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand, China and Laos meet.\nIn 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on drug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New York. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into America, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over his head.\nThrough a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged for leniency.\nHis ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His 12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed. If freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed \u201cgreat sorrow\u201d for his crime, court records show.\nThe entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to nine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional institution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.\nAfter he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to Canada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for the next four years. It\u2019s unclear when Tse returned to his old haunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife registered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company Ltd, in Hong Kong in 2011.\nPolice suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He \u201cpicked up where he left off,\u201d said the senior AFP investigator. Tse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and the Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved irresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his drug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no extra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.\nHis policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for business, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011, AFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and meth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather than arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under surveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely for more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug cell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They wanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.\nThe syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other drug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and selling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the syndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the Melbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police watched the Australian meet two men.\nOne of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted hair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese family man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance showed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal security. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators.\u00a0Up to eight worked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as part of his security protocol.\nTse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts and five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in private jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand for a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt, according to a member of the task force investigating the syndicate.\nTse was a frequent visitor to Asia\u2019s casinos and fond of betting on horses, especially on English races. \u201cWe believe he lost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the tables in Macau,\u201d said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.\nAs the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected that the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia with meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the Sam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say, when a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of white powder strapped to each of his thighs.\n\n\u2018ALADDIN\u2019S CAVE OF INTEL\u2019\nCai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the airport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It was the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous, picking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said a former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation. \u201cHis hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,\u201d the commander told Reuters. \u201cMethamphetamine is very toxic.\u201d\nCai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs was a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful tranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. \u201cWe were very fortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,\u201d the commander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been monitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police had no idea who he was.\nCai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a \u201cpesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,\u201d according to Myanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A friend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father. Cai\u2019s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for ketamine at the airport, the commander said.\nUnimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight. The next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport. One recognized him from surveillance work he\u2019d been conducting.\nStill, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they later found on one of his phones might have explained his silence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least three assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch and electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said one investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy saying \u201cLoyalty to the Heavens.\u201d The banner was a \u201ctriad-related sign,\u201d he added.\nThe tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed the video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat because he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a law enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of the victim\u2019s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad members were sending a message about the price of disloyalty, the officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.\nThe torture videos were just one of the items allegedly found in Cai\u2019s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was a diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate\u2019s activities, but sloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones, police say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media conversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.\nThey were \u201can Aladdin\u2019s Cave of intel,\u201d said one AFP commander based in North Asia.\nFor at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly traveled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for the syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the Drug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its investigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip from an international courier company recording the delivery of two consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf Chinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea packets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had been cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.\nTwo days after Cai\u2019s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon address, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That evening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon jetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so, Myanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but other than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate, including couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.\nThen came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery of photos and videos on Cai\u2019s phones,\u00a0an AFP investigator based in Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing he had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier. \u201cThis one stuck out because it was Canadian,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI said: \u2018Fuck, I know who you are!'\u201d\nIt was Tse Chi Lop.\nThe Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of intelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work on Cai\u2019s phones.\nAustralia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime gangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade, the AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and small, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent described the database, which includes a trove of names, chemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and surveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence on Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.\nThe AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai\u2019s phones with the database. They discovered photos related to three big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in China, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators and Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese anti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and addresses in Cai\u2019s phones to other meth busts in China.\nFor regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations upended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by different crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the work of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics agent said they believed Cai was \u201cone of the members of a mega-syndicate,\u201d which had been involved in multiple \u201cdrugs cases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.\u201d\nCai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still in jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking charges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to contact Cai\u2019s lawyer.\n\nMETH PARADISE\nDuring his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing the country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and obtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a bigger vessel in international waters, according to police and the Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures of the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where the meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.\nThe police reconstruction of Cai\u2019s dealings in Myanmar led to another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production had shifted from China\u2019s southern provinces to Shan State in Myanmar\u2019s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had provided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor ingredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were smuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the freedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.\nArmed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan State have long controlled large tracts of territory and used drug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the military. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar government with rebel groups over the years has brought relative calm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to flourish.\n\u201cProduction facilities can be hidden from law enforcement and other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,\u201d analyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the International Crisis Group. \u201cDrug production and profits are now so vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.\u201d\nThe Myanmar government and police did not respond to questions from Reuters.\nAlong the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there is evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts a deep ravine known as the \u201cValley of Death,\u201d where ethnic Kachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for decades with Myanmar\u2019s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past trucks carrying building materials and workers.\nThe Kaung Kha militia\u2019s immaculate and expansive new headquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green hills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers away, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved out of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned out vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba tablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine. When it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more than 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg of caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances used in drug production.\nThe Loikan facility was \u201cvery likely\u201d to have been the source of much of the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s meth, said the Yangon-based AFP officer.\n\u201cSome militia were involved in the lab,\u201d said Oi Khun, a communications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia, in an interview. He paused, then added: \u201cBut not with the knowledge of senior members\u201d of the militia.\nOne person in Loikan described how workers from the lab would come down from the hills. The men, like most of the villagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the locals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.\n\u201cI asked them once. \u2018Why don\u2019t you bathe?\u2019\u201d the person said. \u201cThey said they did, but there was nothing they could do about the smell.\u201d\nThe rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the skin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature stench might reveal their illicit activities. \u201cWe all knew,\u201d the person said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t talk about it. That just brings you danger.\u201d\nMeth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals, say Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network\u2019s couriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the Asia-Pacific.\nShan\u2019s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the world, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told Reuters. \u201cThey can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the ground and let it dry.\u201d\nThe UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth is worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business model for meth is \u201cvery different\u201d to heroin, said the UNODC\u2019s Douglas. \u201cInputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not needed, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore far, far higher.\u201d\nThe wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in northeastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a UNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control Commission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to the UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand, $298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the Japanese market, that\u2019s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.\nThe money the syndicate is making \u201cmeans that if they lose ten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,\u201d said the Chinese counter-narcotics official. \u201cThey can afford failure. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u2018MONEY, MONEY\u2019\nThe analysis of Cai\u2019s phones was continuing to provide leads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the pick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with Myanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at sea for weeks.\nOne of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the Shun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement document reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea when, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a marine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and paid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV Valkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s and hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea sickness tablets. According to local media, he didn\u2019t have a fishing license at the time.\nAfter buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on a course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in the Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the rendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western Australian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was seen \u201cunloading a lot of packages\u201d into a van, the commander said.\n\u201cWe knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of organized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and comes back with some gear on it, that it hasn\u2019t just dropped from the sky in the middle of the ocean.\u201d\nInvestigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car hire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug traffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say, that some of Smith\u2019s alleged co-conspirators were members of an ethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and Comanchero motorcycle gangs, known as \u201cbikies\u201d in Australia.\nAs they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of crystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor syndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy of an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians reconvened in Perth a month later.\nBikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and a self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had refined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star hotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police investigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants, said the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth. The restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that included caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.\nOn November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again, this time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the Andaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth from Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the Indian Ocean.\nThe Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.\nWhen the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in international waters off the West Australian coast on December 19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting \u201cmoney, money,\u201d according to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De Man\u2019s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith and his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved their identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by the crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.\nThe Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of Geraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The men unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of the AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault weapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty to importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of his alleged associates are still on trial.\nTaiwan\u2019s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it had \u201cworked together with our counterparts on the investigation\u201d of the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the \u201csubstantial seizure of illicit narcotics\u201d by the Australian authorities in December 2017. The bureau said it was \u201caware that Taiwanese syndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in (the) Asia-Pacific region,\u201d and was working \u201ccollaboratively and closely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and cross-border drug trafficking.\u201d\n\nNIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED\nAs the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police concluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone a kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the three biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the 1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The other two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse\u2019s original triad, and the Bamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator, the syndicate\u2019s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that it \u201cmust rival Apple\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cThe syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market to tap,\u201d said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior colonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade. \u201cThe power this network possesses is unimaginable.\u201d\nInvestigators have had wins. In February last year, police busted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough tea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66 was intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than one tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor lieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar. In December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected syndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.\nLocated near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed compound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used to experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a 100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to the back of the property.\nSue wasn\u2019t there, but property and money from 38 bank accounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized during the investigation. Sue is still at large.\nBut the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the wider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal meth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and Southeast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in most countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising seizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019, \u201csuggested the supply of the drug had expanded.\u201d\nIn the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive adversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug motherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product in shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth coming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the syndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This included deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each containing about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on narrow jungle paths.\nOver the years, police have had little success in taking down Asia\u2019s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders have been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to the AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics kingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than a short period was in the mid-1970s. That\u2019s when Ng Sik-ho, a wily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium and morphine, according to court records.\nSo far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho\u2019s fate. He is being tracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say counter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they believe he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.\n\n\n\n (Reporting by Tom Allard. Additional reporting by Reuters Staff. Editing by Peter Hirschberg.)",

        "text": "(For more Reuters Special Reports, click on)\nBy Tom Allard\nBANGKOK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - He is Asia\u2019s most-wanted man. He\nis protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private\njet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night\nat a Macau casino.\nTse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected\nof leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate\nformed out of an alliance of five of Asia\u2019s triad groups,\naccording to law enforcement officials. Its members call it\nsimply \u201cThe Company.\u201d Police, in a nod to one of Tse\u2019s\nnicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for \u201cBrother Number\nThree.\u201d\nThe syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of\nmethamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen\ncountries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South\nPacific. But meth \u2013 a highly addictive drug with devastating\nphysical and mental effects on long-term users \u2013 is its main\nbusiness, they say.\nIn what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations\nOffice on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s\nmeth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be\nas high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the\ncartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a\n40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has\nexpanded at least fourfold in the past five years.\nThis unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an\nunprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the\nprime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously\nunreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the\nAustralian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about\n20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far\nthe biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug\ntrafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in\nthe investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar,\nChina, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan,\nwhile not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the\ninvestigation.\nA document containing AFP profiles of the operation\u2019s top 19\nsyndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the\nleader of the syndicate. According to the document, the\norganization has \u201cbeen connected with or directly involved in at\nleast 13 cases\u201d of drug trafficking since January 2015. The\ndocument does not provide specific details of the cases.\nA Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the\n\u201cMultinational CEO\u201d of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement\nAdministration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional\ngovernment agencies says Tse is \u201cbelieved to be\u201d the leader of\nthe Sam Gor syndicate.\nPolice have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected\nboss of the trafficking group.\nSome investigators say that the scope of the syndicate\u2019s\noperation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin\nAmerica\u2019s most legendary narco-traffickers. \u201cTse Chi Lop is in\nthe league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,\u201d said Jeremy\nDouglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC.\n\u201cThe word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no\ndoubt it applies here.\u201d\nReuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to\nquestions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan\u2019s Ministry\nof Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on\ninvestigations.\nDuring the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific\nto uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This\nincluded interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement\nofficials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence\nreports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings\nand other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in\nMyanmar\u2019s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia\u2019s Golden\nTriangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing\ndrugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited\nthe Thai compound of one of the syndicate\u2019s alleged drug lords.\nWhat emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly\ntransnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the\nAFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often\nrefer to as \u201cT1\u201d - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong,\nMacau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.\nThe syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and\nsophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin\nAmerican cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies\na bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a\nmore diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels\ndo, including Japan\u2019s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic\nChinese gangs across Southeast Asia.\nThe crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled\noutbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police\nsay. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked\nrivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a\nunited pursuit of gargantuan profits.\n\u201cThe crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate\nwith seamless efficiency,\u201d says one veteran Western anti-drugs\nofficial. \u201cThey function like a global corporation.\u201d\nLike most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed,\nthe investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.\nIn addition to the contrasts between their drug operations,\nthere\u2019s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop\nand Joaquin \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed\nMexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine\ntrafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their\nextravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has\nbeen revealed about Tse\u2019s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug\nlords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.\n\nA TRIP, A TRAP\nTse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern\nChina, and grew up during China\u2019s Cultural Revolution. Amid the\nbloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group\nof imprisoned members of Mao\u2019s Red Guard in the southern city of\nGuangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big\nCircle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police,\nand like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong\nKong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their\ncriminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.\nIn the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong,\nMacau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based\nin Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling\nring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless\nopium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand,\nChina and Laos meet.\nIn 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on\ndrug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New\nYork. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into\nAmerica, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over\nhis head.\nThrough a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged\nfor leniency.\nHis ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His\n12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed.\nIf freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed\n\u201cgreat sorrow\u201d for his crime, court records show.\nThe entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to\nnine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional\ninstitution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.\nAfter he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to\nCanada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for\nthe next four years. It\u2019s unclear when Tse returned to his old\nhaunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife\nregistered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company\nLtd, in Hong Kong in 2011.\nPolice suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He\n\u201cpicked up where he left off,\u201d said the senior AFP investigator.\nTse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and\nthe Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved\nirresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his\ndrug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no\nextra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.\nHis policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for\nbusiness, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011,\nAFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and\nmeth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather\nthan arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under\nsurveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely\nfor more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug\ncell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They\nwanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.\nThe syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other\ndrug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and\nselling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the\nsyndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the\nMelbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police\nwatched the Australian meet two men.\nOne of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted\nhair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese\nfamily man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance\nshowed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal\nsecurity. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of\nThai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eight\nworked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as\npart of his security protocol.\nTse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts\nand five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in\nprivate jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand\nfor a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt,\naccording to a member of the task force investigating the\nsyndicate.\nTse was a frequent visitor to Asia\u2019s casinos and fond of\nbetting on horses, especially on English races. \u201cWe believe he\nlost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the\ntables in Macau,\u201d said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.\nAs the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected\nthat the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia\nwith meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA,\ncommonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the\nSam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say,\nwhen a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of\nwhite powder strapped to each of his thighs.\n\n\u2018ALADDIN\u2019S CAVE OF INTEL\u2019\nCai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the\nairport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It\nwas the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous,\npicking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said\na former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation.\n\u201cHis hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,\u201d the\ncommander told Reuters. \u201cMethamphetamine is very toxic.\u201d\nCai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs\nwas a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful\ntranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. \u201cWe were very\nfortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,\u201d the\ncommander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been\nmonitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police\nhad no idea who he was.\nCai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a\n\u201cpesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,\u201d according to\nMyanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A\nfriend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father.\nCai\u2019s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for\nketamine at the airport, the commander said.\nUnimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight.\nThe next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport.\nOne recognized him from surveillance work he\u2019d been conducting.\nStill, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they\nlater found on one of his phones might have explained his\nsilence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least\nthree assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch\nand electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said\none investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy\nsaying \u201cLoyalty to the Heavens.\u201d The banner was a \u201ctriad-related\nsign,\u201d he added.\nThe tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed\nthe video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat\nbecause he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a\nlaw enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of\nthe victim\u2019s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad\nmembers were sending a message about the price of disloyalty,\nthe officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.\nThe torture videos were just one of the items allegedly\nfound in Cai\u2019s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was\na diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate\u2019s activities, but\nsloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones,\npolice say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media\nconversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.\nThey were \u201can Aladdin\u2019s Cave of intel,\u201d said one AFP\ncommander based in North Asia.\nFor at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly\ntravelled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for\nthe syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the\nDrug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its\ninvestigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip\nfrom an international courier company recording the delivery of\ntwo consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf\nChinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea\npackets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had\nbeen cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.\nTwo days after Cai\u2019s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon\naddress, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That\nevening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon\njetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so,\nMyanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but\nother than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate,\nincluding couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.\nThen came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery\nof photos and videos on Cai\u2019s phones, an AFP investigator based\nin Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing\nhe had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier.\n\u201cThis one stuck out because it was Canadian,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI\nsaid: \u2018Fuck, I know who you are!'\u201d\nIt was Tse Chi Lop.\nThe Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of\nintelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work\non Cai\u2019s phones.\nAustralia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime\ngangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade,\nthe AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and\nsmall, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent\ndescribed the database, which includes a trove of names,\nchemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and\nsurveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence\non Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.\nThe AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai\u2019s\nphones with the database. They discovered photos related to\nthree big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in\nChina, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators\nand Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese\nanti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and\naddresses in Cai\u2019s phones to other meth busts in China.\nFor regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations\nupended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by\ndifferent crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the\nwork of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics\nagent said they believed Cai was \u201cone of the members of a\nmega-syndicate,\u201d which had been involved in multiple \u201cdrugs\ncases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.\u201d\nCai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still\nin jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking\ncharges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to\ncontact Cai\u2019s lawyer.\n\nMETH PARADISE\nDuring his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing\nthe country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and\nobtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a\nbigger vessel in international waters, according to police and\nthe Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures\nof the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where\nthe meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.\nThe police reconstruction of Cai\u2019s dealings in Myanmar led\nto another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production\nhad shifted from China\u2019s southern provinces to Shan State in\nMyanmar\u2019s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had\nprovided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor\ningredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were\nsmuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in\nthe Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the\nfreedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.\nArmed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan\nState have long controlled large tracts of territory and used\ndrug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the\nmilitary. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar\ngovernment with rebel groups over the years has brought relative\ncalm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to\nflourish.\n\u201cProduction facilities can be hidden from law enforcement\nand other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,\u201d\nanalyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the\nInternational Crisis Group. \u201cDrug production and profits are now\nso vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.\u201d\nThe Myanmar government and police did not respond to\nquestions from Reuters.\nAlong the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there\nis evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts\na deep ravine known as the \u201cValley of Death,\u201d where ethnic\nKachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for\ndecades with Myanmar\u2019s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past\ntrucks carrying building materials and workers.\nThe Kaung Kha militia\u2019s immaculate and expansive new\nheadquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green\nhills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers\naway, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved\nout of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned\nout vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba\ntablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine.\nWhen it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more\nthan 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg\nof caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances\nused in drug production.\nThe Loikan facility was \u201cvery likely\u201d to have been the\nsource of much of the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s meth, said the\nYangon-based AFP officer.\n\u201cSome militia were involved in the lab,\u201d said Oi Khun, a\ncommunications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia,\nin an interview. He paused, then added: \u201cBut not with the\nknowledge of senior members\u201d of the militia.\nOne person in Loikan described how workers from the lab\nwould come down from the hills. The men, like most of the\nvillagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the\nlocals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.\n\u201cI asked them once. \u2018Why don\u2019t you bathe?\u2019\u201d the person said.\n\u201cThey said they did, but there was nothing they could do about\nthe smell.\u201d\nThe rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the\nskin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature\nstench might reveal their illicit activities. \u201cWe all knew,\u201d the\nperson said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t talk about it. That just brings you\ndanger.\u201d\nMeth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals,\nsay Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network\u2019s\ncouriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the\nAsia-Pacific.\nShan\u2019s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the\nworld, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told\nReuters. \u201cThey can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the\nground and let it dry.\u201d\nThe UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth\nis worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business\nmodel for meth is \u201cvery different\u201d to heroin, said the UNODC\u2019s\nDouglas. \u201cInputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not\nneeded, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore\nfar, far higher.\u201d\nThe wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in\nnortheastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a\nUNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control\nCommission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to\nthe UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand,\n$298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the\nJapanese market, that\u2019s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.\nThe money the syndicate is making \u201cmeans that if they lose\nten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,\u201d\nsaid the Chinese counter-narcotics official. \u201cThey can afford\nfailure. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u2018MONEY, MONEY\u2019\nThe analysis of Cai\u2019s phones was continuing to provide\nleads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the\npick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with\nMyanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at\nsea for weeks.\nOne of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the\nShun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement\ndocument reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea\nwhen, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a\nmarine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and\npaid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV\nValkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s\nand hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea\nsickness tablets. According to local media, he didn\u2019t have a\nfishing license at the time.\nAfter buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on\na course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in\nthe Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the\nrendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western\nAustralian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was\nseen \u201cunloading a lot of packages\u201d into a van, the commander\nsaid.\n\u201cWe knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of\norganized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and\ncomes back with some gear on it, that it hasn\u2019t just dropped\nfrom the sky in the middle of the ocean.\u201d\nInvestigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car\nhire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug\ntraffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say,\nthat some of Smith\u2019s alleged co-conspirators were members of an\nethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and\nComanchero motorcycle gangs, known as \u201cbikies\u201d in Australia.\nAs they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of\ncrystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor\nsyndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy\nof an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians\nreconvened in Perth a month later.\nBikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and\na self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had\nrefined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star\nhotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police\ninvestigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants,\nsaid the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth.\nThe restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that\nincluded caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.\nOn November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again,\nthis time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the\nAndaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth\nfrom Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast\nof the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the\nIndian Ocean.\nThe Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.\nWhen the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in\ninternational waters off the West Australian coast on December\n19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting \u201cmoney, money,\u201d\naccording to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De\nMan\u2019s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith\nand his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved\ntheir identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by\nthe crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.\nThe Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of\nGeraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The\nmen unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of\nthe AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault\nweapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty\nto importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of\nhis alleged associates are still on trial.\nTaiwan\u2019s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it\nhad \u201cworked together with our counterparts on the investigation\u201d\nof the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the \u201csubstantial\nseizure of illicit narcotics\u201d by the Australian authorities in\nDecember 2017. The bureau said it was \u201caware that Taiwanese\nsyndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in\n(the) Asia-Pacific region,\u201d and was working \u201ccollaboratively and\nclosely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and\ncross-border drug trafficking.\u201d\n\nNIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED\nAs the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police\nconcluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone\na kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the\nthree biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the\n1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The\nother two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse\u2019s original triad, and the\nBamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator,\nthe syndicate\u2019s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that\nit \u201cmust rival Apple\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cThe syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market\nto tap,\u201d said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior\ncolonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade.\n\u201cThe power this network possesses is unimaginable.\u201d\nInvestigators have had wins. In February last year, police\nbusted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough\ntea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66\nwas intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than\none tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor\nlieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar.\nIn December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected\nsyndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.\nLocated near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed\ncompound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used\nto experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a\n100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to\nthe back of the property.\nSue wasn\u2019t there, but property and money from 38 bank\naccounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized\nduring the investigation. Sue is still at large.\nBut the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the\nwider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal\nmeth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and\nSoutheast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in\nmost countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising\nseizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019,\n\u201csuggested the supply of the drug had expanded.\u201d\nIn the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive\nadversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug\nmotherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product\nin shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth\ncoming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the\nsyndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This\nincluded deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each\ncontaining about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on\nnarrow jungle paths.\nOver the years, police have had little success in taking\ndown Asia\u2019s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders\nhave been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to\nthe AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics\nkingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than\na short period was in the mid-1970s. That\u2019s when Ng Sik-ho, a\nwily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced\nto 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium\nand morphine, according to court records.\nSo far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho\u2019s fate. He is being\ntracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say\ncounter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they\nbelieve he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.\n(Reporting by Tom Allard. Additional reporting by Reuters\nStaff. Editing by Peter Hirschberg.)",

        "text": "By Nanchanok Wongsamuth\nSAMUT SAKHON, Thailand, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation)\n- Z in Mar was a housewife in the Burmese city of Bago when she\nsaw an advertisement for a job at Thai Union Group, a global\nseafood supplier and the world's biggest producer of tuna.\nThe 44-year-old paid a local recruitment agency about 4,300\nThai baht ($140) - less than half the sum that most migrants\nfrom Myanmar pay to win work in neighbouring Thailand.\nZin Mar is among the 23,000 Burmese workers Thai Union\nemployed under what the company calls its ethical migrant\nrecruitment policy.\nThree in four of its workers are migrants in a company that\noperates in 13 countries and is considered a leader in efforts\nto clean up an industry that was rife with worker abuse.\nFour years after the Thai seafood industry came under fire\nfor its work practices, the government and private sector have\nintroduced a raft of measures - from worker contracts to tighter\nlaws - to clean up the multi-billion dollar sector.\nThai Union was among the first to react, though campaigners\nsay smaller firms have copied its lead and the pace of reform\nmust continue if the industry is to ward off bad practice.\nThe industry was badly in need of a cleanup.\nIn 2014, it was accused of widespread slavery, trafficking\nand violence on fishing boats and in processing factories.\nLEADER OF THE PACK\nThai Union was among the first in an industry worth $6.6\nbillion to adopt an ethical recruitment policy in 2016, with\nhelp from the Migrant Worker Rights Network (MWRN), a local\nnon-profit assisting migrant workers, to reduce worker debt.\nDebt bondage is one of the world's most prevalent forms of\nmodern slavery, affecting 610,000 people in Thailand, shows the\nGlobal Slavery Index by rights group Walk Free Foundation.\nUnder debt bondage, workers are tricked into paying to get a\njob, then end up trapped in a never-ending cycle of repayments\nthat effectively means they work for free and are enslaved.\nUnder the more ethical Thai Union policy, it pays the\nrecruitment fees, while workers pay about 4,300 baht for\npermits, health checks, visas and other services.\nOne of the first collaborations between the private sector\nand civil society, it spawned a host of copies, such as the\nSeafood Task Force, a coalition of businesses and charities that\nregularly audits fishing vessels to prevent human rights abuses.\nCharoen Pokphand Foods, Thailand's largest agriculture\nconglomerate, has worked for two years with a campaign group\nthat helps migrant workers lodge complaints about their company.\nAnother firm, Seafresh Industry, has joined with the\nanti-trafficking Issara Institute to set up a migrant helpline.\n\"There's an increasing dialogue taking place between\nindustry and civil society,\" said Darian McBain, who joined Thai\nUnion in 2015 as global director of corporate affairs and\nsustainability.\n\nIOU\nThailand has 3 million migrant workers on its books; the\nUnited Nations estimates there are at least 2 million more\nworking illegally across the country.\nMany are mired in debt or were trafficked into Thailand\nagainst their will, worker rights activists say.\nAbout 55% of seafood processing workers paid a recruitment\nfee in Thailand averaging 11,000 baht ($360), according to a\n2018 report by the International Labour Organization.\n\"The first thing we did was give MWRN access to our facility\nso they could talk to workers,\" said McBain. \"And what they\nfound was that migrant workers were arriving from Myanmar in\nlarge debts that had built up as they journeyed to Thailand.\"\nThe company stopped employing migrants who had already got\nto Thailand and began recruiting directly from Myanmar through\nInternational Focus, an agent trained on the new policy.\nMWRN then ensures the recruits do not pay any extra fees.\n\"We have found cases of brokers charging workers up to\n500,000 kyat ($327) to find work with Thai Union, and when this\nhappens, we investigate what money they paid and who they paid\nit to and if necessary we'd pay it back,\" MWRN secretary general\nSein Htay told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nAbout 500,000 baht of fees have been returned to Thai Union\nworkers, he said.\nNow the challenge is to ensure workers pay no fees.\nJacques-chai Chomthongdi, a policy and campaign manager at\nBritish charity Oxfam, said workers could pay up to four times\nthe legal limit of 150,000 kyat at home to get work abroad.\n\"Workers still have to bear these costs, and those in debt\nare at risk of forced labour,\" Chomthongdi said.\nHe spoke on behalf of a coalition of civil society\norganisations that advise the Thai seafood industry.\nThai Union was a trailblazer in fighting modern slavery, he\nsaid, but smaller firms are now adopting similar policies in a\nbid to stamp out exploitation during the recruitment process.\n\"Other companies, some with a much smaller scale, are\nstarting to catch up,\" said Chomthongdi.\n\"This is a welcome development. However, if they (Thai\nUnion) don't adapt and ensure that the implementation of\nexisting good policies are maintained rigorously, they might\neventually become a follower.\"\n\n'BUSINESS AS USUAL'\nIn 2015, the European Union (EU) gave Thailand a \"yellow\ncard\" warning for failing to prevent illegal and unregulated\nfish from entering the supply chain and ending up in Europe. It\nrequired Thailand to clean up in six months or face a trade ban.\nThe EU removed the yellow card in January this year in light\nof efforts by Thailand to combat human trafficking and improve\nconditions for workers.\nBut fisheries associations - emboldened by a change in\ngovernment - are now pushing for a relaxation to the rules.\nAmong the demands: dropping age restrictions so 16-year-olds\ncan work on fishing boats, scrapping vessel inspections; letting\nvessels swap out crew and catch at sea, far from any oversight.\n\"One of the main challenges Thailand is facing at the moment\nis ensuring that the reforms that have been painstakingly\nintroduced over the past five years are not swiftly removed and\nreplaced with policies that would return the\nindustry to \u2018business as usual\u2019,\" said Steve Trent, executive\ndirector of Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF), an advocacy\ngroup that investigates environmental and human rights abuses.\nIndustry experts are also urging Thailand to grant migrant\nworkers the same rights in terms of freedom to organise and\ncollective bargaining as Thai workers.\nAt Thai Union, employees can email their concerns, post\nsuggestions to post boxes or call a third-party hotline.\n\"Collaboration and engagement is key to solving the world's\nbig challenges like ending modern slavery,\" McBain said.\n(Reporting by Nanchanok Wongsamuth @nanchanokw; Editing by\nLyndsay Griffiths.

        "text": "By Emma Batha\nLONDON, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - An estimated 10\nto 15 million people are not recognised as nationals by any\ncountry, often depriving them of basic rights most of the world\ntakes for granted such as education, healthcare, housing and\njobs.\nThe U.N. refugee agency is hosting a major intergovernmental\nmeeting in Geneva on Monday to assess progress at the midpoint\nof its #Ibelong campaign which aims to end statelessness by\n2024. Here are examples of stateless populations:\n\nMYANMAR/BANGLADESH: In 1982, Buddhist-majority Myanmar\npassed a citizenship law that effectively rendered stateless\nmost Rohingya, who are Muslim and of South Asian descent.\nEthnic violence has driven many to leave, but hundreds of\nthousands remain in Myanmar. There are about 900,000 Rohingya in\nneighbouring Bangladesh and smaller populations across Asia.\nSome are sold into slavery on fishing boats and plantations.\n\nIVORY COAST: Ivory Coast is home to 692,000 stateless\npeople. Many are descended from migrants from neighbouring\ncountries who were encouraged to work on Ivory Coast's coffee\nand cotton plantations in the 20th century.\nAt least a quarter of Ivory Coast's population is estimated\nto be of foreign descent, and the question of who is or is not\nIvorian helped fuel two civil wars in the West African country.\n\nTHAILAND: Nearly 479,000 people are stateless, including\nmembers of ethnic hill tribes such as the Yao, Hmong and Karen\nwho live in the mountainous border with Myanmar and Laos, and\nthe semi-nomadic \"Sea Gypsies\" along the Andaman coast.\n\nESTONIA/LATVIA: When the Soviet Union broke up, many ethnic\nRussians remained in the new Baltic states and were defined as\n\"non-citizens\".\nNearly 221,000 stateless people live in Latvia and 78,000 in\nEstonia, mainly ethnic Russians who have trouble obtaining\ncitizenship and at times face discrimination.\n\nSYRIA: In 1962, many Kurds in the northeast were stripped of\ncitizenship, a move Human Rights Watch described as part of a\nplan to \"Arabise\" the resource-rich region.\nBefore the civil war, there were an estimated 300,000\nstateless Kurds in Syria, many of whom were promised nationality\nby President Bashar al-Assad in reaction to the 2011 uprising.\nU.N. data suggests the number fell to 160,000, but this may\nbe partly because many fled the war.\nHuman rights experts have warned that babies born to Syrian\nrefugee women in Lebanon and Jordan could end up stateless.\n\nKUWAIT: Stateless people are known as Bidoon, which is short\nfor bidoon jinsiya meaning \"without nationality\" in Arabic. Some\ntrace their origins to nomadic tribes that once moved freely\naround the Gulf region.\nThere are about 92,000 Bidoon in Kuwait, according to U.N.\ndata, but some estimates are much higher. They are often barred\nfrom free education, healthcare and many jobs.\n\nNEPAL: Although Nepal says it does not have a stateless\npopulation, experts on statelessness believe many people,\npossibly hundreds of thousands, may be affected.\nPart of the problem derives from a law banning women married\nto foreigners from passing their nationality to their children.\nThere is also a stateless population of people who were expelled\nby Bhutan in the 1990s.\n\nDOMINICAN REPUBLIC: A 2013 court ruling, along with earlier\nchanges to nationality laws aimed at tackling illegal migration,\nhas left many stateless, mostly people of Haitian descent who\nwere born in Dominican Republic.\nIn 2015, there were about 134,000 stateless people,\naccording to U.N. data, but the figures are being updated.\n\nIRAQ: There are about 47,500 stateless people who include\nBidoon and Faili Kurds, an ethnic group that historically live\nboth sides of the Iraq-Iran border.\nMore than 100,000 Faili Kurds had their nationality revoked\nin 1980 under the Ba'ath regime. Although many have since had\ntheir nationality reinstated, others remain stateless.\n\nEUROPE: Tens of thousands of stateless Roma - an ethnic\ngroup with origins in India - are thought to live in central,\neastern and southern Europe. With the break-up of Czechoslovakia\nand Yugoslavia, successor states claimed they belonged\nelsewhere.\nOther Roma in Kosovo and Bosnia have become stateless due to\nwar-time displacement.\nRoma are often unable to register their children's births or\nhold official property titles. This can make it hard to prove\nwhere they are from.\n\nVENEZUELA: Some children born to Venezuelan parents who have\nfled to other countries amid a political and economic crisis at\nhome are at increased risk of statelessness.\n(Reporting by Emma Batha @emmabatha, Editing by Claire Cozens.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

        "text": "By Nellie Peyton\nNEW YORK, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda on\nThursday announced plans for a bill that would impose the death\npenalty on homosexuals, following plans announced by Brunei\nearlier this year to do the same.\nSame-sex relations are illegal in at least 68 countries\naround the world, according to the International Lesbian, Gay,\nBisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA).\nIn addition to Uganda and Brunei, here are eight countries\nthat have recently moved to roll back LGBT+ rights.\n\n1. United States\nThe United States began implementing a ban on transgender\npeople serving in the military this year, after President Donald\nTrump announced the change in 2017.\nTrump cited medical costs as one reason for rolling back a\n2016 policy of his predecessor Barack Obama, which had allowed\ntransgender people to serve openly for the first time and also\nreceive medical care to transition genders.\n\n2. Russia\nRussia fined its first minor last year under a so-called\n\"gay propaganda\" law that has been increasingly used to repress\nthe LGBT+ community.\nThe 2013 law makes illegal any event or act regarded by the\nauthorities as an attempt to promote homosexuality to minors. It\nhas been used to stop gay pride marches and detain gay rights\nactivists.\n\n3. Poland\nPoland's ruling party leader condemned gay pride marches\nthis year and said the rule of law should be used to regulate\nwhat he called a \"travelling theatre\".\nAhead of elections later this month, the conservative Law\nand Justice (PiS) party has used its anti-LGBT+ stance as a key\ncampaign issue, which critics say has fomented violence toward\nthe gay community.\n\n4. Indonesia\nIndonesia has drafted a law that would ban gay sex, which\nparliament delayed voting on last month amid protests.\nThe proposed revisions to the criminal code also include a\nban on sex outside of marriage, a four-year jail term for\nabortions in the absence of a medical emergency or rape and a\nprison term for black magic.\n\n5. Nigeria\nNigeria passed a bill in 2014 that criminalized same-sex\nrelationships with penalties of up to 14 years in prison.\nAuthorities charged 43 people with homosexual acts in one\ncase in 2017, ordering most to undergo monitoring and \"sexual\nrehabilitation.\"\n\n6. Malaysia\nMalaysia's LGBT+ community has faced growing persecution,\nwith two women caned in public for \"attempting lesbian sex\" in\nthe state of Terengganu last year.\nPrime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the leader of a new\ngovernment elected last year, has said the country cannot accept\nsame-sex marriage or LGBT+ rights.\n\n7. Chad\nChad introduced a new penal code in 2017 with light prison\nsentences and fines for same-sex relations which had not been\nexplicitly criminalized before, although there was a law\ncondemning \"acts against nature\", according to the ILGA.\nAn earlier draft of the legislation from 2014 would have\ncriminalized gay sex with up to 20 years in prison.\n\n8. Slovakia\nSlovakia inserted a definition of traditional marriage in\nits constitution in 2014.\nIn 2015 the country held a referendum which would have\nstrengthened its ban on marriage and child adoption by same-sex\ncouples, but it failed to pass on low voter turnout.\n(Writing by Nellie Peyton; Editing by Chris Michaud.

        "text": "By Umberto Bacchi\nTBILISI, Oct 31 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A critical\nshortage of affordable housing in cities across the world has\nforced many people to tap such unexpected resources as shipping\ncontainers and concrete pipes just to put a roof over their\nhead.\nAt least 150 million people, about 2% of the global\npopulation, are homeless according to United Nations data while\nmore than 20% of the population lack adequate housing. Many live\nin cities.\nAs the U.N. marks World Cities Day on Thursday, here are\neight dwelling types which highlight how cities are coping with\nhousing crises:\n\nCAGE HOMES\nHong Kong's property prices have rocketed over 200% in the\npast decade driven by limited housing supply and large capital\nflows from mainland Chinese buyers, forcing some of the city's\npoorest to live in often squalid conditions.\nTens of thousands are crammed into rooftop shanties,\nso-called cage homes with plywood bunk beds, or into tiny\npartitioned flats averaging just 62 sq ft (6 sq m).\n\nSLEEPING PODS\nAs rising prices push city workers to live further from the\ncentre and endure long commutes, sleep pods which allow for a\npower nap near the office have popped up from Madrid and London\nto New York.\nIn the British capital, start-up Pop & Rest offers busy\ntravellers, flagging party-goers and restless new parents a bed\nin a tiny dark room scented with lavender and outfitted with ear\nplugs and eye masks for less than 20 pounds ($26) an hour.\n\nGARDEN HOMES\nAs part of a project to help refugees find homes in France,\nlocal non-profit Quatorze has installed tiny wooden houses\ninsulated with cardboard in some Paris backyards.\nThe first was set up in a family's garden in the eastern\nsuburb of Montreuil in 2017, with an Afghan refugee as its\ntenant. A second was installed at the back of an art gallery in\nthe same district earlier this year.\n\nGRANNY FLATS\nA growing number of homeowners in the U.S. capital of\nWashington - among the country's most expensive cities - have\nturned townhouse basements or garages into small living units\nto rent out, often to help cover mortgage costs.\nKnown as granny flats, mother-in-law suites or English\nbasements, these conversions are gaining in popularity across\nthe U.S. as a way to boost affordable housing, according to\nproperty experts.\n\nLIVE-IN GUARDIANS\nUp to 7,000 people are serving as guardians in empty\nproperties across Britain, mainly in London, according to a 2018\nreport by the London Assembly, an elected body that scrutinizes\nthe activities of the mayor.\nGuardians pay low rents in exchange for securing buildings\nfrom squatters and vandals, but sometimes live in poorly\nmaintained mouldy homes with few legal protections, the report\nsaid.\n\nSHIPPING CONTAINERS\nThousands of homeless children in Britain are being forced\nto sleep in often overcrowded converted shipping containers that\nare \"blisteringly hot\" in summer and \"freezing\" in winter, a\nreport by Children's Commissioner for England said in August.\n\nEGG HOUSE\nA Chinese man named Dai Haifei made international headlines\nin 2010 when, unable to afford Beijing's high rental prices, he\nlived for a few months in an homemade egg-shaped mobile house\nnear his office in the city.\nThe house was made of bamboo strips, steel bars, heat\nprevention and waterproof materials, sacks filled with fermented\nwood chips and grass seeds, as well as one solar panel, local\nmedia reported.\n\nWATER PIPES\nTo ease Hong Kong's housing crisis, a local architectural\nfirm created micro homes in concrete water pipes that can be\nstacked under elevated roadways or between highrises.\nMeasuring 2.5 metres (8 feet) in diameter, the pipes have\nbeen remade into 100 sq ft (9 sq m) apartments for two, with a\nliving and kitchen space, a shower and a toilet.\n\n(Sources: Reuters, Thomson Reuters Foundation, Quatorze, London\nAssembly, Children's Commissioner for England)\n($1 = 0.7797 pounds)\n\n(Reporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Chris\nMichaud.

        "text": "YEN THANH, Vietnam (Reuters) - Several townships in rural Vietnam sank into mourning on Saturday, with communities believing that many of the 39 people found dead in the back of a truck near London this week came from poor, rice-growing areas of the country.\nThe bodies were discovered on Wednesday after emergency services were alerted to people in a truck container on an industrial site in Grays, about 32 km (20 miles) east of central London.\nBritish police said on Saturday that they had charged one man, 25-year-old Maurice Robinson of Craigavon in Northern Ireland, with 39 counts of manslaughter and other offences including conspiracy to traffic people.\nPolice initially believed the dead were Chinese, but Beijing said the nationalities had not been confirmed and on Saturday a senior British police officer in charge of identification asked for help from Britain's Vietnamese community.\nChinese and Vietnamese officials are now both working closely with British police, the two countries' embassies have said. Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc ordered government officials to help establish the identities of the victims and look into cases of Vietnamese citizens sent abroad illegally.\nFather Anthony Dang Huu Nam, a Catholic priest in the remote town of Yen Thanh in northern-central Vietnam's Nghe An province, 300 km (180 miles) south of Hanoi, said he believed most of the dead were likely from Vietnam. He told Reuters he was liaising with family members.\n\"The whole district is covered in sorrow,\" Nam said, as prayers for the dead rang out over loudspeakers throughout the misty, rain-soaked town on Saturday. \"This is a catastrophe for our community.\"\nOn Saturday evening, Nam led around 500 worshippers in prayers for the dead as they held lit candles in the modest, white-walled church in Yen Thanh.\n\"We are here to pray for justice and peace, and for the victims of society. We pray for the 39 people who lost their lives on the way to the UK. They are people coming from central Vietnam, our land,\" Nam said.\nNam said families had told him they knew relatives were traveling to Britain at the time the container truck was traveling, and had been unable to contact their loved ones.\nThe British police officer in charge of identifying the victims, Detective Chief Inspector Martin Pasmore, said very few were carrying official identification and that he hoped to identify the dead through fingerprints, dental records and DNA, as well as photos from friends and relatives.\nPolice have found more than 500 items within the truck including bags, clothing and mobile phones that need to be assessed. Once a preliminary identification has been made, liaison officers will be deployed to support families.\nApart from the man charged, who will appear in court on Monday for an initial hearing, three other people are under arrest in Britain on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking. A fourth person is under arrest in Dublin.\n\n'BEAUTIFUL DAY'\nIn Yen Thanh, Nghe An province, dozens of worried relatives of 19-year-old Bui Thi Nhung gathered in the family's small courtyard home where her distraught mother has been unable to rise from her bed.\n\"She said she was in France and on the way to the UK, where she has friends and relatives,\" said Nhung's cousin, Hoang Thi Linh.\n\"We are waiting and hoping it's not her among the victims, but it's very likely. We pray for her every day. There were two people from my village traveling in that group\".\nIn comments under a photo uploaded to Nhung's Facebook account on Monday, two days before the doomed truck was discovered, one friend asked how her journey was going.\n\"Not good,\" Nhung replied. \"Almost spring,\" she said, using a term in Vietnamese meaning she had almost reached her destination.\nOther photos on her account show her sightseeing in Brussels on Oct. 18.\n\"Such a beautiful day,\" Nhung posted.\nAnother person who may have died is Nguyen Dinh Tu, who had been working illegally in Romania, and Germany, where he lost his job. \nA few months ago, he asked his wife Hoang Thi Thuong to help him raise 11,000 pounds ($14,000) to cover the cost of an illicit trip from Germany to the United Kingdom.\n\"I lost contact with him on October 21,\" Thuong told Reuters. \"I have a big debt to pay, no hope, and no energy to do anything\".\nTu's father said relatives in the United Kingdom had told him that Tu was inside the truck, and had been planning to pick him up.\n\"They were supposed to pick him up at the drop-off point but  they called and said Tu was in that truck,\" Tu's father, Nguyen Dinh Sat, told Reuters.\n\"I haven't heard anything from my son\".\n\nPARENTS 'CAN'T BREATHE'\nHow the victims came to be in the truck is not yet known.\nSome 70% of Vietnamese trafficking cases in the United Kingdom between 2009-2016 were for labor exploitation, including cannabis production and work in nail bars, according to a British government report last year.\n\"Women and girls from rural areas are also considered more susceptible to trafficking,\" the report said.\nBritish police sought to reassure anyone living in Britain illegally that they would not be investigated if they came forward to help with the identification. \n\"If you come to us, we will do all we can to put our arm around you and take you through this process, and establish as quickly as possible whether or not we have your loved involved in this tragic incident, and try and reunite you,\" Pasmore said. \nNghe An is one of Vietnam's poorest provinces, and home to many victims of human trafficking who end up in Europe, according to a March report by the Pacific Links Foundation, a U.S.-based anti-trafficking organization. \nOther victims are believed to come from the neighboring province of Ha Tinh, Father Nam said. In the first eight months of this year, 41,790 people left Ha Tinh looking for work elsewhere, including overseas, according to state media.\nThe province was ravaged by one of Vietnam's worst environmental disasters in 2016 when a steel mill owned by Taiwan's Formosa Plastics contaminated coastal waters, devastating local fishing and tourism industries.\nAnother suspected victim from Ha Tinh, 26-year-old Pham Thi Tra My, had sent a text message to her mother saying she could not breathe at about the time the truck container was en route from Belgium to Britain.\n\"That girl who said in her message that she couldn't breathe in the truck? Her parents can't breathe here at home,\" Nam said.   \n\n (Additional reporting by David Milliken and Kate Holton in London; Writing by James Pearson; Editing by Lincoln Feast, Stephen Coates, Frances Kerry and Alex Richardson)",

There were growing concerns at least 10 of the\nvictims could have been from Vietnam.\nHoa Nghiem from Human Rights Space, a civic network based in\nVietnam, said that Pham Thi Tra My, 26, had sent a text message\nto her mother saying she could not breathe at about the time the\ntruck container was en route from Belgium to Britain.\n\"I\u2019m sorry, mum and dad. My path abroad was not a success. I\nlove you both so much. I can\u2019t breathe. I'm from Nghen Town, Can\nLoc District, Ha Tinh, Vietnam ... I am sorry, Mom,\" the message\nsaid, according to Hoa who told Reuters it had come from Tra\nMy's family.\nShe said Tra My had gone to China and was planning to reach\nEngland via France and that the organisation was getting more\nalerts about possible Vietnamese victims in the refrigerated\ntrunk, which was found in the early hours of Wednesday.\nPolice have said they believe the dead were Chinese but\nBeijing said the nationalities had not yet been confirmed.\nChinese and Vietnamese officials are now both working closely\nwith British police, their respective embassies said.\n\"We owe it to those who have died to get this investigation\nright and speculation is not helpful,\" Essex Police's Deputy\nChief Constable Pippa Mills told reporters. \"It may in fact\nhinder our investigation and its progress.\"\nShe said they would not give any more details about the\nidentities or nationalities of the victims until the formal\nidentification process was complete.\nHer officers were still questioning the 25-year-old truck\ndriver on suspicion of murder following the discovery of the\nbodies in the back of his truck.\nHe has not been formally identified but a source familiar\nwith the investigation named him as Mo Robinson from the\nPortadown area of Northern Ireland.\nOn Friday, police also arrested a man and woman, both aged\n38, in Warrington, northwest England, and a 48-year-old man from\nNorthern Ireland at London's Stansted Airport. They are\nsuspected of conspiracy to traffic people and manslaughter.\nThe victims - 31 men and eight women - are being moved to a\nhospital mortuary from a secure location at docks near the\nindustrial estate in Grays about 20 miles (30 km) east of London\nwhere the bodies were found.\nPost-mortem examinations were beginning to determine how\nexactly they died while the lengthy process of identifying the\ndeceased was underway.\nVietHome, an organisation for the Vietnamese community in\nBritain, said it had received news from 10 families that their\nrelatives were missing.\nFor years, illegal immigrants have attempted to reach\nBritain stowed away in trucks, often from the European mainland.\nIn 2000, 58 Chinese were found dead in a tomato truck at the\nport of Dover.\n\nBRITAIN 'HAS NOT FULFILLED RESPONSIBILITY'\n\"We hope that the British side can as soon as possible\nconfirm and verify the identities of the victims, ascertain what\nhappened and severely punish criminals involved in the case,\"\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily\nnews briefing.\nChina's Global Times, which is published by the ruling\nCommunist Party's official People's Daily, said in a Friday\neditorial that Britain should bear some responsibility for the\ndeaths.\n\"It is clear that Britain and relevant European countries\nhave not fulfilled their responsibility to protect these people\nfrom such a death,\" the widely read tabloid said.\nIt added that Britain appeared not to have learned its\nlesson from the Dover incident two decades ago.\nThe police investigation is focused on the movement of the\ntrailer prior to its arrival at Purfleet docks near Grays little\nmore than an hour before the bodies were found, and on who was\nbehind the suspected human trafficking.\nIrish company Global Trailer Rentals said it owned the\ntrailer and had rented it out on Oct. 15.

MAYA BAY, THAILAND: The island cove was made famous by\nthe 2000 film \"The Beach\" starring Leonardo DiCaprio. It was\nclosed to tourists last year until 2021 in a bid to salvage the\narea's coral reefs, which have been damaged by warmer\ntemperatures and a flood of tourists.\n\n2. BORACAY ISLAND, THE PHILIPPINES: The resort was closed\nfor a six-month cleanup from April to October 2018 after being\ndescribed as a \"cesspool\" by President Rodrigo Duterte. The\nisland attracted 2 million visitors the previous year but has\nnow limited numbers to 19,000 per day and banned beach parties,\nsmoking and drinking.\n\n3. MOUNT EVEREST BASE CAMP, CHINA: The Chinese government\nclosed its side of the Everest base camp this year to anyone\nwithout a climbing permit due to the huge amounts of rubbish\npiling up at the site, according to the Lonely Planet travel\nwebsite. The Chinese base camp, located in Tibet, was accessible\nby car.\n\n4. FJADRARGLJUFUR CANYON, ICELAND: The popular site, which\nfeatured in one of Justin Bieber's music videos, was closed to\ntourists for about three months this year due to damage from wet\nweather and foot traffic. The number of visitors had nearly\ndoubled after being featured in the pop singer's \"I'll Show You\"\nvideo.\n\n5. THE FAROE ISLANDS, DENAMRK: Ten popular tourists sites\nwere closed temporarily this year for maintenance by an\ninternational team of volunteers after a 10% growth in visitor\nnumbers in recent years.\n\n6. SIPADAN ISLAND, MALAYSIA: One of the world's most\nrenowned scuba diving spots on Malaysia's part of Borneo island\nwill be shut for a month every December from 2020 to allow the\ncoral and marine ecosystem to recuperate.\n\n7. KOMODO ISLAND, INDONESIA: Authorities are due to limit\nvisitor numbers and raise entry prices to the island in order to\nconserve the population of the Komodo dragons, the world's\nlargest living species of lizard. Officials initially planned to\nclose the island for one year from 2020 but later scrapped the\nidea.\n\n8. SPANISH STEPS, ITALY: Rome banned tourists from sitting\non the famous monument in August, in a crackdown on overcrowding\nby tourists. Visitors can still walk up and down, but offenders\nof the sitting ban can be fined up to 400 euros ($444).\nThe site was largely shut between October 2015 and September\n2016 for a private restoration after the 135 steps had become\nloose, stained and cracked under the strain of daily use by both\nresidents and visitors.\n\nSource: Thomson Reuters Foundation, Reuters, New Straits\nTimes, Lonely Planet\n($1 = 0.9001 euros)\n(Writing by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi; Editing by Michael Taylor.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

Initial findings showed the truck passed through the Belgian cargo port of Zeebrugge, from where it crossed by ferry to Britain.\nThe victims - 31 men and eight women, all believed to be Chinese nationals - were found in a refrigerated truck on an industrial estate 20 miles (32 km) east of London. The driver was detained on suspicion of murder.\nBelgian prosecutors said they were looking into when and where the victims were loaded into the container. Regional British police said a case of human trafficking was suspected.\nThis was not the first fatal migrant transport routed through Zeebrugge - a container with the bodies of 58 Chinese inside found in the English port of Dover in 2000 had also come from the Belgian port.\nHowever, in recent years the focus of migrant efforts to reach Britain was the French port of Calais - across the Channel from Dover - offering more than hourly ferry services and an undersea tunnel on the shortest crossing to the United Kingdom.\nThe migrant community in Calais grew to some 6,000 people, most of them in a shanty town dubbed the Jungle, outside Calais until French authorities emptied it in October 2016, saying it was a security and health hazard.\nCast adrift and driven away from Calais by the Jungle's closure, many migrants looking for the next closest passage points made their way north to neighboring Belgium, said Stef Janssens at that country's federal center of migration.\n\nMIGRANT ROUTE SHIFTS\n\"There was a shift of the route to Britain from Calais to Belgium's E40 highway,\" he said, with people trafficking gangs taking control of parking spots where migrants congregate along the motorway leading from Brussels to the North Sea coast.\nIn contrast with Calais, Zeebrugge largely handles cargo with far fewer leisure travelers. \nDogs and heat scanners are used to detect stowaways though they might not be spotted in sealed, refrigerated containers like the one in which the 39 bodies were discovered this week.\nIn 2014, an Afghan migrant was found dead in a container that had arrived in the British port of Tilbury, along with 34 who had survived. This also had gone through Zeebrugge, but at a time when the scanner was not working. \n\"If they had to open up every container or every truck... there would be trucks (queued up) from here to Brussels. Every day there are 4,000 trucks coming to this port,\" Dirk de Fauw, mayor of the city of Bruges and chairman of adjacent Zeebrugge, told Reuters television.\nSmugglers remain on the E40 motorway, Janssens said, but in their hunt for spots with weaker port controls and security, they had headed even further north in the past two years.\n\"This has also shifted to Antwerp and ports such as Hook of Holland in the Netherlands because these ports are used less and subject to lesser controls,\" Janssens said.\nSmuggling migrants is lucrative, he said, with migrants charged up to 6,000 euros ($6,690) for \"guaranteed\" passage to Britain.\nThe Geneva-based International Organization for Migration (IOM) says it has noted a trend in the past year of increasing numbers of migrants also trying to cross to Britain in small boats. There were five drownings in the Channel this year.\nThe 39 deaths this week brought the total number of fatalities among migrants crossing the European continent to 97, compared with 92 at the same juncture in 2018. \n\n(The story is refiled with amended headline.)    \n\n (Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop and Marine Strauss; Editing by Mark Heinrich)",

        "text": "(Refiles with amended headline)\n* France's 2016 shutdown of Calais camp push migrants north\n* Forced to try less safe crossings from Belgian, Dutch\nports\n* People smugglers operate along highway from Brussels to\ncoast\n*\nBy Marine  Strauss and Philip Blenkinsop\nBRUSSELS, Oct 24 (Reuters) - When France shut the Calais\nshanty town known as the Jungle in 2016, migrants seeking entry\nto Britain were forced to look for less safe passage up the\ncoast in Belgium - the route taken by a truck in which 39 bodies\nwere found this week.\nBelgium's federal prosecutors, who handle cases of terrorism\nand organised crime, said on Thursday they had opened an\ninvestigation into the deadly transport. Initial findings showed\nthe truck passed through the Belgian cargo port of Zeebrugge,\nfrom where it crossed by ferry to Britain.\nThe victims - 31 men and eight women, all believed to be\nChinese nationals - were found in a refrigerated truck on an\nindustrial estate 20 miles (32 km) east of London. The driver\nwas detained on suspicion of murder.\nBelgian prosecutors said they were looking into when and\nwhere the victims were loaded into the container. Regional\nBritish police said a case of human trafficking was suspected.\nThis was not the first fatal migrant transport routed\nthrough Zeebrugge - a container with the bodies of 58 Chinese\ninside found in the English port of Dover in 2000 had also come\nfrom the Belgian port.\nHowever, in recent years the focus of migrant efforts to\nreach Britain was the French port of Calais - across the Channel\nfrom Dover - offering more than hourly ferry services and an\nundersea tunnel on the shortest crossing to the United Kingdom.\nThe migrant community in Calais grew to some 6,000 people,\nmost of them in a shanty town dubbed the Jungle, outside Calais\nuntil French authorities emptied it in October 2016, saying it\nwas a security and health hazard.\nCast adrift and driven away from Calais by the Jungle's\nclosure, many migrants looking for the next closest passage\npoints made their way north to neighbouring Belgium, said Stef\nJanssens at that country's federal centre of migration.\n\nMIGRANT ROUTE SHIFTS\n\"There was a shift of the route to Britain from Calais to\nBelgium's E40 highway,\" he said, with people trafficking gangs\ntaking control of parking spots where migrants congregate along\nthe motorway leading from Brussels to the North Sea coast.\nIn contrast with Calais, Zeebrugge largely handles cargo\nwith far fewer leisure travellers.\nDogs and heat scanners are used to detect stowaways though\nthey might not be spotted in sealed, refrigerated containers\nlike the one in which the 39 bodies were discovered this week.\nIn 2014, an Afghan migrant was found dead in a container\nthat had arrived in the British port of Tilbury, along with 34\nwho had survived. This also had gone through Zeebrugge, but at a\ntime when the scanner was not working.\n\"If they had to open up every container or every truck...\nthere would be trucks (queued up) from here to Brussels. Every\nday there are 4,000 trucks coming to this port,\" Dirk de Fauw,\nmayor of the city of Bruges and chairman of adjacent Zeebrugge,\ntold Reuters television.\nSmugglers remain on the E40 motorway, Janssens said, but in\ntheir hunt for spots with weaker port controls and security,\nthey had headed even further north in the past two years.\n\"This has also shifted to Antwerp and ports such as Hook of\nHolland in the Netherlands because these ports are used less and\nsubject to lesser controls,\" Janssens said.\nSmuggling migrants is lucrative, he said, with migrants\ncharged up to 6,000 euros ($6,690) for \"guaranteed\" passage to\nBritain.\nThe Geneva-based International Organization for Migration\n(IOM) says it has noted a trend in the past year of increasing\nnumbers of migrants also trying to cross to Britain in small\nboats. There were five drownings in the Channel this year.\nThe 39 deaths this week brought the total number of\nfatalities among migrants crossing the European continent to 97,\ncompared with 92 at the same juncture in 2018.\n($1 = 0.8969 euros)\n(Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop and Marine Strauss\nEditing by Mark Heinrich)",

        "text": "By Anastasia Moloney\nMEDELLIN, Colombia, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -\nG rowing up in a gang-ridden hillside slum in Colombia's second\ncity of Medellin, Bryan Estiven Carmona knew becoming a street\ndrug dealer was far more likely than getting a decent job.\n\"The idea of earning a quick, easy buck by working for the\ngangs is a common problem where I live. The temptation is always\nthere,\" said 21-year-old Carmona.\nYet against the odds, Carmona landed a job last year as a\nsoftware tester with the Medellin office of Arbusta, an\nArgentine tech company that does social good.\nHe is one of about 30 young men and women hired by Arbusta,\nwhich aims to give jobs to unemployed people from poor\nbackgrounds, with no work experience or university education.\nArbusta and 80 other companies, including local and foreign\nsocial enterprises, have set up shop at Ruta N, a\ngovernment-funded innovation center in the city of 2.5 million\npeople once known as the world's murder capital.\nSince then Ruta N has emerged as a leading hub for social\nentrepreneurship in Latin America, making the city one of\nworld's hot spots for social entrepreneurs according to a\nThomson Reuters Foundation poll on Tuesday.\n\"Here there's significant political will to drive social\ninnovation and entrepreneurship,\" said Maria Ines Londono,\nArbusta country manager. \"Ruta N is an oasis in the midst of\ndifficult neighborhoods.\"\nThe Thomson Reuters Foundation's second global poll of\nexperts on the best countries for social entrepreneurs,\nsupported by Deutsche Bank, found Medellin among the top four\ncity hot spots for business leaders seeking to do good.\nThe three others were Berlin, London, and Santiago.\nIn the inaugural poll in 2016, experts named Berlin, London,\nHong Kong, and Santiago as the global city hot spots.\n\nVIOLENT HISTORY\nIt is a big turnaround for Medellin, the epicenter of\nColombia's drug wars of the 1980s.\n\"We've had to become resilient and work together to move the\ncity forward, which creates a conducive environment for\nentrepreneurship,\" said Alejandro Franco, head of Ruta N,\nsitting in a co-working place in the building.\nScattered across a warren of slum areas are numerous\nexamples of Medellin's social innovation, driven by consecutive\nmayors over the past two decades and funded by city hall.\nNew schools, public libraries, open-air gyms and landscaped\nparks have been built in once once-neglected, no-go slum areas.\nMedellin's much copied cable car transport system ferries\nresidents up and down hillsides, connecting slum dwellers with\nthe rest of the city in a quick and affordable way.\nSocial entrepreneur Matt Alexander said Medellin's tradition\nof innovation and entrepreneurship were key reasons for locating\nhis U.S. company's international headquarters there.\n\"We wanted to be in an environment where public officials\nand others were accustomed to pushing the envelope in terms of\nthinking of new solutions for old problems,\" said the co-founder\nof Suyo, which uses technology to help poor families formalize\ntheir land and property titles.\nRuta N has supported dozens of social and tech businesses\nover the past decade by offering free mentoring opportunities\nand workshops on finance and technology, and help with access to\nfunding and low-interest loans.\n\"Ruta N is a hub that allows you to connect. It helps being\nunder one roof,\" said Andres Castellon, finance director at\nlikeU, a Colombian outsourcing and call center business that\nemploys women and single mothers from poor neighborhoods.\nWhile Medellin fared well in the poll as a hot spot,\nColombia's overall ranking in the list of best countries for\nsocial entrepreneurs dropped 25 places from three years ago to\n39 out of 43 countries.\nIn Colombia, social enterprise is a relatively new concept,\nemerging about five years ago. Experts said many businesses had\nset up in an informal way without government support.\nColombia does not define social enterprises by law as\nbusinesses with specific legal and tax treatment.\nPaula Zapata, who heads the Medellin mayor's office for\neconomic development, said the city's violent past had led to a\ntradition of the public sector, mayor, business leaders and\nuniversities coming together to solve social problems.\nThis has forged an environment where social entrepreneurs\ncan build partnerships with local government and academia.\n\"In the midst of adversity is when creativity emerges, it is\nwhen social innovation is born,\" Zapata said.\n(Reporting by Anastasia Moloney @anastasiabogota, Editing by\nBelinda Goldsmith\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

        "text": "By Rina Chandran\nHONG KONG, Oct 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When\nauthorities drew up a plan to make Hong Kong a hub for Asia's\nwine trade, they faced a big challenge: where to store the\nbottles in a city that was fast running out of space. So they\nwent underground.\nOfficials presented World War Two-era bunkers as potential\nsites, and former diplomat Gregory De'eb and businessman Jim\nThompson signed a lease on them, setting up Hong Kong's first\ncommercial wine cellar 20 metres (66 ft) below ground in 2003.\nCrown Wine Cellars can store more than 100,000 bottles, and\nalso has a subterranean clubhouse.\n\"It is the underground aspect of the club that is its most\nattractive and popular feature,\" said De'eb. \"Members even view\nthe lack of mobile phone reception as overwhelmingly positive.\"\nHong Kong plans to move more facilities beneath the Earth's\nsurface to free up space above, in one of the world's priciest\nreal-estate markets.\nWith almost 70% of the global population expected to be\nliving in urban areas by 2050, according to the United Nations,\ncities are coming under the spotlight as never before.\nFrom Singapore to sub-Saharan Africa, they are fast running\nout of space to house their swelling populations.\nCities have long put metro rail networks, as well as\nutilities like sewage and water pipes underground, with several\nalso moving commercial, retail and storage facilities down below\nto free up space or better handle extreme temperatures.\nIn Hong Kong, known for its towering skyscrapers and wooded\nhills, sky-high home prices have boosted the urgency of\nmaximising use of underground space.\nThe government has vowed to create more land for housing,\nincluding by building artificial islands.\nIt is also looking to use underground space for waste\ntreatment, data centres, water reservoirs, power stations,\ncrematoriums and sports facilities.\nThe city's rocky terrain lends itself to cavern development\nas a \"cost-effective alternative\" for long-term land supply that\noffers safety, environmental and security benefits, said Edward\nLo, Hong Kong's chief town planner.\n\"Given the lack of land resources in Hong Kong, it has all\nalong been our policy objective to develop underground space,\"\nhe added.\n\n'BAD' NEIGHBOURS\nFrom the catacombs of ancient Rome to step wells in medieval\nIndia and army bunkers, underground spaces have been used for a\nvariety of reasons down the ages.\nHelsinki and Montreal, which are blanketed in snow for\nseveral months of the year, are considered leaders in\n\"underground urbanism\", a movement focused on innovative ways to\nuse underground space.\nBesides mass transit, growing concerns around the\nenvironmental and health impacts of \"bad neighbour\" facilities\nsuch as refuse transfer and waste treatment plants have pushed\ncities to consider moving those below ground as well.\nUnderground space is ideal for a densely populated city like\nHong Kong, which has more than 7 million people crammed into an\narea of about 1,100 square kilometres (425 square miles), with\nless than a quarter of that land available for development.\nAbout a decade ago, authorities unveiled a policy aimed at\nstudying the opportunities in underground space.\nIn a government-commissioned study, consultancy Arup\nidentified 48 potential underground and hillside sites for new\ncaverns, and some 400 state facilities that could be moved\nunderground.\n\"The idea was to better integrate facilities, so people can\neasily move between them, and avoid the conflicts of traffic and\nweather disruptions above ground,\" said Mark Wallace, director\nof infrastructure at consultancy Arup.\n\"For the city, it results in more efficient use of space,\nreduces the impacts of urban sprawl, and helps preserve the\nnatural environment,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nWhile excavation and building underground are more\nexpensive, there are savings on maintenance and land costs, he\nadded.\nAnd less energy is needed because of more stable\ntemperatures underground, an important factor for cities looking\nto curb their carbon emissions.\nUnderground structures also perform better in earthquakes\nand need fewer repairs, while offering better protection from\ntyphoons and thunderstorms, which are forecast to become more\nsevere as global temperatures rise.\nCheaper, fast-digging technologies such as those used by\nbillionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk to build a high-speed\ntransport tunnel in Los Angeles, meanwhile, can cut construction\ntime and minimise disruption above ground.\n\"As older urban areas in Hong Kong deteriorate and new\ninfrastructure or redevelopment is needed, underground\ndevelopment is a way to build new facilities with minimum\ndisruption to the surface and public,\" Wallace said.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL RISKS\nElsewhere in Asia, space constraints and security concerns\nprompted the development of underground space decades ago in\nJapan and South Korea.\nMore than 20 Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai and\nShenzhen are now making plans for urban underground space, while\nSingapore unveiled an underground master-plan this year.\nHong Kong, like Singapore, has traditionally relied on\nreclaimed land, but that is seen as increasingly unsustainable\nbecause it fuels environmentally harmful processes like sand\nmining, said Mee Kam Ng, director of the urban studies programme\nat The Chinese University of Hong Kong.\nDigging out space underground can also have effects on\ngroundwater and surface ecology, she said.\nInstead, Hong Kong could free up nearly 4,000 hectares\nthrough better planning for its existing land resources such as\nthe largely rural New Territories in the north, she said, citing\nresearch by the Citizens Task Force, a non-profit network.\nSome residents are resistant to the idea of tearing up parks\nto create shopping malls underground.\nAn ongoing study of potential underground development in\nTsim Sha Tsui has drawn criticism from planners and locals, who\nsay any benefits will be outweighed by the damage to Kowloon\nPark, a green oasis in the congested city.\nThe plan proposes that underground spaces be built beneath\nabout a quarter of the 13-hectare park for retail and community\nfacilities, parking and pedestrian passages.\nAreas of the park could be affected for up to seven years\nduring construction, while parts of it will be surrendered for\naccess points, opponents say.\nAuthorities say the development will improve pedestrian\nmovement and reduce congestion, and that \"old and valuable\ntrees\" will be preserved.\nBut Paul Zimmerman, chief executive of Designing Hong Kong,\nan urban think-tank, said the project would wreck the park,\nwhile failing to ease traffic significantly.\n\"Good use of underground space is definitely needed in Hong\nKong, and it makes sense in some cases - like roads and sewage\ntreatment, and wine cellars,\" he said.\n\"But it does not make sense in others, like building a\nmulti-storey complex under a park that will destroy the park's\ncharacter and only creates more shops and parking.\"\n(Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran;

        "text": "By Thin Lei Win\nROME, Oct 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Keeping girls in\nschools in Africa is key to lowering the fast-growing\ncontinent's high fertility rates and ultimately ending hunger\nand poverty, U.S. economist Jeffrey Sachs said Wednesday.\nFailure to do would bring more misery and suffering to the\nregion, he warned, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa where nearly\none in four people already go hungry.\nAfrica currently has the world's highest rates of fertility,\nwith 4.6 births per woman compared to the global average of 2.9,\naccording to a United Nations report released in June.\nGirls leaving school early and entering motherhood is the\n\"overwhelming reason\" for this, Sachs told representatives of\nworld leaders in a World Food Day lecture at the U.N. Food and\nAgriculture Organization (FAO).\n\"Educate girls, fertility rates come down, women enter the\nlabour force. That's true across every country, every religion,\"\nsaid Sachs, who advised governments and the United Nations on\nthe latest global goals agreed in 2015 to tackle these issues.\nU.N. figures show that 130 million girls of school age\nglobally are not in school, and the world's highest rate of\nteenage pregnancy \u2014 143 per 1,000 girls aged 15\u201319 years \u2014 is in\nsub-Saharan Africa.\nCurrent projections show the population of Africa could more\nthan triple to 4.3 billion by 2100 from about 1.3 billion today.\n\"If Africa stays on this demographic trajectory, it's\nimpossible to end hunger and it is impossible to end poverty,\"\nsaid Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development\nat Columbia University in New York.\n\"Not only will those numbers run far ahead of any\ninfrastructure imaginable and any public services imaginable,\nbut the pressures on the physical land would be impossible,\nespecially in an era of climate change.\"\nHe urged developed nations and donors to ensure all children\nacross the globe completed secondary school.\nSachs said climate change and conflicts - which experts say\nare the main drivers of global hunger which has been rising for\nthree years in a row - are \"utterly within our control\".\n\"We need to end the use of coal, oil and gas and move to\nwind, hydrogen, solar, geothermal and other zero-carbon energy\nsources and to complete that transformation by mid-century,\" he\nsaid.\nIn Africa, for example, replacing wood stoves with\nrenewables could be done within 10 years, he said.\n\"It's a matter of placing the solar panels. And Africa is\nblessed with wonderful solar energy. It could power the whole\ncontinent,\" said Sachs.\n\"There is no problem that we face for which solutions have\nnot been identified ... but we have been under-investing in\nthese solutions.\"\n(Reporting By Thin Lei Win @thinink, Editing by Belinda\nGoldsmith\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, climate\nchange, women's and LGBT+ rights, human trafficking, and\nproperty rights.

        "text": "By Zoe Tabary\nLONDON, Oct 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Driverless\ntransport, underground shops, heated bike paths, armed street\npatrols \u2013 this is not the setting for a dystopian novel but it\ncould soon be the city where you live.\nAs the world sees the biggest wave of urban growth in\nhistory \u2013 with almost 70% of its population expected to be\nliving in urban areas by 2050, up from 56% today \u2013 the task of\nmaking cities greener and safer is becoming more urgent.\nThat cities are attracting more people is nothing new, noted\nurban specialist Philipp Rode, who runs London-based research\ncentre LSE Cities.\n\"People move to cities to live and work because they're a\nsolution: they significantly reduce the amount of movement and\nspace required to do anything,\" he told the Thomson Reuters\nFoundation.\n\"But the absolute increase in population, the millions\ncoming into cities - that's unprecedented.\"\nThe shift is creating significant challenges for many cities\nalready at risk from worsening climate change and rising\ninequality, with the race on to house swelling populations and\ntackle homelessness.\nTo cope with these modern-day pressures, cities around the\nworld are trying to become \"smarter\" - from moving storage and\nretail facilities underground, to using data and technology to\nimprove security, healthcare and mobility.\nMany cities, particularly in poorer nations, are also facing\nlarge and expanding slum populations which lack basic services,\nfueling inequality, and, in some cases, violence.\nMandy Pienaar, a 43-year-old media executive from\nJohannesburg, knows this only too well.\nOne winter evening, as she and her boyfriend drove home from\nthe movies in the South African city, two armed assailants\nhijacked their car, stripped them of their clothing and stole\ntheir bank cards before the couple managed to escape.\n\"It was quite shocking because there were a lot of people\nwalking past who kind of looked at me as if this was an everyday\noccurrence, to see a stripped woman sitting in a slum area in\nthe cold,\" Pienaar recalled.\nTheir ordeal illustrates the \"false sense of security\" that\ncomes with living as they do in a gated community, she said.\n\"We have bars on every window, huge dogs, electric fencing\n... to us that's normal. We've become desensitised.\"\nCommunity-led projects like \"vuvuzela patrols\" aim to tackle\nsuch violence, with groups of men armed with plastic trumpets\nescorting women on their daily commutes in Johannesburg.\nBut security is not the only worry on urban planners' minds.\nFrom the small U.S. city of Duluth to the metropolis of Hong\nKong, cities are thrashing out ways to reinvent themselves and\nrevamp how their residents live, move and consume.\n\"Mobility, water, waste: the world's greatest challenges are\nsolved in cities,\" said Tiina Kaho, head of the Helsinki\nMetropolitan Smart & Clean Foundation, a coalition of\nbusinesses, researchers and state officials.\nYet as the world transforms rapidly, \"cities will have to\ninnovate like never before\", she said.\n\nGOING UNDERGROUND\nFrom Singapore to sub-Saharan Africa, cities are running out\nof space to house swelling populations.\n\"It's a scarce resource,\" said Rode. \"Using that space in\nthe most efficient way possible is crucial.\"\nHistorically cities have tended to grow outwards rather than\nupwards, according to a report published by the World Resources\nInstitute and Yale University in January.\nBut, if uncontrolled, such expansion can make it challenging\nto deliver basic services, with trips to school or the doctor\nbecoming longer, for example. At the same time, it eats into\nfarmland and can threaten green areas and biodiversity.\nTo be sustainable, cities will need to temper their sprawl\nwith efforts to increase density, researchers said.\nIn Britain, for example, the government announced plans to\nbuild hundreds of thousands of new rural homes along its 'Green\nBelt' - protected areas in the English countryside.\nFor other cities, increasing density will mean putting more\nfacilities below ground - not just subway networks and utilities\nbut commercial, retail and storage facilities too.\nIn Hong Kong, known for its towering skyscrapers and wooded\nhills, there is a particular urgency to maximise use of\nunderground space, with home and land prices among the world's\nhighest.\nThe government has vowed to free more space for housing\nthrough measures like building artificial islands.\nIt is also looking to use underground spaces for waste\ntreatment, data centres, water reservoirs, power stations,\ncrematoriums and sports facilities.\n\"For the city, it results in more efficient use of space ...\nand avoids the conflicts of traffic and weather disruptions\nabove ground,\" said Mark Wallace, director of infrastructure at\nArup, a consultancy that studied underground space in Hong Kong.\nOther cities have also gone underground, with Finland's\ncapital Helsinki moving sports facilities and emergency shelters\nbelow the surface. Canada's Montreal, meanwhile, has a wide\npedestrian network of shops and hotels beneath its streets.\nIn December billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk unveiled a\n1.14-mile (1.8 km) tunnel in the Los Angeles area that was dug\nwith new fast, low-cost technology, as a first step to\ndeveloping a high-speed subterranean network for vehicles.\nWhile excavating and building underground is more expensive,\nthere are savings in maintenance and land costs, Wallace said.\nBut underground living is no replacement for better land-use\nplanning, researchers warned, while residents worry construction\nand access to buried facilities will eat into green space above.\nEuan Mills, urban design and planning lead at Future Cities\nCatapult, a UK-funded innovation centre, said cities should\n\"accommodate nature, but not at the expense of density\".\nFor him, the answer lies in building skywards.\n\"Human bodies need daylight, so going underground won't\nwork,\" he said.\n\nSAFE CITIES\nAs cities seek space to grow, they must also consider how\ntheir development affects social equality, said Rode of LSE\nCities.\n\"In fast-expanding cities the differences between rich and\npoor increase,\" he said.\nNeighbourhoods tend to display income disparities, leaving\nsome with better access to services, and leading to what Rode\ncalled \"anti-urban gestures\" such as gated communities.\nIn South Africa, the legacy of apartheid-era city planning\nand rapid urban population growth have contributed to making it\nthe most unequal country by income, according to the World Bank.\nSouth Africa's cities remain for the most part racially\ndivided more than 20 years after the end of apartheid, under\nwhich millions of black people were forcibly removed from\nwhite-only urban areas to live in crowded townships and\nhomelands, with buffer zones separating the races.\nThose patterns of inequality can stoke grievances, according\nto urban analysts, with South Africa \u2013 which has one of the\nworld's highest murder rates \u2013 in July deploying the army to\nquell a surge in violence in gang-infested parts of Cape Town.\nThat has led to a proliferation of private security firms,\nsuch as safety start-up Aura, which created a mobile platform\nallowing customers to access a network of armed emergency\nservices.\n\"The police are stretched thin,\" said Warren Myers, founder\nof Aura, which has received about 25 panic alerts a day from its\n70,000 users since its launch in 2017.\n\"We need to marry as many different technologies as possible\n- CCTV, facial recognition, data collection, WhatsApp groups -\nto better protect South Africans,\" he added.\nBut private security is hardly sufficient to tackle crime,\nanalysts warned, as realised by cities in Latin America where\ndrug-fuelled murder rates are among the world's highest.\nAfter decades of heavy-handed police tactics in cities in\nBrazil, Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela and parts of Central\nAmerica, new methods of tackling crime are gaining currency,\nwith a stronger focus on social development projects.\nIn Colombia's second city of Medellin, this approach has\nfocused on urban renewal in slums: once-neglected shanty\ndistricts now boast landscaped parks, open-air gyms, schools,\nplaygrounds and community halls where youth orchestras play.\n\"Sustained investment in deprived areas ... combined with\nincreased community policing and recreational alternatives, like\nafter-school programmes, have seemed to turn the dial in\nreducing homicide rates,\" said Robert Muggah, co-founder of the\nIgarape Institute, a Brazil-based think-tank.\nAfter the death of cocaine drug-lord Pablo Escobar in 1993,\nMedellin's murder rate plunged more than 90% from 266 per\n100,000 people in 1991 to 19 per 100,000 in 2018.\nMedellin resident Johan Rodriguez, 25, decided to retire\nfrom gang life after taking part in a six-month programme to\nkeep vulnerable people away from crime.\nThe \"Parceros\" (\"Mates\") project, launched last year by city\nhall, helps teenagers go back to school, get job interviews and\nset up small businesses, from textiles to DJing.\n\"While the violence is always there, the project showed me\nthere's something else around the corner, another way,\" said\nRodriguez, who now works in a motorbike factory after social\nworkers sent out his CV to employers across the city.\n\nCLIMATE HAVENS\nYet as record numbers of people move into cities, some urban\nareas are facing uncertainty over the future as climate change\nbrings worsening threats, from extreme heat to flooding.\nOne fifth of the world's major cities will experience\nunprecedented climate conditions by 2050, such as more intense\ndry and monsoon seasons, according to the Crowther Lab, a\nSwiss-based research group.\nResearchers predict that as wild weather becomes more\nfrequent, it could force millions of people to move out of\nharm's way, with some unable to return.\nFrom Indonesia's sinking capital of Jakarta to the Middle\nEast's sweltering cities, that poses a new kind of challenge for\nurban planners, Rode said.\n\"Cities have faced numerous events like wars or earthquakes\nwhen populations had to be evacuated, but the idea had always\nbeen to return and rebuild,\" he said.\nIn response to the threats, some U.S. cities - such as\nMinnesota's Duluth - are studying efforts to become top\ndestinations for Americans abandoning parts of the country that\nmay one day be made inhospitable by climate change.\nAngel Dobrow, 59, who works for a small firm that supports\nfarmers, and her husband have already made the move to lakefront\nDuluth, leaving their longtime home in another part of Minnesota\nin 2017.\n\"As a person concerned with climate change, being near\nfreshwater and having a little bit of land to grow food and grow\nherbs was critical for me,\" said Dobrow, sitting in her lush\ngarden in the northern city.\nDuluth, located by the world's largest freshwater lake, may\nnot seem the most obvious choice as a haven for climate\nmigrants.\nWith its frigid winters, the metropolis is often ranked as\none of the coldest cities in the United States.\nBut Sandy Hoff, the president and owner of local real estate\ndevelopment firm F.I. Salter, said a changing climate could spur\na property boom that would \"no doubt\" propel his company in ways\nunseen since his grandfather acquired it 90 years ago.\nDobrow said when summer heat and humidity burden other areas\nof Minnesota, Duluth's lakefront breezes \"feel like air\nconditioning\".\nBut some fear an influx of new residents could exacerbate a\nhousing crisis in a city where few new homes have been built.\nJoel Kilgour, who chairs Duluth's Affordable Housing\nCoalition and volunteers at housing non-profit Loaves and\nFishes, said the city's homeless are forced to seek rooms at the\ncharity as they cannot afford rising rents.\n\"If we as a community can't solve that, there's no way that\nwe're going to be able to handle an influx of climate refugees\nin an equitable manner,\" Kilgour said.\nPotential climate refuge cities may also struggle to build\ncostly infrastructure, such as water treatment plants and energy\nutilities, without a sufficient tax base ahead of time to pay\nfor them, researchers warned.\n\nSMART CITIES?\nTo try to thrive amid rapid urbanisation and worsening\nclimate change threats, many cities around the world are trying\nto become \"smarter\".\nFrom heated bike paths to melt snow in Toronto to high-tech\nsensors that detect when Barcelona's bins need emptying,\ngovernments are pooling resources from citizens and businesses\nto make cities more efficient, sustainable and livable.\nMany of those efforts focus on improving mobility in cities,\nwith urban planners looking at innovative ways to cut both\ntraffic and climate-warming emissions.\nDubai - which, according to the Roads and Transport\nAuthority (RTA), has more than one vehicle for every two people\n- is experimenting with driverless mobility pods that aim to\ncombine the comfort of ride-hailing services like Uber with the\nefficiency and capacity of buses.\nThe cube-shaped vehicles, built by U.S.-based NEXT Future\nTransportation Inc., can carry up to 10 people each and dock\ntogether when in motion, allowing passengers to move from one\nunit to the other using the front and rear doors.\nThe vehicles \u2013 which should enter mass production at the end\nof 2020 \u2013 are designed to pick up single users at home, then\npool people going in the same direction inside one module, as\nother pods are released to collect more passengers.\n\"It's like a relay race,\" said founder Tommaso Gecchelin.\nRode of LSE Cities said it was important one inefficient car\nsystem should not be replaced with another, adding autonomous\nvehicles should carry as many passengers as possible.\nAllowing private self-driving cars could result in empty\nvehicles \"just driving around waiting for their owners\", taking\nup public space needlessly, he warned.\nOther major smart city initiatives have run into delays or\nunexpected problems, sparking criticism.\nKenya's planned Konza Technopolis \u2013 a new $14.5 billion city\nto be built about 60 km (37 miles) southeast of crowded Nairobi\n\u2013 has fallen behind schedule on its goal of accommodating 20,000\npeople by 2020, according to Nairobi-based entrepreneurs and\nanalysts.\nDubbed the Silicon Savannah, Konza aims to become a modern\ntech hub but the first building has yet to be completed due to\nred tape and a lack of funding, critics noted.\nLavasa - the first city in India's $7.5 billion plan to turn\n100 urban centres into Smart Cities by 2020 - has suffered from\ndesign issues, and ignored the needs of poor and marginalised\ngroups, planners and rights groups have said.\n\"Urban planners, not cities, are the ones who need to get\nsmarter,\" said Mills of Future Cities Catapult, calling for more\ninvestment in data collection and training of city planners.\n\"Google knows more about our cities than planning\ndepartments do.\"\n\nSLOWER CITIES?\nEven as some cities become smarter and more efficient, calls\nalso are mounting to slow the frantic pace of urban life.\nEfforts range from the literal \u2013 with many cities pushing\nfor lower speed limits on their roads \u2014 to the imaginative,\nincluding art installations to promote mindfulness.\nOn a recent \"sound walk\" in the English town of Reading, a\ndozen residents, including a retired historian and teenage\nstudents, strolled silently through parks, graveyards and\nbookstores.\nLed by sound artist Richard Bentley, the group uploaded\nphotos and audio recordings from their phones to Hush City, an\napp that maps quiet areas in cities.\nWith noise pollution the most common cause of environmental\ncomplaints in Europe, according to the European Commission, and\nmore people crowding into urban areas, Bentley expects peace and\nquiet could become a \"commodified luxury\".\nHistorically, poorer groups lower down the social ladder\nhave had to live in noisy parts of cities while those with more\nmeans could move away, he said.\n\"It's incredibly important to keep these quiet spaces and to\nbe aware of their possible disappearance,\" he added.\nSome places are jumping on the livability bandwagon through\nCittaslow, which means \"slow city\" in Italian.\nThe global network of more than 260 cities grades its\nmembers according to factors such as sustainable infrastructure,\npromotion of local economies, fairness and \"good living\".\nSouth Korean member Jeonju, a city of about 650,000 people,\nhas planted millions of trees and runs monthly car-free zones\nsince joining in 2016, Mayor Seung-Su Kim said by email.\nPier Giorgio Oliveti, the network's secretary general, said\nthe approach could be a \"vaccine\" for the ills of modernity.\nBut Mills of Future Cities Catapult argued that \"one of the\nmost exciting things about cities is how alive they are\".\n\"I don't think we should be slowing them down,\" he added.\nNow, more than ever, urban planners and government should\n\"reflect on what cities are for\", advised LSE Cities' Rode.\n\"Why are cities such attractive places for living and\nworking? Because they bring people together to enjoy public\nlife,\" he said.\n\"That real, physical experience needs to be preserved.\"\n(Reporting by Zoe Tabary, Adela Suliman and Amber Milne in\nLondon, Umberto Bacchi in Dubai, Carey L.

        "text": "(Repeats for clients in Asia.)\nBy Tom Allard\nBANGKOK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - He is Asia\u2019s most-wanted man. He\nis protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private\njet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night\nat a Macau casino.\nTse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected\nof leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate\nformed out of an alliance of five of Asia\u2019s triad groups,\naccording to law enforcement officials. Its members call it\nsimply \u201cThe Company.\u201d Police, in a nod to one of Tse\u2019s\nnicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for \u201cBrother Number\nThree.\u201d\nThe syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of\nmethamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen\ncountries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South\nPacific. But meth \u2013 a highly addictive drug with devastating\nphysical and mental effects on long-term users \u2013 is its main\nbusiness, they say.\nIn what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations\nOffice on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s\nmeth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be\nas high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the\ncartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a\n40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has\nexpanded at least fourfold in the past five years.\nThis unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an\nunprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the\nprime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously\nunreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the\nAustralian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about\n20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far\nthe biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug\ntrafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in\nthe investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar,\nChina, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan,\nwhile not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the\ninvestigation.\nA document containing AFP profiles of the operation\u2019s top 19\nsyndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the\nleader of the syndicate. According to the document, the\norganization has \u201cbeen connected with or directly involved in at\nleast 13 cases\u201d of drug trafficking since January 2015. The\ndocument does not provide specific details of the cases.\nA Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the\n\u201cMultinational CEO\u201d of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement\nAdministration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional\ngovernment agencies says Tse is \u201cbelieved to be\u201d the leader of\nthe Sam Gor syndicate.\nPolice have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected\nboss of the trafficking group.\nSome investigators say that the scope of the syndicate\u2019s\noperation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin\nAmerica\u2019s most legendary narco-traffickers. \u201cTse Chi Lop is in\nthe league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,\u201d said Jeremy\nDouglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC.\n\u201cThe word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no\ndoubt it applies here.\u201d\nReuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to\nquestions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan\u2019s Ministry\nof Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on\ninvestigations.\nDuring the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific\nto uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This\nincluded interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement\nofficials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence\nreports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings\nand other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in\nMyanmar\u2019s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia\u2019s Golden\nTriangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing\ndrugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited\nthe Thai compound of one of the syndicate\u2019s alleged drug lords.\nWhat emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly\ntransnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the\nAFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often\nrefer to as \u201cT1\u201d - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong,\nMacau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.\nThe syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and\nsophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin\nAmerican cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies\na bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a\nmore diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels\ndo, including Japan\u2019s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic\nChinese gangs across Southeast Asia.\nThe crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled\noutbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police\nsay. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked\nrivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a\nunited pursuit of gargantuan profits.\n\u201cThe crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate\nwith seamless efficiency,\u201d says one veteran Western anti-drugs\nofficial. \u201cThey function like a global corporation.\u201d\nLike most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed,\nthe investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.\nIn addition to the contrasts between their drug operations,\nthere\u2019s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop\nand Joaquin \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed\nMexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine\ntrafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their\nextravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has\nbeen revealed about Tse\u2019s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug\nlords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.\n\nA TRIP, A TRAP\nTse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern\nChina, and grew up during China\u2019s Cultural Revolution. Amid the\nbloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group\nof imprisoned members of Mao\u2019s Red Guard in the southern city of\nGuangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big\nCircle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police,\nand like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong\nKong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their\ncriminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.\nIn the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong,\nMacau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based\nin Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling\nring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless\nopium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand,\nChina and Laos meet.\nIn 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on\ndrug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New\nYork. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into\nAmerica, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over\nhis head.\nThrough a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged\nfor leniency.\nHis ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His\n12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed.\nIf freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed\n\u201cgreat sorrow\u201d for his crime, court records show.\nThe entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to\nnine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional\ninstitution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.\nAfter he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to\nCanada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for\nthe next four years. It\u2019s unclear when Tse returned to his old\nhaunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife\nregistered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company\nLtd, in Hong Kong in 2011.\nPolice suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He\n\u201cpicked up where he left off,\u201d said the senior AFP investigator.\nTse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and\nthe Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved\nirresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his\ndrug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no\nextra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.\nHis policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for\nbusiness, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011,\nAFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and\nmeth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather\nthan arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under\nsurveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely\nfor more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug\ncell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They\nwanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.\nThe syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other\ndrug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and\nselling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the\nsyndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the\nMelbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police\nwatched the Australian meet two men.\nOne of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted\nhair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese\nfamily man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance\nshowed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal\nsecurity. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of\nThai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eight\nworked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as\npart of his security protocol.\nTse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts\nand five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in\nprivate jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand\nfor a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt,\naccording to a member of the task force investigating the\nsyndicate.\nTse was a frequent visitor to Asia\u2019s casinos and fond of\nbetting on horses, especially on English races. \u201cWe believe he\nlost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the\ntables in Macau,\u201d said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.\nAs the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected\nthat the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia\nwith meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA,\ncommonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the\nSam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say,\nwhen a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of\nwhite powder strapped to each of his thighs.\n\n\u2018ALADDIN\u2019S CAVE OF INTEL\u2019\nCai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the\nairport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It\nwas the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous,\npicking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said\na former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation.\n\u201cHis hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,\u201d the\ncommander told Reuters. \u201cMethamphetamine is very toxic.\u201d\nCai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs\nwas a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful\ntranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. \u201cWe were very\nfortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,\u201d the\ncommander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been\nmonitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police\nhad no idea who he was.\nCai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a\n\u201cpesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,\u201d according to\nMyanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A\nfriend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father.\nCai\u2019s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for\nketamine at the airport, the commander said.\nUnimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight.\nThe next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport.\nOne recognized him from surveillance work he\u2019d been conducting.\nStill, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they\nlater found on one of his phones might have explained his\nsilence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least\nthree assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch\nand electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said\none investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy\nsaying \u201cLoyalty to the Heavens.\u201d The banner was a \u201ctriad-related\nsign,\u201d he added.\nThe tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed\nthe video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat\nbecause he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a\nlaw enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of\nthe victim\u2019s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad\nmembers were sending a message about the price of disloyalty,\nthe officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.\nThe torture videos were just one of the items allegedly\nfound in Cai\u2019s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was\na diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate\u2019s activities, but\nsloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones,\npolice say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media\nconversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.\nThey were \u201can Aladdin\u2019s Cave of intel,\u201d said one AFP\ncommander based in North Asia.\nFor at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly\ntravelled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for\nthe syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the\nDrug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its\ninvestigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip\nfrom an international courier company recording the delivery of\ntwo consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf\nChinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea\npackets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had\nbeen cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.\nTwo days after Cai\u2019s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon\naddress, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That\nevening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon\njetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so,\nMyanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but\nother than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate,\nincluding couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.\nThen came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery\nof photos and videos on Cai\u2019s phones, an AFP investigator based\nin Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing\nhe had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier.\n\u201cThis one stuck out because it was Canadian,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI\nsaid: \u2018Fuck, I know who you are!'\u201d\nIt was Tse Chi Lop.\nThe Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of\nintelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work\non Cai\u2019s phones.\nAustralia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime\ngangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade,\nthe AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and\nsmall, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent\ndescribed the database, which includes a trove of names,\nchemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and\nsurveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence\non Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.\nThe AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai\u2019s\nphones with the database. They discovered photos related to\nthree big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in\nChina, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators\nand Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese\nanti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and\naddresses in Cai\u2019s phones to other meth busts in China.\nFor regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations\nupended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by\ndifferent crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the\nwork of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics\nagent said they believed Cai was \u201cone of the members of a\nmega-syndicate,\u201d which had been involved in multiple \u201cdrugs\ncases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.\u201d\nCai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still\nin jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking\ncharges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to\ncontact Cai\u2019s lawyer.\n\nMETH PARADISE\nDuring his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing\nthe country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and\nobtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a\nbigger vessel in international waters, according to police and\nthe Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures\nof the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where\nthe meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.\nThe police reconstruction of Cai\u2019s dealings in Myanmar led\nto another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production\nhad shifted from China\u2019s southern provinces to Shan State in\nMyanmar\u2019s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had\nprovided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor\ningredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were\nsmuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in\nthe Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the\nfreedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.\nArmed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan\nState have long controlled large tracts of territory and used\ndrug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the\nmilitary. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar\ngovernment with rebel groups over the years has brought relative\ncalm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to\nflourish.\n\u201cProduction facilities can be hidden from law enforcement\nand other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,\u201d\nanalyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the\nInternational Crisis Group. \u201cDrug production and profits are now\nso vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.\u201d\nThe Myanmar government and police did not respond to\nquestions from Reuters.\nAlong the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there\nis evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts\na deep ravine known as the \u201cValley of Death,\u201d where ethnic\nKachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for\ndecades with Myanmar\u2019s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past\ntrucks carrying building materials and workers.\nThe Kaung Kha militia\u2019s immaculate and expansive new\nheadquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green\nhills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers\naway, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved\nout of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned\nout vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba\ntablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine.\nWhen it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more\nthan 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg\nof caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances\nused in drug production.\nThe Loikan facility was \u201cvery likely\u201d to have been the\nsource of much of the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s meth, said the\nYangon-based AFP officer.\n\u201cSome militia were involved in the lab,\u201d said Oi Khun, a\ncommunications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia,\nin an interview. He paused, then added: \u201cBut not with the\nknowledge of senior members\u201d of the militia.\nOne person in Loikan described how workers from the lab\nwould come down from the hills. The men, like most of the\nvillagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the\nlocals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.\n\u201cI asked them once. \u2018Why don\u2019t you bathe?\u2019\u201d the person said.\n\u201cThey said they did, but there was nothing they could do about\nthe smell.\u201d\nThe rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the\nskin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature\nstench might reveal their illicit activities. \u201cWe all knew,\u201d the\nperson said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t talk about it. That just brings you\ndanger.\u201d\nMeth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals,\nsay Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network\u2019s\ncouriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the\nAsia-Pacific.\nShan\u2019s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the\nworld, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told\nReuters. \u201cThey can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the\nground and let it dry.\u201d\nThe UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth\nis worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business\nmodel for meth is \u201cvery different\u201d to heroin, said the UNODC\u2019s\nDouglas. \u201cInputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not\nneeded, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore\nfar, far higher.\u201d\nThe wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in\nnortheastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a\nUNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control\nCommission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to\nthe UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand,\n$298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the\nJapanese market, that\u2019s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.\nThe money the syndicate is making \u201cmeans that if they lose\nten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,\u201d\nsaid the Chinese counter-narcotics official. \u201cThey can afford\nfailure. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u2018MONEY, MONEY\u2019\nThe analysis of Cai\u2019s phones was continuing to provide\nleads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the\npick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with\nMyanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at\nsea for weeks.\nOne of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the\nShun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement\ndocument reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea\nwhen, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a\nmarine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and\npaid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV\nValkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s\nand hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea\nsickness tablets. According to local media, he didn\u2019t have a\nfishing license at the time.\nAfter buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on\na course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in\nthe Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the\nrendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western\nAustralian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was\nseen \u201cunloading a lot of packages\u201d into a van, the commander\nsaid.\n\u201cWe knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of\norganized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and\ncomes back with some gear on it, that it hasn\u2019t just dropped\nfrom the sky in the middle of the ocean.\u201d\nInvestigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car\nhire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug\ntraffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say,\nthat some of Smith\u2019s alleged co-conspirators were members of an\nethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and\nComanchero motorcycle gangs, known as \u201cbikies\u201d in Australia.\nAs they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of\ncrystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor\nsyndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy\nof an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians\nreconvened in Perth a month later.\nBikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and\na self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had\nrefined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star\nhotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police\ninvestigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants,\nsaid the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth.\nThe restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that\nincluded caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.\nOn November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again,\nthis time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the\nAndaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth\nfrom Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast\nof the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the\nIndian Ocean.\nThe Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.\nWhen the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in\ninternational waters off the West Australian coast on December\n19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting \u201cmoney, money,\u201d\naccording to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De\nMan\u2019s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith\nand his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved\ntheir identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by\nthe crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.\nThe Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of\nGeraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The\nmen unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of\nthe AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault\nweapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty\nto importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of\nhis alleged associates are still on trial.\nTaiwan\u2019s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it\nhad \u201cworked together with our counterparts on the investigation\u201d\nof the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the \u201csubstantial\nseizure of illicit narcotics\u201d by the Australian authorities in\nDecember 2017. The bureau said it was \u201caware that Taiwanese\nsyndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in\n(the) Asia-Pacific region,\u201d and was working \u201ccollaboratively and\nclosely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and\ncross-border drug trafficking.\u201d\n\nNIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED\nAs the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police\nconcluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone\na kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the\nthree biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the\n1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The\nother two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse\u2019s original triad, and the\nBamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator,\nthe syndicate\u2019s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that\nit \u201cmust rival Apple\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cThe syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market\nto tap,\u201d said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior\ncolonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade.\n\u201cThe power this network possesses is unimaginable.\u201d\nInvestigators have had wins. In February last year, police\nbusted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough\ntea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66\nwas intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than\none tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor\nlieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar.\nIn December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected\nsyndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.\nLocated near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed\ncompound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used\nto experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a\n100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to\nthe back of the property.\nSue wasn\u2019t there, but property and money from 38 bank\naccounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized\nduring the investigation. Sue is still at large.\nBut the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the\nwider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal\nmeth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and\nSoutheast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in\nmost countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising\nseizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019,\n\u201csuggested the supply of the drug had expanded.\u201d\nIn the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive\nadversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug\nmotherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product\nin shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth\ncoming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the\nsyndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This\nincluded deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each\ncontaining about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on\nnarrow jungle paths.\nOver the years, police have had little success in taking\ndown Asia\u2019s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders\nhave been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to\nthe AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics\nkingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than\na short period was in the mid-1970s. That\u2019s when Ng Sik-ho, a\nwily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced\nto 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium\nand morphine, according to court records.\nSo far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho\u2019s fate. He is being\ntracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say\ncounter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they\nbelieve he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.\n(Reporting by Tom Allard. Additional reporting by Reuters\nStaff. Editing by Peter Hirschberg.)",

        "text": "By Tom Allard\nBANGKOK (Reuters) - He is Asia\u2019s most-wanted man. He is protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private jet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night at a Macau casino.\nTse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected of leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate formed out of an alliance of five of Asia\u2019s triad groups, according to law enforcement officials. Its members call it simply \u201cThe Company.\u201d Police, in a nod to one of Tse\u2019s nicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for \u201cBrother Number Three.\u201d\nThe syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of methamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen countries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South Pacific. But meth \u2013 a highly addictive drug with devastating physical and mental effects on long-term users \u2013 is its main business, they say.\nIn what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s meth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be as high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the cartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a 40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has expanded at least fourfold in the past five years.\nThis unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an unprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the prime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously unreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the Australian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about 20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far the biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug trafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in the investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar, China, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan, while not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the investigation.\nA document containing AFP profiles of the operation\u2019s top 19 syndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the leader of the syndicate. According to the document, the organization has \u201cbeen connected with or directly involved in at least 13 cases\u201d of drug trafficking since January 2015. The document does not provide specific details of the cases.\nA Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the \u201cMultinational CEO\u201d of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional government agencies says Tse is \u201cbelieved to be\u201d the leader of the Sam Gor syndicate.\nPolice have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected boss of the trafficking group.\nSome investigators say that the scope of the syndicate\u2019s operation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin America\u2019s most legendary narco-traffickers. \u201cTse Chi Lop is in the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,\u201d said Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC. \u201cThe word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no doubt it applies here.\u201d\nReuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to questions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on investigations.\nDuring the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific to uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This included interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement officials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence reports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings and other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in Myanmar\u2019s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia\u2019s Golden Triangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing drugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited the Thai compound of one of the syndicate\u2019s alleged drug lords.\nWhat emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly transnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the AFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often refer to as \u201cT1\u201d - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.\nThe syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and sophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin American cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies a bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a more diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels do, including Japan\u2019s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic Chinese gangs across Southeast Asia.\nThe crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled outbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police say. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked rivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a united pursuit of gargantuan profits.\n\u201cThe crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate with seamless efficiency,\u201d says one veteran Western anti-drugs official. \u201cThey function like a global corporation.\u201d\nLike most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed, the investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.\nIn addition to the contrasts between their drug operations, there\u2019s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop and Joaquin \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed Mexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine trafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their extravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has been revealed about Tse\u2019s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug lords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.\n\nA TRIP, A TRAP\nTse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern China, and grew up during China\u2019s Cultural Revolution. Amid the bloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group of imprisoned members of Mao\u2019s Red Guard in the southern city of Guangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big Circle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police, and like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong Kong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their criminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.\nIn the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong, Macau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based in Asia. He rose to become a\u00a0mid-ranking member of a smuggling ring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless opium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand, China and Laos meet.\nIn 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on drug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New York. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into America, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over his head.\nThrough a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged for leniency.\nHis ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His 12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed. If freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed \u201cgreat sorrow\u201d for his crime, court records show.\nThe entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to nine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional institution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.\nAfter he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to Canada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for the next four years. It\u2019s unclear when Tse returned to his old haunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife registered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company Ltd, in Hong Kong in 2011.\nPolice suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He \u201cpicked up where he left off,\u201d said the senior AFP investigator. Tse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and the Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved irresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his drug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no extra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.\nHis policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for business, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011, AFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and meth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather than arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under surveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely for more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug cell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They wanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.\nThe syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other drug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and selling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the syndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the Melbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police watched the Australian meet two men.\nOne of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted hair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese family man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance showed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal security. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators.\u00a0Up to eight worked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as part of his security protocol.\nTse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts and five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in private jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand for a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt, according to a member of the task force investigating the syndicate.\nTse was a frequent visitor to Asia\u2019s casinos and fond of betting on horses, especially on English races. \u201cWe believe he lost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the tables in Macau,\u201d said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.\nAs the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected that the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia with meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the Sam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say, when a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of white powder strapped to each of his thighs.\n\n\u2018ALADDIN\u2019S CAVE OF INTEL\u2019\nCai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the airport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It was the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous, picking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said a former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation. \u201cHis hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,\u201d the commander told Reuters. \u201cMethamphetamine is very toxic.\u201d\nCai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs was a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful tranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. \u201cWe were very fortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,\u201d the commander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been monitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police had no idea who he was.\nCai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a \u201cpesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,\u201d according to Myanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A friend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father. Cai\u2019s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for ketamine at the airport, the commander said.\nUnimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight. The next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport. One recognized him from surveillance work he\u2019d been conducting.\nStill, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they later found on one of his phones might have explained his silence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least three assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch and electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said one investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy saying \u201cLoyalty to the Heavens.\u201d The banner was a \u201ctriad-related sign,\u201d he added.\nThe tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed the video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat because he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a law enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of the victim\u2019s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad members were sending a message about the price of disloyalty, the officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.\nThe torture videos were just one of the items allegedly found in Cai\u2019s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was a diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate\u2019s activities, but sloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones, police say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media conversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.\nThey were \u201can Aladdin\u2019s Cave of intel,\u201d said one AFP commander based in North Asia.\nFor at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly traveled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for the syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the Drug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its investigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip from an international courier company recording the delivery of two consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf Chinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea packets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had been cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.\nTwo days after Cai\u2019s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon address, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That evening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon jetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so, Myanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but other than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate, including couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.\nThen came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery of photos and videos on Cai\u2019s phones,\u00a0an AFP investigator based in Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing he had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier. \u201cThis one stuck out because it was Canadian,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI said: \u2018Fuck, I know who you are!'\u201d\nIt was Tse Chi Lop.\nThe Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of intelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work on Cai\u2019s phones.\nAustralia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime gangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade, the AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and small, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent described the database, which includes a trove of names, chemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and surveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence on Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.\nThe AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai\u2019s phones with the database. They discovered photos related to three big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in China, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators and Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese anti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and addresses in Cai\u2019s phones to other meth busts in China.\nFor regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations upended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by different crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the work of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics agent said they believed Cai was \u201cone of the members of a mega-syndicate,\u201d which had been involved in multiple \u201cdrugs cases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.\u201d\nCai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still in jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking charges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to contact Cai\u2019s lawyer.\n\nMETH PARADISE\nDuring his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing the country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and obtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a bigger vessel in international waters, according to police and the Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures of the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where the meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.\nThe police reconstruction of Cai\u2019s dealings in Myanmar led to another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production had shifted from China\u2019s southern provinces to Shan State in Myanmar\u2019s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had provided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor ingredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were smuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the freedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.\nArmed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan State have long controlled large tracts of territory and used drug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the military. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar government with rebel groups over the years has brought relative calm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to flourish.\n\u201cProduction facilities can be hidden from law enforcement and other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,\u201d analyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the International Crisis Group. \u201cDrug production and profits are now so vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.\u201d\nThe Myanmar government and police did not respond to questions from Reuters.\nAlong the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there is evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts a deep ravine known as the \u201cValley of Death,\u201d where ethnic Kachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for decades with Myanmar\u2019s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past trucks carrying building materials and workers.\nThe Kaung Kha militia\u2019s immaculate and expansive new headquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green hills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers away, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved out of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned out vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba tablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine. When it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more than 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg of caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances used in drug production.\nThe Loikan facility was \u201cvery likely\u201d to have been the source of much of the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s meth, said the Yangon-based AFP officer.\n\u201cSome militia were involved in the lab,\u201d said Oi Khun, a communications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia, in an interview. He paused, then added: \u201cBut not with the knowledge of senior members\u201d of the militia.\nOne person in Loikan described how workers from the lab would come down from the hills. The men, like most of the villagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the locals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.\n\u201cI asked them once. \u2018Why don\u2019t you bathe?\u2019\u201d the person said. \u201cThey said they did, but there was nothing they could do about the smell.\u201d\nThe rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the skin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature stench might reveal their illicit activities. \u201cWe all knew,\u201d the person said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t talk about it. That just brings you danger.\u201d\nMeth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals, say Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network\u2019s couriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the Asia-Pacific.\nShan\u2019s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the world, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told Reuters. \u201cThey can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the ground and let it dry.\u201d\nThe UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth is worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business model for meth is \u201cvery different\u201d to heroin, said the UNODC\u2019s Douglas. \u201cInputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not needed, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore far, far higher.\u201d\nThe wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in northeastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a UNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control Commission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to the UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand, $298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the Japanese market, that\u2019s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.\nThe money the syndicate is making \u201cmeans that if they lose ten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,\u201d said the Chinese counter-narcotics official. \u201cThey can afford failure. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u2018MONEY, MONEY\u2019\nThe analysis of Cai\u2019s phones was continuing to provide leads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the pick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with Myanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at sea for weeks.\nOne of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the Shun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement document reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea when, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a marine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and paid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV Valkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s and hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea sickness tablets. According to local media, he didn\u2019t have a fishing license at the time.\nAfter buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on a course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in the Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the rendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western Australian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was seen \u201cunloading a lot of packages\u201d into a van, the commander said.\n\u201cWe knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of organized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and comes back with some gear on it, that it hasn\u2019t just dropped from the sky in the middle of the ocean.\u201d\nInvestigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car hire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug traffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say, that some of Smith\u2019s alleged co-conspirators were members of an ethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and Comanchero motorcycle gangs, known as \u201cbikies\u201d in Australia.\nAs they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of crystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor syndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy of an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians reconvened in Perth a month later.\nBikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and a self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had refined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star hotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police investigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants, said the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth. The restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that included caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.\nOn November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again, this time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the Andaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth from Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the Indian Ocean.\nThe Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.\nWhen the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in international waters off the West Australian coast on December 19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting \u201cmoney, money,\u201d according to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De Man\u2019s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith and his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved their identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by the crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.\nThe Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of Geraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The men unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of the AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault weapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty to importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of his alleged associates are still on trial.\nTaiwan\u2019s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it had \u201cworked together with our counterparts on the investigation\u201d of the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the \u201csubstantial seizure of illicit narcotics\u201d by the Australian authorities in December 2017. The bureau said it was \u201caware that Taiwanese syndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in (the) Asia-Pacific region,\u201d and was working \u201ccollaboratively and closely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and cross-border drug trafficking.\u201d\n\nNIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED\nAs the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police concluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone a kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the three biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the 1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The other two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse\u2019s original triad, and the Bamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator, the syndicate\u2019s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that it \u201cmust rival Apple\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cThe syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market to tap,\u201d said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior colonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade. \u201cThe power this network possesses is unimaginable.\u201d\nInvestigators have had wins. In February last year, police busted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough tea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66 was intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than one tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor lieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar. In December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected syndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.\nLocated near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed compound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used to experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a 100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to the back of the property.\nSue wasn\u2019t there, but property and money from 38 bank accounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized during the investigation. Sue is still at large.\nBut the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the wider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal meth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and Southeast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in most countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising seizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019, \u201csuggested the supply of the drug had expanded.\u201d\nIn the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive adversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug motherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product in shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth coming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the syndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This included deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each containing about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on narrow jungle paths.\nOver the years, police have had little success in taking down Asia\u2019s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders have been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to the AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics kingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than a short period was in the mid-1970s. That\u2019s when Ng Sik-ho, a wily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium and morphine, according to court records.\nSo far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho\u2019s fate. He is being tracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say counter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they believe he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.\n\n\n\n (Reporting by Tom Allard. Additional reporting by Reuters Staff. Editing by Peter Hirschberg.)",

        "text": "(For more Reuters Special Reports, click on)\nBy Tom Allard\nBANGKOK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - He is Asia\u2019s most-wanted man. He\nis protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private\njet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night\nat a Macau casino.\nTse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected\nof leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate\nformed out of an alliance of five of Asia\u2019s triad groups,\naccording to law enforcement officials. Its members call it\nsimply \u201cThe Company.\u201d Police, in a nod to one of Tse\u2019s\nnicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for \u201cBrother Number\nThree.\u201d\nThe syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of\nmethamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen\ncountries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South\nPacific. But meth \u2013 a highly addictive drug with devastating\nphysical and mental effects on long-term users \u2013 is its main\nbusiness, they say.\nIn what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations\nOffice on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s\nmeth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be\nas high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the\ncartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a\n40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has\nexpanded at least fourfold in the past five years.\nThis unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an\nunprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the\nprime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously\nunreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the\nAustralian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about\n20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far\nthe biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug\ntrafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in\nthe investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar,\nChina, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan,\nwhile not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the\ninvestigation.\nA document containing AFP profiles of the operation\u2019s top 19\nsyndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the\nleader of the syndicate. According to the document, the\norganization has \u201cbeen connected with or directly involved in at\nleast 13 cases\u201d of drug trafficking since January 2015. The\ndocument does not provide specific details of the cases.\nA Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the\n\u201cMultinational CEO\u201d of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement\nAdministration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional\ngovernment agencies says Tse is \u201cbelieved to be\u201d the leader of\nthe Sam Gor syndicate.\nPolice have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected\nboss of the trafficking group.\nSome investigators say that the scope of the syndicate\u2019s\noperation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin\nAmerica\u2019s most legendary narco-traffickers. \u201cTse Chi Lop is in\nthe league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,\u201d said Jeremy\nDouglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC.\n\u201cThe word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no\ndoubt it applies here.\u201d\nReuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to\nquestions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan\u2019s Ministry\nof Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on\ninvestigations.\nDuring the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific\nto uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This\nincluded interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement\nofficials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence\nreports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings\nand other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in\nMyanmar\u2019s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia\u2019s Golden\nTriangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing\ndrugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited\nthe Thai compound of one of the syndicate\u2019s alleged drug lords.\nWhat emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly\ntransnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the\nAFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often\nrefer to as \u201cT1\u201d - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong,\nMacau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.\nThe syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and\nsophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin\nAmerican cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies\na bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a\nmore diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels\ndo, including Japan\u2019s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic\nChinese gangs across Southeast Asia.\nThe crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled\noutbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police\nsay. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked\nrivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a\nunited pursuit of gargantuan profits.\n\u201cThe crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate\nwith seamless efficiency,\u201d says one veteran Western anti-drugs\nofficial. \u201cThey function like a global corporation.\u201d\nLike most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed,\nthe investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.\nIn addition to the contrasts between their drug operations,\nthere\u2019s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop\nand Joaquin \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed\nMexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine\ntrafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their\nextravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has\nbeen revealed about Tse\u2019s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug\nlords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.\n\nA TRIP, A TRAP\nTse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern\nChina, and grew up during China\u2019s Cultural Revolution. Amid the\nbloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group\nof imprisoned members of Mao\u2019s Red Guard in the southern city of\nGuangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big\nCircle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police,\nand like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong\nKong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their\ncriminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.\nIn the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong,\nMacau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based\nin Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling\nring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless\nopium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand,\nChina and Laos meet.\nIn 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on\ndrug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New\nYork. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into\nAmerica, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over\nhis head.\nThrough a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged\nfor leniency.\nHis ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His\n12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed.\nIf freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed\n\u201cgreat sorrow\u201d for his crime, court records show.\nThe entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to\nnine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional\ninstitution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.\nAfter he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to\nCanada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for\nthe next four years. It\u2019s unclear when Tse returned to his old\nhaunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife\nregistered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company\nLtd, in Hong Kong in 2011.\nPolice suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He\n\u201cpicked up where he left off,\u201d said the senior AFP investigator.\nTse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and\nthe Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved\nirresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his\ndrug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no\nextra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.\nHis policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for\nbusiness, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011,\nAFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and\nmeth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather\nthan arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under\nsurveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely\nfor more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug\ncell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They\nwanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.\nThe syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other\ndrug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and\nselling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the\nsyndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the\nMelbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police\nwatched the Australian meet two men.\nOne of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted\nhair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese\nfamily man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance\nshowed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal\nsecurity. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of\nThai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eight\nworked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as\npart of his security protocol.\nTse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts\nand five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in\nprivate jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand\nfor a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt,\naccording to a member of the task force investigating the\nsyndicate.\nTse was a frequent visitor to Asia\u2019s casinos and fond of\nbetting on horses, especially on English races. \u201cWe believe he\nlost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the\ntables in Macau,\u201d said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.\nAs the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected\nthat the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia\nwith meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA,\ncommonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the\nSam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say,\nwhen a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of\nwhite powder strapped to each of his thighs.\n\n\u2018ALADDIN\u2019S CAVE OF INTEL\u2019\nCai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the\nairport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It\nwas the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous,\npicking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said\na former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation.\n\u201cHis hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,\u201d the\ncommander told Reuters. \u201cMethamphetamine is very toxic.\u201d\nCai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs\nwas a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful\ntranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. \u201cWe were very\nfortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,\u201d the\ncommander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been\nmonitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police\nhad no idea who he was.\nCai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a\n\u201cpesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,\u201d according to\nMyanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A\nfriend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father.\nCai\u2019s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for\nketamine at the airport, the commander said.\nUnimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight.\nThe next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport.\nOne recognized him from surveillance work he\u2019d been conducting.\nStill, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they\nlater found on one of his phones might have explained his\nsilence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least\nthree assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch\nand electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said\none investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy\nsaying \u201cLoyalty to the Heavens.\u201d The banner was a \u201ctriad-related\nsign,\u201d he added.\nThe tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed\nthe video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat\nbecause he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a\nlaw enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of\nthe victim\u2019s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad\nmembers were sending a message about the price of disloyalty,\nthe officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.\nThe torture videos were just one of the items allegedly\nfound in Cai\u2019s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was\na diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate\u2019s activities, but\nsloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones,\npolice say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media\nconversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.\nThey were \u201can Aladdin\u2019s Cave of intel,\u201d said one AFP\ncommander based in North Asia.\nFor at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly\ntravelled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for\nthe syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the\nDrug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its\ninvestigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip\nfrom an international courier company recording the delivery of\ntwo consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf\nChinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea\npackets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had\nbeen cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.\nTwo days after Cai\u2019s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon\naddress, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That\nevening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon\njetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so,\nMyanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but\nother than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate,\nincluding couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.\nThen came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery\nof photos and videos on Cai\u2019s phones, an AFP investigator based\nin Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing\nhe had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier.\n\u201cThis one stuck out because it was Canadian,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI\nsaid: \u2018Fuck, I know who you are!'\u201d\nIt was Tse Chi Lop.\nThe Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of\nintelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work\non Cai\u2019s phones.\nAustralia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime\ngangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade,\nthe AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and\nsmall, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent\ndescribed the database, which includes a trove of names,\nchemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and\nsurveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence\non Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.\nThe AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai\u2019s\nphones with the database. They discovered photos related to\nthree big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in\nChina, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators\nand Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese\nanti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and\naddresses in Cai\u2019s phones to other meth busts in China.\nFor regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations\nupended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by\ndifferent crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the\nwork of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics\nagent said they believed Cai was \u201cone of the members of a\nmega-syndicate,\u201d which had been involved in multiple \u201cdrugs\ncases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.\u201d\nCai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still\nin jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking\ncharges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to\ncontact Cai\u2019s lawyer.\n\nMETH PARADISE\nDuring his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing\nthe country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and\nobtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a\nbigger vessel in international waters, according to police and\nthe Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures\nof the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where\nthe meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.\nThe police reconstruction of Cai\u2019s dealings in Myanmar led\nto another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production\nhad shifted from China\u2019s southern provinces to Shan State in\nMyanmar\u2019s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had\nprovided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor\ningredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were\nsmuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in\nthe Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the\nfreedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.\nArmed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan\nState have long controlled large tracts of territory and used\ndrug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the\nmilitary. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar\ngovernment with rebel groups over the years has brought relative\ncalm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to\nflourish.\n\u201cProduction facilities can be hidden from law enforcement\nand other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,\u201d\nanalyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the\nInternational Crisis Group. \u201cDrug production and profits are now\nso vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.\u201d\nThe Myanmar government and police did not respond to\nquestions from Reuters.\nAlong the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there\nis evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts\na deep ravine known as the \u201cValley of Death,\u201d where ethnic\nKachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for\ndecades with Myanmar\u2019s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past\ntrucks carrying building materials and workers.\nThe Kaung Kha militia\u2019s immaculate and expansive new\nheadquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green\nhills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers\naway, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved\nout of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned\nout vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba\ntablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine.\nWhen it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more\nthan 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg\nof caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances\nused in drug production.\nThe Loikan facility was \u201cvery likely\u201d to have been the\nsource of much of the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s meth, said the\nYangon-based AFP officer.\n\u201cSome militia were involved in the lab,\u201d said Oi Khun, a\ncommunications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia,\nin an interview. He paused, then added: \u201cBut not with the\nknowledge of senior members\u201d of the militia.\nOne person in Loikan described how workers from the lab\nwould come down from the hills. The men, like most of the\nvillagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the\nlocals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.\n\u201cI asked them once. \u2018Why don\u2019t you bathe?\u2019\u201d the person said.\n\u201cThey said they did, but there was nothing they could do about\nthe smell.\u201d\nThe rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the\nskin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature\nstench might reveal their illicit activities. \u201cWe all knew,\u201d the\nperson said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t talk about it. That just brings you\ndanger.\u201d\nMeth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals,\nsay Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network\u2019s\ncouriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the\nAsia-Pacific.\nShan\u2019s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the\nworld, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told\nReuters. \u201cThey can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the\nground and let it dry.\u201d\nThe UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth\nis worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business\nmodel for meth is \u201cvery different\u201d to heroin, said the UNODC\u2019s\nDouglas. \u201cInputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not\nneeded, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore\nfar, far higher.\u201d\nThe wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in\nnortheastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a\nUNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control\nCommission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to\nthe UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand,\n$298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the\nJapanese market, that\u2019s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.\nThe money the syndicate is making \u201cmeans that if they lose\nten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,\u201d\nsaid the Chinese counter-narcotics official. \u201cThey can afford\nfailure. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u2018MONEY, MONEY\u2019\nThe analysis of Cai\u2019s phones was continuing to provide\nleads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the\npick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with\nMyanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at\nsea for weeks.\nOne of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the\nShun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement\ndocument reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea\nwhen, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a\nmarine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and\npaid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV\nValkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s\nand hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea\nsickness tablets. According to local media, he didn\u2019t have a\nfishing license at the time.\nAfter buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on\na course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in\nthe Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the\nrendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western\nAustralian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was\nseen \u201cunloading a lot of packages\u201d into a van, the commander\nsaid.\n\u201cWe knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of\norganized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and\ncomes back with some gear on it, that it hasn\u2019t just dropped\nfrom the sky in the middle of the ocean.\u201d\nInvestigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car\nhire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug\ntraffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say,\nthat some of Smith\u2019s alleged co-conspirators were members of an\nethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and\nComanchero motorcycle gangs, known as \u201cbikies\u201d in Australia.\nAs they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of\ncrystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor\nsyndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy\nof an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians\nreconvened in Perth a month later.\nBikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and\na self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had\nrefined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star\nhotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police\ninvestigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants,\nsaid the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth.\nThe restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that\nincluded caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.\nOn November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again,\nthis time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the\nAndaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth\nfrom Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast\nof the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the\nIndian Ocean.\nThe Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.\nWhen the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in\ninternational waters off the West Australian coast on December\n19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting \u201cmoney, money,\u201d\naccording to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De\nMan\u2019s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith\nand his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved\ntheir identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by\nthe crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.\nThe Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of\nGeraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The\nmen unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of\nthe AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault\nweapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty\nto importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of\nhis alleged associates are still on trial.\nTaiwan\u2019s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it\nhad \u201cworked together with our counterparts on the investigation\u201d\nof the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the \u201csubstantial\nseizure of illicit narcotics\u201d by the Australian authorities in\nDecember 2017. The bureau said it was \u201caware that Taiwanese\nsyndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in\n(the) Asia-Pacific region,\u201d and was working \u201ccollaboratively and\nclosely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and\ncross-border drug trafficking.\u201d\n\nNIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED\nAs the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police\nconcluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone\na kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the\nthree biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the\n1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The\nother two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse\u2019s original triad, and the\nBamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator,\nthe syndicate\u2019s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that\nit \u201cmust rival Apple\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cThe syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market\nto tap,\u201d said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior\ncolonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade.\n\u201cThe power this network possesses is unimaginable.\u201d\nInvestigators have had wins. In February last year, police\nbusted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough\ntea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66\nwas intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than\none tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor\nlieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar.\nIn December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected\nsyndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.\nLocated near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed\ncompound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used\nto experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a\n100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to\nthe back of the property.\nSue wasn\u2019t there, but property and money from 38 bank\naccounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized\nduring the investigation. Sue is still at large.\nBut the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the\nwider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal\nmeth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and\nSoutheast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in\nmost countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising\nseizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019,\n\u201csuggested the supply of the drug had expanded.\u201d\nIn the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive\nadversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug\nmotherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product\nin shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth\ncoming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the\nsyndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This\nincluded deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each\ncontaining about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on\nnarrow jungle paths.\nOver the years, police have had little success in taking\ndown Asia\u2019s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders\nhave been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to\nthe AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics\nkingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than\na short period was in the mid-1970s. That\u2019s when Ng Sik-ho, a\nwily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced\nto 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium\nand morphine, according to court records.\nSo far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho\u2019s fate. He is being\ntracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say\ncounter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they\nbelieve he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.\n(Reporting by Tom Allard. Additional reporting by Reuters\nStaff. Editing by Peter Hirschberg.)",

        "text": "By Umberto Bacchi\nCOPENHAGEN, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From\nelectric buses to pollution-sucking urban gardens, cities around\nthe world are experimenting with ways to ensure global climate\ngoals are met, as they account for about three-quarters of\nplanet-warming emissions, according to the United Nations.\nHere are seven award-winning initiatives to make cities\ngreener, announced by the C40 network of cities tackling climate\nchange on Thursday:\n\n1. MEDELLIN, Colombia - Colombia's second city has invested\nmore\nthan $16 million to plant almost 9,000 trees to form 30 \"green\ncorridors\" across the city since 2016. Besides capturing\npollution, the plants have helped reduce average temperatures in\nthe city by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) and increased\nbiodiversity, providing friendly habitats for animals.\n2. ACCRA, Ghana - Since 2016, Accra has been working with\nmore than\n600 informal refuse collectors, who used to dump rubbish that\nwas burned at illegal open-air sites, causing pollution. More\nwaste is now being collected, recycled and disposed of safely.\n3. KOLKATA, India - Kolkata is planning to have its entire\n5,000-strong bus fleet, as well as ferries crossing the Ganges\nRiver, run on electricity by 2030. It has bought 80 electric\nbuses and plans to add another 100 next year.\n4. LONDON, United Kingdom - London introduced the world's\nfirst\nUltra Low Emission Zone in 2019, requiring all vehicles passing\nthrough the city centre to meet strict emissions standards or\npay a fee. Within months, the number of more polluting vehicles\nfell by a third as people were pushed to walk, cycle or use\npublic transport.\n5. SAN FRANCISCO, United States - San Francisco's\nCleanPowerSF\nprogramme allows residents to get their electricity completely\nor in large part from renewable sources at competitive rates.\nThe city hopes this will help it achieve a goal of reducing\ngreenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2025.\n6. GUANGZHOU, China - Since 2017, Guangzhou has invested\n$2.1\nbillion to convert its entire fleet of 11,220 buses to run on\nelectricity and installed some 4,000 charging stations to power\nthem. This has reduced air pollution and noise as well as the\ncity's transport system operational costs.\n7. SEOUL, South Korea - Seoul has subsidised the\ninstallation of\nsolar panels on balconies and rooftops of 1 million homes since\n2017, as well as city buildings like schools and parking lots.\nThe city hopes to produce up to 1 GW of solar energy - equal to\nthat generated by a nuclear reactor - by 2022.\nSources: C40, Transport for London, Thomson Reuters\nFoundation\n(Reporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Katy\nMigiro.

Debt\nbondage is what we are trying to tackle,\" Law said.\nMigrant rights groups welcomed the initiative but warned its\nimplementation could be problematic as countries such as\nIndonesia would only allow workers to go abroad through its\nlocally-approved agencies.\n\"It could be quite chaotic for the sending country because\nthey want to monitor the whereabouts of the workers,\" said Alex\nOng from advocacy group Migrant Care, which campaigns for\nmigrant workers in Malaysia.\nRecruitment agencies are not allowed to charge workers in\nthe formal sectors - such as manufacturing and plantation - fees\nthat are higher one month's salary, under current guidelines set\nby the employers' group, the Malaysian Employers' Federation.\nBut domestic workers are excluded from the clause, and\ntypically have to spend six months with almost all their wages\ndeducted to cover the costs they owe the recruiters for local\ntravel or medical tests, said Ong.\n\"The question is why this protection is not applicable for\ndomestic workers too,\" asked Ong, calling for a legal reform.\nMalaysia is home to an estimated 212,000 of about 40 million\npeople trapped in modern slavery worldwide, according to the\nGlobal Slavery Index by human rights group Walk Free Foundation.\n($1 = 4.1910 ringgit)\n(Reporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi; Editing by Michael Taylor.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

At 6 p.m. local time (2300 GMT),\nresults showed about half of those eligible had voted.\nDespite hiccups at some of the country's 11,590 polling\nplaces - including landslides that delayed the start of voting\nat three locations - Sunday's vote was the most peaceful of\nrecent local and regional elections, the head of the national\nregistry office said.\n\"They have been the most peaceful territorial elections in\nrecent years, they have been territorial elections where\nColombians have been able to vote in all polling places,\" Juan\nCarlos Galindo told reporters shortly after voting ended at 4\nP.M. local time (2100 GMT).\nThe outcome of other races was likely to reflect the power\nof political families rather than parties, analysts told Reuters\nahead of the voting, especially as many candidates are backed by\ncoalitions.\nIt is not unusual for disparate factions to unite behind\ncandidates for local elections in Colombia, giving local\npower-brokers more sway with eventual 2022 presidential\ncontenders to negotiate benefits for their areas.\nThe mayorship of the Caribbean port city of Barranquilla\nwent to Jaime Pumarejo, backed by powerful political kingmakers,\nthe Char family.\nNicolas Petro, son of left-wing 2018 presidential candidate\nGustavo Petro, was in a distant second for the governorship of\nAtlantico province.\nPetro's pick for Bogota mayor came in third with around 14%\nof the vote, less than 1% ahead of the candidate backed by\nPresident Ivan Duque's right-wing Democratic Center party.\nDuring campaigning seven candidates were killed, a dozen\nattacked and more than 100 threatened, the Electoral Observation\nMission (MOE), a voting rights group, has said.

The temptation is always\nthere,\" said 21-year-old Carmona.\nYet against the odds, Carmona landed a job last year as a\nsoftware tester with the Medellin office of Arbusta, an\nArgentine tech company that does social good.\nHe is one of about 30 young men and women hired by Arbusta,\nwhich aims to give jobs to unemployed people from poor\nbackgrounds, with no work experience or university education.\nArbusta and 80 other companies, including local and foreign\nsocial enterprises, have set up shop at Ruta N, a\ngovernment-funded innovation center in the city of 2.5 million\npeople once known as the world's murder capital.\nSince then Ruta N has emerged as a leading hub for social\nentrepreneurship in Latin America, making the city one of\nworld's hot spots for social entrepreneurs according to a\nThomson Reuters Foundation poll on Tuesday.\n\"Here there's significant political will to drive social\ninnovation and entrepreneurship,\" said Maria Ines Londono,\nArbusta country manager. \"Ruta N is an oasis in the midst of\ndifficult neighborhoods.\"\nThe Thomson Reuters Foundation's second global poll of\nexperts on the best countries for social entrepreneurs,\nsupported by Deutsche Bank, found Medellin among the top four\ncity hot spots for business leaders seeking to do good.\nThe three others were Berlin, London, and Santiago.\nIn the inaugural poll in 2016, experts named Berlin, London,\nHong Kong, and Santiago as the global city hot spots.\n\nVIOLENT HISTORY\nIt is a big turnaround for Medellin, the epicenter of\nColombia's drug wars of the 1980s.\n\"We've had to become resilient and work together to move the\ncity forward, which creates a conducive environment for\nentrepreneurship,\" said Alejandro Franco, head of Ruta N,\nsitting in a co-working place in the building.\nScattered across a warren of slum areas are numerous\nexamples of Medellin's social innovation, driven by consecutive\nmayors over the past two decades and funded by city hall.\nNew schools, public libraries, open-air gyms and landscaped\nparks have been built in once once-neglected, no-go slum areas.\nMedellin's much copied cable car transport system ferries\nresidents up and down hillsides, connecting slum dwellers with\nthe rest of the city in a quick and affordable way.\nSocial entrepreneur Matt Alexander said Medellin's tradition\nof innovation and entrepreneurship were key reasons for locating\nhis U.S. company's international headquarters there.\n\"We wanted to be in an environment where public officials\nand others were accustomed to pushing the envelope in terms of\nthinking of new solutions for old problems,\" said the co-founder\nof Suyo, which uses technology to help poor families formalize\ntheir land and property titles.\nRuta N has supported dozens of social and tech businesses\nover the past decade by offering free mentoring opportunities\nand workshops on finance and technology, and help with access to\nfunding and low-interest loans.\n\"Ruta N is a hub that allows you to connect. It helps being\nunder one roof,\" said Andres Castellon, finance director at\nlikeU, a Colombian outsourcing and call center business that\nemploys women and single mothers from poor neighborhoods.\nWhile Medellin fared well in the poll as a hot spot,\nColombia's overall ranking in the list of best countries for\nsocial entrepreneurs dropped 25 places from three years ago to\n39 out of 43 countries.\nIn Colombia, social enterprise is a relatively new concept,\nemerging about five years ago. Experts said many businesses had\nset up in an informal way without government support.\nColombia does not define social enterprises by law as\nbusinesses with specific legal and tax treatment.\nPaula Zapata, who heads the Medellin mayor's office for\neconomic development, said the city's violent past had led to a\ntradition of the public sector, mayor, business leaders and\nuniversities coming together to solve social problems.\nThis has forged an environment where social entrepreneurs\ncan build partnerships with local government and academia.\n\"In the midst of adversity is when creativity emerges, it is\nwhen social innovation is born,\" Zapata said.\n(Reporting by Anastasia Moloney @anastasiabogota, Editing by\nBelinda Goldsmith\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

        "text": "By Anastasia Moloney\nBOGOTA, Oct 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Mothers of\nyoung men and teenagers who say their sons were murdered by\ngovernment soldiers during Colombia's conflict begged a tribunal\nfor answers on Thursday as the country investigates human rights\natrocities committed during its war.\nColombia's five-decade war pitted leftist rebels against\ngovernment forces and right-wing paramilitary groups. Some\n200,000 people were killed, 7.7 million displaced and 60,000\nlisted as missing, according to government figures.\nA 2016 peace accord between the government and\nRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels established\na Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) tribunal which is\ninvestigating war crimes.\nIts aims including uncovering what happened during\nColombia's war and prosecuting FARC leaders and state military\nofficials accused of human rights abuses.\nWearing T-shirts with photos of their missing sons as\nhandmade quilts and posters commemorating the dead lined the\nBogota courtroom's walls, a dozen mothers and other relatives\ndescribed their long quest for justice before three judges.\n\"I want to know the truth about what happened to my son, who\ndid it and why. Who took him away?,\" said Beatriz Mendez, whose\n19-year-old son and a nephew disappeared in 2004.\n\"I've been waiting for more than a decade for justice. There\nwill be divine justice,\" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation\nas other mothers hugged and wiped away tears.\nThe rights abuses are among the so-called \"false positives\"\nscandal that rocked Colombia in the late 2000s, when army units\nwere found to have killed civilians and listed them as\nguerrillas killed in combat to inflate casualty numbers.\nSome officers accused of involvement have appeared before\nthe JEP tribunal, while dozens of soldiers and officers have\nbeen convicted of crimes tied to the scandal since 2008 and are\nin prison. Dozens more have been fired.\nColombia's attorney general's office is also investigating\nnearly 2,300 similar cases of alleged extra-judicial killings\nwhen victims, some as young as 16, were often lured from their\nhomes in Bogota's slum neighborhoods by the promise of work.\n\"Our duty is to reach those who are the most responsible,\"\njudge Catalina Diaz told the hearing.\n\nREDUCED JAILED SENTENCES\nThe peace accord allows for former rebels and others who\ncome forward to receive reduced sentences and avoid prison if\nthey confess to crimes and repay victims, including any land and\nproperty seizures.\nThose admitting to war crimes will be sentenced to five to\neight years of \"alternative punishment\". What that will mean in\nreality remains unclear, but options could include community\nservice, restricted freedom or house arrest.\nThose who neither confess nor accept responsibility and are\nfound guilty could face up to 20 years in jail.\nThe peace accord has been criticized by some Colombians who\ndemand tougher sanctions and jail for FARC rebels.\nBut judge Ivan Gonzalez emphasized that the JEP is focused\non ensuring victims learn the truth about what happened and\nreceive reparations as outlined in the peace accord.\n\"The more truth and reparations there are, the less jail\ntime there is,\" he said.\nBesides extra-judicial killings, judges are sifting through\nthousands of victim testimonies and investigating select cases\nas most representative of the atrocities, including kidnapping\nand the recruitment of children as fighters into FARC ranks.\n\"In the case of (child) recruitment we have 8,800 cases, so\nto investigate this really takes a long time,\" Gonzalez said.\nHe said it is hoped the JEP can build a case on the use of\nsexual violence by FARC rebels, including forced abortions\nagainst women and girls in guerrilla ranks, and examine whether\nguerrillas used rape as a weapon of war.\n\n\n(Reporting by Anastasia Moloney @anastasiabogota, Editing by\nChris Michaud.

        "text": "By Kim Harrisberg and Anastasia Moloney\nJOHANNESBURG/ MEDELLIN, Oct 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation)\n- M othibi Pheko's gun rested across his bullet-proof vest as he\npatrolled a lush Johannesburg suburb backed by an array of\nhigh-tech tools to combat South Africa's notoriously violent\nthieves.\nAs he pulled over to check on residents, staff in the nearby\ncontrol room monitored surveillance camera feeds from around the\nproperties.\n\"We are proactive when it comes to crime prevention, not\nonly reactive,\" said Pheko, who works with local security firm\n7Arrows, pointing out several closed-circuit television (CCTV)\ncameras on different corners of the Sandown gated community.\n\"Every person has a right to be safe.\"\nA growing number of cities worldwide are using advanced CCTV\nsystems and forensic tools like DNA databases to tackle crime,\nraising concerns that privacy is being lost while criminals are\nmerely being pushed to poorer areas with less surveillance.\nSecurity experts say state-of-the-art gadgets are no\nsubstitute for efforts to address underlying causes of crime,\nsuch as high unemployment and inequality, or to reform corrupt\nand overburdened law enforcement agencies.\nTo speed up its response, 7Arrows buys live footage from\n1,500 CCTV cameras around Johannesburg - set to increase to\n15,000 by February - that can read licence plates in high\ndefinition and use thermal detectors for poor visibility.\n\"Vumacam's vetted clients who have access to view our feed\ncan choose to overlay a number of software options that will\nhelp generate alerts,\" said Ricky Croock, chief executive\nofficer of Vumacam which is rolling out the cameras.\n\"Analytic software filters out 95% of footage and only\nunusual behaviour is sent to clients who then decide whether to\ndispense a security vehicle.\"\n\nFALSE SECURITY\nSouth Africa has one the world's biggest private security\nindustries, with more than 9,000 registered companies and\n450,000 active guards, according to the Private Security\nIndustry Regulatory Authority - far outstripping police numbers.\nBarbed wire, electric fences and panic buttons are a part of\neveryday life in a country with more than 20,000 murders a year\n- the world's fifth highest murder rate in 2019, according to\nthe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.\nSenior officials have compared parts of South Africa to a\nwar zone. The army was deployed to seal off part of Cape Town in\nJuly to rein in a spate of gang-related killings.\n\"South Africans absolutely normalise what is crazy for\nanyone else,\" said Mandy Pienaar, a Johannesburg media executive\nwho three years ago was hijacked in her car and robbed at\ngunpoint.\n\"We do have a very false sense of security living behind our\nwalls, with our alarms and our big guard dogs.\"\nTech innovations like Vumacam's CCTV roll out have attracted\ncriticism from civil rights groups in South Africa who say they\nrisk worsening the divide between rich and poor - in what is\nalready the world's most unequal country by income, according to\nthe World Bank.\n\"Those that can afford to are turning more to private\nsecurity who are essentially making a profit out of crime,\" said\nThami Nkosi from the Right2Know organisation, which has raised\nconcerns about people being surveilled without consent.\n\"CCTV cameras don't reduce crime, they displace crime ...\nThey just make criminals more sophisticated: they will put on\nbalaclavas, use inside contacts, speed up their pace. We are not\ndealing with the root causes of crime.\"\n\nPEACE OF MIND\nHalfway across the globe, Colombia's second city of Medellin\nhas a different model for fighting crime. Once Colombia's murder\ncapital, former no-go slums now boast open-air gyms, hillside\ncable cars and community halls where youth orchestras play.\nIn the past decade, city mayors have invested hundreds of\nmillions of dollars in social development projects and urban\nrenewal to help bridge the gap between rich and poor and reclaim\nareas that were once controlled by gangs.\nThere are fewer night-time gun battles since the death in\n1993 of city drug lord Pablo Escobar, who ran the world's\nlargest cocaine cartel, though gang violence hotspots persist.\nMedellin's crime prevention approach focuses on finding\nalternatives to keep teenagers off the streets and away from\ngangs who - often with the nicest clothes, motorbikes and money\nin their pockets from drug dealing - can easily lure them in.\nAbout 3,000 young people in Medellin belong to gangs or risk\nbeing recruited, according to the mayor's office. Often armed\nand fighting over turf, neighbourhood gangs control drug\ntrafficking and extortion and prostitution rackets.\nSix months ago, Johan Rodriguez received an unexpected knock\non the door from social workers at his home in a gang-ridden\nMedellin hillside slum offering him work or training as part of\na new programme to keep vulnerable young people away from crime.\n\"I was mixed up with the gangs then and I was consuming\ndrugs,\" said 25-year-old Rodriguez, one of nearly 1,000 young\npeople aged between 10 and 28 taking part in the \"Parceros\" or\n\"Mates\" project, which city hall launched last year.\nIt offers support to go back to school, get job interviews\nand set up small businesses, from textile to DJ companies, as\nwell as activities that help young people make friends across\nthe invisible borders that divide gang territory.\n\"While the violence is always there, the project showed me\nthere's something else around the corner, another way. It opened\nup my eyes,\" said Rodriguez, who works in a motorbike factory\nafter social workers sent his CV to employers across the city.\n\"What I liked the most is that it taught me if you were\nviolent, you felt powerful on the street. But I learned that a\nperson is powerful when they have a peace of mind inside and are\nhappy with themselves.\"\nThe programme includes yoga, breathing exercises to deal\nwith anger, and challenges including diving into a swimming pool\ncovered with ice and walking over hot coals.\n\"The point of the exercises is to show us that we can\nachieve goals and overcome our fears,\" Rodriguez said.\n\nSUCCESS STORIES\nColombia and South Africa are both highly unequal countries\nstruggling to find ways to move on from violent pasts and reduce\nwidespread corruption and unemployment.\nCommunity projects like the 'i was shot in joburg :)' shop,\nwhich sells photos taken by homeless children at risk of drugs\nand gang violence, seek to provide alternatives to crime.\nIn Pheko's Diepsloot township, 30 km north of Sandown where\nhe works, people pay 20 rand ($1.30) a month for community-run\npatrols.\n\"We see projects come and go if they are functioning in\nisolation,\" said Stewart Barret, director of Navan Consulting,\nwhich analyses future trends in South Africa, calling for better\ntrained police, more jobs and well-functioning schools.\nSecurity innovations like Vumacam and Aura - a mobile\nplatform which summons armed responders - are looking to work\nmore closely with the police.\n\"We know that without the improvement of social and economic\nissues in the country, we are simply repeatedly filling a broken\ncup,\" said Warren Myers, founder of Aura.\nThe police are working on a pilot project with private\nsecurity companies, said police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu\nNaidoo, declining to give more details due to confidentiality.\n\"The South African Police Service welcomes and encourages\nthe involvement of private security in the fight against crime,\"\nhe said. \"They complement our efforts.\"\nMeanwhile, South Africans are doing whatever they can to\nfeel safer, said Jason Mordecai, managing director of 7Arrows.\n\"People are building their own camera surveillance with\nequipment bought online. They are using Whatapp groups to share\ninformation,\" he said.\n\"The irony is that sometimes the security walls become so\nhigh that you never speak to your neighbours. We become more and\nmore anonymous to one another as we try to hide from crime.\"\nBack in Sandown, Pheko hit the accelerator as an alarm went\noff in a nearby house. As he leapt out of his car, his radio\nbuzzed.\n\"False alarm,\" he said, adjusting his gun to continue his\ndaily patrol.\n($1 = 15.2369 rand)\n(Reporting by Kim Harrisberg @kimharrisberg in Johannesburg and\nAnastasia Moloney in Bogota; Editing by Katy Migiro.

        "text": "By Zoe Tabary\nLONDON, Oct 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Driverless\ntransport, underground shops, heated bike paths, armed street\npatrols \u2013 this is not the setting for a dystopian novel but it\ncould soon be the city where you live.\nAs the world sees the biggest wave of urban growth in\nhistory \u2013 with almost 70% of its population expected to be\nliving in urban areas by 2050, up from 56% today \u2013 the task of\nmaking cities greener and safer is becoming more urgent.\nThat cities are attracting more people is nothing new, noted\nurban specialist Philipp Rode, who runs London-based research\ncentre LSE Cities.\n\"People move to cities to live and work because they're a\nsolution: they significantly reduce the amount of movement and\nspace required to do anything,\" he told the Thomson Reuters\nFoundation.\n\"But the absolute increase in population, the millions\ncoming into cities - that's unprecedented.\"\nThe shift is creating significant challenges for many cities\nalready at risk from worsening climate change and rising\ninequality, with the race on to house swelling populations and\ntackle homelessness.\nTo cope with these modern-day pressures, cities around the\nworld are trying to become \"smarter\" - from moving storage and\nretail facilities underground, to using data and technology to\nimprove security, healthcare and mobility.\nMany cities, particularly in poorer nations, are also facing\nlarge and expanding slum populations which lack basic services,\nfueling inequality, and, in some cases, violence.\nMandy Pienaar, a 43-year-old media executive from\nJohannesburg, knows this only too well.\nOne winter evening, as she and her boyfriend drove home from\nthe movies in the South African city, two armed assailants\nhijacked their car, stripped them of their clothing and stole\ntheir bank cards before the couple managed to escape.\n\"It was quite shocking because there were a lot of people\nwalking past who kind of looked at me as if this was an everyday\noccurrence, to see a stripped woman sitting in a slum area in\nthe cold,\" Pienaar recalled.\nTheir ordeal illustrates the \"false sense of security\" that\ncomes with living as they do in a gated community, she said.\n\"We have bars on every window, huge dogs, electric fencing\n... to us that's normal. We've become desensitised.\"\nCommunity-led projects like \"vuvuzela patrols\" aim to tackle\nsuch violence, with groups of men armed with plastic trumpets\nescorting women on their daily commutes in Johannesburg.\nBut security is not the only worry on urban planners' minds.\nFrom the small U.S. city of Duluth to the metropolis of Hong\nKong, cities are thrashing out ways to reinvent themselves and\nrevamp how their residents live, move and consume.\n\"Mobility, water, waste: the world's greatest challenges are\nsolved in cities,\" said Tiina Kaho, head of the Helsinki\nMetropolitan Smart & Clean Foundation, a coalition of\nbusinesses, researchers and state officials.\nYet as the world transforms rapidly, \"cities will have to\ninnovate like never before\", she said.\n\nGOING UNDERGROUND\nFrom Singapore to sub-Saharan Africa, cities are running out\nof space to house swelling populations.\n\"It's a scarce resource,\" said Rode. \"Using that space in\nthe most efficient way possible is crucial.\"\nHistorically cities have tended to grow outwards rather than\nupwards, according to a report published by the World Resources\nInstitute and Yale University in January.\nBut, if uncontrolled, such expansion can make it challenging\nto deliver basic services, with trips to school or the doctor\nbecoming longer, for example. At the same time, it eats into\nfarmland and can threaten green areas and biodiversity.\nTo be sustainable, cities will need to temper their sprawl\nwith efforts to increase density, researchers said.\nIn Britain, for example, the government announced plans to\nbuild hundreds of thousands of new rural homes along its 'Green\nBelt' - protected areas in the English countryside.\nFor other cities, increasing density will mean putting more\nfacilities below ground - not just subway networks and utilities\nbut commercial, retail and storage facilities too.\nIn Hong Kong, known for its towering skyscrapers and wooded\nhills, there is a particular urgency to maximise use of\nunderground space, with home and land prices among the world's\nhighest.\nThe government has vowed to free more space for housing\nthrough measures like building artificial islands.\nIt is also looking to use underground spaces for waste\ntreatment, data centres, water reservoirs, power stations,\ncrematoriums and sports facilities.\n\"For the city, it results in more efficient use of space ...\nand avoids the conflicts of traffic and weather disruptions\nabove ground,\" said Mark Wallace, director of infrastructure at\nArup, a consultancy that studied underground space in Hong Kong.\nOther cities have also gone underground, with Finland's\ncapital Helsinki moving sports facilities and emergency shelters\nbelow the surface. Canada's Montreal, meanwhile, has a wide\npedestrian network of shops and hotels beneath its streets.\nIn December billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk unveiled a\n1.14-mile (1.8 km) tunnel in the Los Angeles area that was dug\nwith new fast, low-cost technology, as a first step to\ndeveloping a high-speed subterranean network for vehicles.\nWhile excavating and building underground is more expensive,\nthere are savings in maintenance and land costs, Wallace said.\nBut underground living is no replacement for better land-use\nplanning, researchers warned, while residents worry construction\nand access to buried facilities will eat into green space above.\nEuan Mills, urban design and planning lead at Future Cities\nCatapult, a UK-funded innovation centre, said cities should\n\"accommodate nature, but not at the expense of density\".\nFor him, the answer lies in building skywards.\n\"Human bodies need daylight, so going underground won't\nwork,\" he said.\n\nSAFE CITIES\nAs cities seek space to grow, they must also consider how\ntheir development affects social equality, said Rode of LSE\nCities.\n\"In fast-expanding cities the differences between rich and\npoor increase,\" he said.\nNeighbourhoods tend to display income disparities, leaving\nsome with better access to services, and leading to what Rode\ncalled \"anti-urban gestures\" such as gated communities.\nIn South Africa, the legacy of apartheid-era city planning\nand rapid urban population growth have contributed to making it\nthe most unequal country by income, according to the World Bank.\nSouth Africa's cities remain for the most part racially\ndivided more than 20 years after the end of apartheid, under\nwhich millions of black people were forcibly removed from\nwhite-only urban areas to live in crowded townships and\nhomelands, with buffer zones separating the races.\nThose patterns of inequality can stoke grievances, according\nto urban analysts, with South Africa \u2013 which has one of the\nworld's highest murder rates \u2013 in July deploying the army to\nquell a surge in violence in gang-infested parts of Cape Town.\nThat has led to a proliferation of private security firms,\nsuch as safety start-up Aura, which created a mobile platform\nallowing customers to access a network of armed emergency\nservices.\n\"The police are stretched thin,\" said Warren Myers, founder\nof Aura, which has received about 25 panic alerts a day from its\n70,000 users since its launch in 2017.\n\"We need to marry as many different technologies as possible\n- CCTV, facial recognition, data collection, WhatsApp groups -\nto better protect South Africans,\" he added.\nBut private security is hardly sufficient to tackle crime,\nanalysts warned, as realised by cities in Latin America where\ndrug-fuelled murder rates are among the world's highest.\nAfter decades of heavy-handed police tactics in cities in\nBrazil, Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela and parts of Central\nAmerica, new methods of tackling crime are gaining currency,\nwith a stronger focus on social development projects.\nIn Colombia's second city of Medellin, this approach has\nfocused on urban renewal in slums: once-neglected shanty\ndistricts now boast landscaped parks, open-air gyms, schools,\nplaygrounds and community halls where youth orchestras play.\n\"Sustained investment in deprived areas ... combined with\nincreased community policing and recreational alternatives, like\nafter-school programmes, have seemed to turn the dial in\nreducing homicide rates,\" said Robert Muggah, co-founder of the\nIgarape Institute, a Brazil-based think-tank.\nAfter the death of cocaine drug-lord Pablo Escobar in 1993,\nMedellin's murder rate plunged more than 90% from 266 per\n100,000 people in 1991 to 19 per 100,000 in 2018.\nMedellin resident Johan Rodriguez, 25, decided to retire\nfrom gang life after taking part in a six-month programme to\nkeep vulnerable people away from crime.\nThe \"Parceros\" (\"Mates\") project, launched last year by city\nhall, helps teenagers go back to school, get job interviews and\nset up small businesses, from textiles to DJing.\n\"While the violence is always there, the project showed me\nthere's something else around the corner, another way,\" said\nRodriguez, who now works in a motorbike factory after social\nworkers sent out his CV to employers across the city.\n\nCLIMATE HAVENS\nYet as record numbers of people move into cities, some urban\nareas are facing uncertainty over the future as climate change\nbrings worsening threats, from extreme heat to flooding.\nOne fifth of the world's major cities will experience\nunprecedented climate conditions by 2050, such as more intense\ndry and monsoon seasons, according to the Crowther Lab, a\nSwiss-based research group.\nResearchers predict that as wild weather becomes more\nfrequent, it could force millions of people to move out of\nharm's way, with some unable to return.\nFrom Indonesia's sinking capital of Jakarta to the Middle\nEast's sweltering cities, that poses a new kind of challenge for\nurban planners, Rode said.\n\"Cities have faced numerous events like wars or earthquakes\nwhen populations had to be evacuated, but the idea had always\nbeen to return and rebuild,\" he said.\nIn response to the threats, some U.S. cities - such as\nMinnesota's Duluth - are studying efforts to become top\ndestinations for Americans abandoning parts of the country that\nmay one day be made inhospitable by climate change.\nAngel Dobrow, 59, who works for a small firm that supports\nfarmers, and her husband have already made the move to lakefront\nDuluth, leaving their longtime home in another part of Minnesota\nin 2017.\n\"As a person concerned with climate change, being near\nfreshwater and having a little bit of land to grow food and grow\nherbs was critical for me,\" said Dobrow, sitting in her lush\ngarden in the northern city.\nDuluth, located by the world's largest freshwater lake, may\nnot seem the most obvious choice as a haven for climate\nmigrants.\nWith its frigid winters, the metropolis is often ranked as\none of the coldest cities in the United States.\nBut Sandy Hoff, the president and owner of local real estate\ndevelopment firm F.I. Salter, said a changing climate could spur\na property boom that would \"no doubt\" propel his company in ways\nunseen since his grandfather acquired it 90 years ago.\nDobrow said when summer heat and humidity burden other areas\nof Minnesota, Duluth's lakefront breezes \"feel like air\nconditioning\".\nBut some fear an influx of new residents could exacerbate a\nhousing crisis in a city where few new homes have been built.\nJoel Kilgour, who chairs Duluth's Affordable Housing\nCoalition and volunteers at housing non-profit Loaves and\nFishes, said the city's homeless are forced to seek rooms at the\ncharity as they cannot afford rising rents.\n\"If we as a community can't solve that, there's no way that\nwe're going to be able to handle an influx of climate refugees\nin an equitable manner,\" Kilgour said.\nPotential climate refuge cities may also struggle to build\ncostly infrastructure, such as water treatment plants and energy\nutilities, without a sufficient tax base ahead of time to pay\nfor them, researchers warned.\n\nSMART CITIES?\nTo try to thrive amid rapid urbanisation and worsening\nclimate change threats, many cities around the world are trying\nto become \"smarter\".\nFrom heated bike paths to melt snow in Toronto to high-tech\nsensors that detect when Barcelona's bins need emptying,\ngovernments are pooling resources from citizens and businesses\nto make cities more efficient, sustainable and livable.\nMany of those efforts focus on improving mobility in cities,\nwith urban planners looking at innovative ways to cut both\ntraffic and climate-warming emissions.\nDubai - which, according to the Roads and Transport\nAuthority (RTA), has more than one vehicle for every two people\n- is experimenting with driverless mobility pods that aim to\ncombine the comfort of ride-hailing services like Uber with the\nefficiency and capacity of buses.\nThe cube-shaped vehicles, built by U.S.-based NEXT Future\nTransportation Inc., can carry up to 10 people each and dock\ntogether when in motion, allowing passengers to move from one\nunit to the other using the front and rear doors.\nThe vehicles \u2013 which should enter mass production at the end\nof 2020 \u2013 are designed to pick up single users at home, then\npool people going in the same direction inside one module, as\nother pods are released to collect more passengers.\n\"It's like a relay race,\" said founder Tommaso Gecchelin.\nRode of LSE Cities said it was important one inefficient car\nsystem should not be replaced with another, adding autonomous\nvehicles should carry as many passengers as possible.\nAllowing private self-driving cars could result in empty\nvehicles \"just driving around waiting for their owners\", taking\nup public space needlessly, he warned.\nOther major smart city initiatives have run into delays or\nunexpected problems, sparking criticism.\nKenya's planned Konza Technopolis \u2013 a new $14.5 billion city\nto be built about 60 km (37 miles) southeast of crowded Nairobi\n\u2013 has fallen behind schedule on its goal of accommodating 20,000\npeople by 2020, according to Nairobi-based entrepreneurs and\nanalysts.\nDubbed the Silicon Savannah, Konza aims to become a modern\ntech hub but the first building has yet to be completed due to\nred tape and a lack of funding, critics noted.\nLavasa - the first city in India's $7.5 billion plan to turn\n100 urban centres into Smart Cities by 2020 - has suffered from\ndesign issues, and ignored the needs of poor and marginalised\ngroups, planners and rights groups have said.\n\"Urban planners, not cities, are the ones who need to get\nsmarter,\" said Mills of Future Cities Catapult, calling for more\ninvestment in data collection and training of city planners.\n\"Google knows more about our cities than planning\ndepartments do.\"\n\nSLOWER CITIES?\nEven as some cities become smarter and more efficient, calls\nalso are mounting to slow the frantic pace of urban life.\nEfforts range from the literal \u2013 with many cities pushing\nfor lower speed limits on their roads \u2014 to the imaginative,\nincluding art installations to promote mindfulness.\nOn a recent \"sound walk\" in the English town of Reading, a\ndozen residents, including a retired historian and teenage\nstudents, strolled silently through parks, graveyards and\nbookstores.\nLed by sound artist Richard Bentley, the group uploaded\nphotos and audio recordings from their phones to Hush City, an\napp that maps quiet areas in cities.\nWith noise pollution the most common cause of environmental\ncomplaints in Europe, according to the European Commission, and\nmore people crowding into urban areas, Bentley expects peace and\nquiet could become a \"commodified luxury\".\nHistorically, poorer groups lower down the social ladder\nhave had to live in noisy parts of cities while those with more\nmeans could move away, he said.\n\"It's incredibly important to keep these quiet spaces and to\nbe aware of their possible disappearance,\" he added.\nSome places are jumping on the livability bandwagon through\nCittaslow, which means \"slow city\" in Italian.\nThe global network of more than 260 cities grades its\nmembers according to factors such as sustainable infrastructure,\npromotion of local economies, fairness and \"good living\".\nSouth Korean member Jeonju, a city of about 650,000 people,\nhas planted millions of trees and runs monthly car-free zones\nsince joining in 2016, Mayor Seung-Su Kim said by email.\nPier Giorgio Oliveti, the network's secretary general, said\nthe approach could be a \"vaccine\" for the ills of modernity.\nBut Mills of Future Cities Catapult argued that \"one of the\nmost exciting things about cities is how alive they are\".\n\"I don't think we should be slowing them down,\" he added.\nNow, more than ever, urban planners and government should\n\"reflect on what cities are for\", advised LSE Cities' Rode.\n\"Why are cities such attractive places for living and\nworking? Because they bring people together to enjoy public\nlife,\" he said.\n\"That real, physical experience needs to be preserved.\"\n(Reporting by Zoe Tabary, Adela Suliman and Amber Milne in\nLondon, Umberto Bacchi in Dubai, Carey L.

        "text": "By Umberto Bacchi\nCOPENHAGEN, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From\nelectric buses to pollution-sucking urban gardens, cities around\nthe world are experimenting with ways to ensure global climate\ngoals are met, as they account for about three-quarters of\nplanet-warming emissions, according to the United Nations.\nHere are seven award-winning initiatives to make cities\ngreener, announced by the C40 network of cities tackling climate\nchange on Thursday:\n\n1. MEDELLIN, Colombia - Colombia's second city has invested\nmore\nthan $16 million to plant almost 9,000 trees to form 30 \"green\ncorridors\" across the city since 2016. Besides capturing\npollution, the plants have helped reduce average temperatures in\nthe city by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) and increased\nbiodiversity, providing friendly habitats for animals.\n2. ACCRA, Ghana - Since 2016, Accra has been working with\nmore than\n600 informal refuse collectors, who used to dump rubbish that\nwas burned at illegal open-air sites, causing pollution. More\nwaste is now being collected, recycled and disposed of safely.\n3. KOLKATA, India - Kolkata is planning to have its entire\n5,000-strong bus fleet, as well as ferries crossing the Ganges\nRiver, run on electricity by 2030. It has bought 80 electric\nbuses and plans to add another 100 next year.\n4. LONDON, United Kingdom - London introduced the world's\nfirst\nUltra Low Emission Zone in 2019, requiring all vehicles passing\nthrough the city centre to meet strict emissions standards or\npay a fee. Within months, the number of more polluting vehicles\nfell by a third as people were pushed to walk, cycle or use\npublic transport.\n5. SAN FRANCISCO, United States - San Francisco's\nCleanPowerSF\nprogramme allows residents to get their electricity completely\nor in large part from renewable sources at competitive rates.\nThe city hopes this will help it achieve a goal of reducing\ngreenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2025.\n6. GUANGZHOU, China - Since 2017, Guangzhou has invested\n$2.1\nbillion to convert its entire fleet of 11,220 buses to run on\nelectricity and installed some 4,000 charging stations to power\nthem. This has reduced air pollution and noise as well as the\ncity's transport system operational costs.\n7. SEOUL, South Korea - Seoul has subsidised the\ninstallation of\nsolar panels on balconies and rooftops of 1 million homes since\n2017, as well as city buildings like schools and parking lots.\nThe city hopes to produce up to 1 GW of solar energy - equal to\nthat generated by a nuclear reactor - by 2022.\nSources: C40, Transport for London, Thomson Reuters\nFoundation\n(Reporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Katy\nMigiro.

        "text": "(Reworks and updates with Cate Blanchett quotes)\nBy Emma Batha\nLONDON, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Film star Cate\nBlanchett called on Monday for the world to end the\n\"devastating\" plight of millions of people with no nationality\namid warnings that rising xenophobia is stymieing efforts to\nmeet a 2024 deadline for eradicating statelessness.\nThe double Oscar-winner said statelessness prevented people\nfulfilling their potential, and was a \"heartbreaking\" waste of\nhuman talent.\nBlanchett threw her weight behind the global #Ibelong\ncampaign to end statelessness as she addressed an\nintergovernmental meeting in Geneva aimed at dramatically\nescalating progress.\nHer support will boost attention on an issue that has long\nbeen neglected.\nNot recognised as nationals of any country, stateless people\nare often deprived of basic rights like education and\nhealthcare, and risk exploitation and detention.\nBlanchett held up her own passport, credit card and Medicare\ncard as she urged ministers and government officials to imagine\nhow difficult life would be if they had no documents.\n\"It's a condition of invisibility,\" she said. \"Stateless\npeople are unseen and unheard.\"\nBlanchett, a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. refugee agency\n(UNHCR), interviewed Maha Mamo, a formerly stateless activist\nwho has become a torchbearer for #Ibelong, describing her as an\n\"extraordinary beacon of hope\".\nThe activist, who speaks five languages, told delegates how\nher hopes of studying medicine and joining a Lebanese basketball\nteam were crushed because she had no papers.\nThe Geneva meeting comes halfway through the #Ibelong\ninitiative launched in 2014.\nBut the task ahead is monumental. Only about 200,000 people\nacquired citizenship during the first half of the campaign,\nbarely making a dent in the overall number.\nAnd U.N. officials admit the total may now be even higher\nthan in 2014 because of increasing displacement triggered by\ncrises in Syria, Venezuela and elsewhere, which has raised the\nrisk of many children growing up stateless.\nThere is also no solution in sight for many of the largest\ngroups of stateless people including the Rohingya, hundreds of\nthousands of whom have fled to Bangladesh following an upsurge\nin violence.\nU.N. officials are also keeping a close eye on India, where\n1.9 million people in the northeastern state of Assam have been\nleft off a register of citizens, stoking concerns that many\ncould become stateless.\nUNHCR chief Filippo Grandi said global awareness of the\nrepercussions of statelessness was growing and they had received\nmore than 170 pledges of action ahead of the meeting.\nBut he warned that \"damaging forms of nationalism\" and the\n\"manipulation of anti-refugee and migrant sentiment\" were\nputting progress at risk.\nDOGS HAVE MORE RIGHTS\nPeople end up stateless for a host of reasons including\nmigration, flawed citizenship laws and ethnic discrimination.\nOthers fall through the cracks when countries break up.\nAside from Myanmar, there are big stateless groups in Ivory\nCoast, Thailand, Nepal, Kuwait and some former Soviet countries.\nStateless people have previously told the Thomson Reuters\nFoundation that they feel stigmatised and forgotten.\n\"We've had people telling us, 'dogs are more important than\nI am',\" said Melanie Khanna, head of the UNHCR's statelessness\nsection.\n\"People feel totally scarred and isolated. They often say,\n'I thought it was just me'. It sends chills down your spine.\"\nAlmost all countries are represented at the Geneva meeting,\nwith some 1,000 delegates including a number of ministers. U.N.\nofficials say the pledges will provide a roadmap for\naccelerating the campaign.\nIn July, Kyrgyzstan made history when it became the first\ncountry to officially end statelessness. U.N. officials believe\nTurkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan could also meet the\n2024 deadline.\nThailand, where nearly 479,000 people are stateless,\nincluding members of ethnic hill tribes in the northern border\nregions, is also stepping up action.\nThe issue made international headlines last year during\nrescue efforts to save a young Thai football team trapped in a\nflooded cave.\nDuring the drama it emerged that several of the boys and\ntheir coach were stateless. They were granted citizenship after\ntheir ordeal.\n\nWIN-WIN\nBut resolving statelessness is not just a human rights\nissue. Statelessness has fuelled conflict and displacement in\nboth Myanmar and Ivory Coast.\nKhanna said there was a growing recognition that resolving\nstatelessness was a \"win-win\" because it was in governments'\ninterests to have everybody feel invested in the society they\nlived in and motivated to contribute.\nThe U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of\nglobal pledges on tackling poverty, inequality and other ills\nwith an overall ambition to \"to leave no one behind\", have\nhelped shift attitudes, Khanna said.\n\"The SDGs have allowed us to talk about this whole area as a\ndevelopment issue and not just a human rights one,\" she added.\n\"This makes a lot of sense because you don't want\ndisenfranchised, impoverished people on your territory.\"\nKhanna said an increasing number of countries were changing\ntheir nationality laws and policies to prevent future\ngenerations ending up in limbo.\nColombia, for example, has announced it will give\ncitizenship to thousands of children born to Venezuelan migrants\nto prevent them growing up stateless.\nOther countries have scrapped discriminatory laws that\nprevent women passing their citizenship to their children - a\nmajor cause of statelessness.\nThe impact of such laws has been clearly seen during the\nSyrian war with many displaced mothers unable to obtain\ndocuments for their children where the father is dead or absent.\nIran became the latest country to pass reforms last week.\nThere has also been a flurry of countries joining the U.N.\nconventions on protecting stateless people and preventing\nstatelessness.\nThe 1961 convention stipulates that a state must grant\nnationality to anyone born on its territory who would otherwise\nbe stateless - a safeguard that would wipe out most new cases of\nstatelessness if adopted by all countries.\nBlanchett appealed to all nations to give stateless people\n\"their basic human right to belong\", adding that solutions were\noften straightforward.\n\"It is a man-made problem and it is solvable,\" she said.\n(Reporting by Emma Batha @emmabatha; Editing by Claire Cozens.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

        "text": "By Emma Batha\nLONDON, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - An estimated 10\nto 15 million people are not recognised as nationals by any\ncountry, often depriving them of basic rights most of the world\ntakes for granted such as education, healthcare, housing and\njobs.\nThe U.N. refugee agency is hosting a major intergovernmental\nmeeting in Geneva on Monday to assess progress at the midpoint\nof its #Ibelong campaign which aims to end statelessness by\n2024. Here are examples of stateless populations:\n\nMYANMAR/BANGLADESH: In 1982, Buddhist-majority Myanmar\npassed a citizenship law that effectively rendered stateless\nmost Rohingya, who are Muslim and of South Asian descent.\nEthnic violence has driven many to leave, but hundreds of\nthousands remain in Myanmar. There are about 900,000 Rohingya in\nneighbouring Bangladesh and smaller populations across Asia.\nSome are sold into slavery on fishing boats and plantations.\n\nIVORY COAST: Ivory Coast is home to 692,000 stateless\npeople. Many are descended from migrants from neighbouring\ncountries who were encouraged to work on Ivory Coast's coffee\nand cotton plantations in the 20th century.\nAt least a quarter of Ivory Coast's population is estimated\nto be of foreign descent, and the question of who is or is not\nIvorian helped fuel two civil wars in the West African country.\n\nTHAILAND: Nearly 479,000 people are stateless, including\nmembers of ethnic hill tribes such as the Yao, Hmong and Karen\nwho live in the mountainous border with Myanmar and Laos, and\nthe semi-nomadic \"Sea Gypsies\" along the Andaman coast.\n\nESTONIA/LATVIA: When the Soviet Union broke up, many ethnic\nRussians remained in the new Baltic states and were defined as\n\"non-citizens\".\nNearly 221,000 stateless people live in Latvia and 78,000 in\nEstonia, mainly ethnic Russians who have trouble obtaining\ncitizenship and at times face discrimination.\n\nSYRIA: In 1962, many Kurds in the northeast were stripped of\ncitizenship, a move Human Rights Watch described as part of a\nplan to \"Arabise\" the resource-rich region.\nBefore the civil war, there were an estimated 300,000\nstateless Kurds in Syria, many of whom were promised nationality\nby President Bashar al-Assad in reaction to the 2011 uprising.\nU.N. data suggests the number fell to 160,000, but this may\nbe partly because many fled the war.\nHuman rights experts have warned that babies born to Syrian\nrefugee women in Lebanon and Jordan could end up stateless.\n\nKUWAIT: Stateless people are known as Bidoon, which is short\nfor bidoon jinsiya meaning \"without nationality\" in Arabic. Some\ntrace their origins to nomadic tribes that once moved freely\naround the Gulf region.\nThere are about 92,000 Bidoon in Kuwait, according to U.N.\ndata, but some estimates are much higher. They are often barred\nfrom free education, healthcare and many jobs.\n\nNEPAL: Although Nepal says it does not have a stateless\npopulation, experts on statelessness believe many people,\npossibly hundreds of thousands, may be affected.\nPart of the problem derives from a law banning women married\nto foreigners from passing their nationality to their children.\nThere is also a stateless population of people who were expelled\nby Bhutan in the 1990s.\n\nDOMINICAN REPUBLIC: A 2013 court ruling, along with earlier\nchanges to nationality laws aimed at tackling illegal migration,\nhas left many stateless, mostly people of Haitian descent who\nwere born in Dominican Republic.\nIn 2015, there were about 134,000 stateless people,\naccording to U.N. data, but the figures are being updated.\n\nIRAQ: There are about 47,500 stateless people who include\nBidoon and Faili Kurds, an ethnic group that historically live\nboth sides of the Iraq-Iran border.\nMore than 100,000 Faili Kurds had their nationality revoked\nin 1980 under the Ba'ath regime. Although many have since had\ntheir nationality reinstated, others remain stateless.\n\nEUROPE: Tens of thousands of stateless Roma - an ethnic\ngroup with origins in India - are thought to live in central,\neastern and southern Europe. With the break-up of Czechoslovakia\nand Yugoslavia, successor states claimed they belonged\nelsewhere.\nOther Roma in Kosovo and Bosnia have become stateless due to\nwar-time displacement.\nRoma are often unable to register their children's births or\nhold official property titles. This can make it hard to prove\nwhere they are from.\n\nVENEZUELA: Some children born to Venezuelan parents who have\nfled to other countries amid a political and economic crisis at\nhome are at increased risk of statelessness.\n(Reporting by Emma Batha @emmabatha, Editing by Claire Cozens.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

        "text": "By Emma Batha\nLONDON, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Film star Cate\nBlanchett will back a global campaign on Monday to end the\nplight of an estimated 10 million people with no nationality\namid warnings rising xenophobia is stymieing efforts to meet a\n2024 deadline for eradicating statelessness.\nThe double Oscar-winner will speak at a major meeting in\nGeneva aimed at persuading governments to dramatically escalate\nprogress in the campaign called #Ibelong.\nBlanchett's attendance will help boost attention on some of\nthe world's most invisible people.\nNot recognised as nationals of any country, stateless people\nare often deprived of basic rights like education and\nhealthcare, and risk exploitation and detention.\nBlanchett will interview Maha Mamo, a formerly stateless\nactivist who has become a torchbearer for #Ibelong.\nAs a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR),\nBlanchett recently visited Bangladesh to meet stateless Rohingya\nwho have fled Myanmar, and has met displaced Syrian families in\nthe Middle East.\nWhen U.N. chief Antonio Guterres launched the #Ibelong\ninitiative in 2014, during his time as head of the UNHCR, he\ndescribed statelessness as a \"cancer\" that must be excised.\nBut the task ahead is monumental. Only about 200,000 people\nacquired citizenship during the first half of the campaign,\nbarely making a dent in the overall number.\nAnd U.N. officials admit the total may now be even higher\nthan in 2014 because of increasing displacement triggered by\ncrises in Syria, Venezuela and elsewhere, which has raised the\nrisk of many children growing up stateless.\nThere is also no solution in sight for many of the largest\ngroups of stateless people including the Rohingya, hundreds of\nthousands of whom have fled to Bangladesh following an upsurge\nin violence.\nExperts on statelessness spoke of \"storm clouds on the\nhorizon\" as forced displacement, xenophobia and populism\ncomplicate efforts to meet the 2024 deadline.\nThey are keeping a close eye on India, where 1.9 million\npeople in the northeastern state of Assam have been left off a\nregister of citizens, stoking concerns that many could become\nstateless.\nDOGS HAVE MORE RIGHTS\nPeople end up stateless for a host of historical, social and\nlegal reasons including migration, flawed citizenship laws and\nethnic discrimination. Others fall through the cracks when\ncountries break up.\nAside from Myanmar, there are big stateless groups in Ivory\nCoast, Thailand, Nepal, Kuwait and some former Soviet countries.\nStateless people have previously told the Thomson Reuters\nFoundation that they feel stigmatised and forgotten.\n\"We've had people telling us, 'dogs are more important than\nI am',\" said Melanie Khanna, head of the UNHCR's statelessness\nsection.\n\"People feel totally scarred and isolated. They often say,\n'I thought it was just me'. It sends chills down your spine.\"\nDespite slow progress on reducing numbers, Khanna said there\nwas far greater global awareness of statelessness than five\nyears ago.\nAlmost all countries will be represented in Geneva, with\nmore than 20 sending ministers. U.N. officials expect\ngovernments to make scores of pledges which will provide a\nroadmap for accelerating the campaign.\nIn July, Kyrgyzstan made history when it became the first\ncountry to officially end statelessness. U.N. officials believe\nTurkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan could also meet the\n2024 deadline.\nThailand, where nearly 479,000 people are stateless,\nincluding members of ethnic hill tribes in the northern border\nregions, is also stepping up action.\nThe issue made international headlines last year during\nrescue efforts to save a young Thai football team trapped in a\nflooded cave.\nDuring the drama it emerged that several of the boys and\ntheir coach were stateless. They were granted citizenship after\ntheir ordeal.\n\nWIN-WIN\nBut resolving statelessness is not just a human rights\nissue. Statelessness has fuelled conflict and displacement in\nboth Myanmar and Ivory Coast.\nKhanna said there was a growing recognition that resolving\nstatelessness was a \"win-win\" because it was in governments'\ninterests to have everybody feel invested in the society they\nlive in and motivated to contribute.\nThe U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of\nglobal pledges on tackling poverty, inequality and other ills\nwith an overall ambition to \"to leave no one behind\", have\nhelped shift attitudes, Khanna said.\n\"The SDGs have allowed us to talk about this whole area as a\ndevelopment issue and not just a human rights one,\" she added.\n\"This makes a lot of sense because you don't want\ndisenfranchised, impoverished people on your territory.\"\nKhanna said an increasing number of countries were changing\ntheir nationality laws and policies to prevent future\ngenerations ending up in limbo.\nColombia, for example, has announced it will give\ncitizenship to thousands of children born to Venezuelan migrants\nto prevent them growing up stateless.\nOther countries have scrapped discriminatory laws that\nprevent women passing their citizenship to their children - a\nmajor cause of statelessness.\nThe impact of such laws has been clearly seen during the\nSyrian war with many displaced mothers unable to obtain\ndocuments for their children where the father is dead or absent.\nIran became the latest country to pass reforms last week - a\nmove human rights experts believe could help thousands of\nchildren obtain citizenship.\nThere has also been a flurry of countries joining the U.N.\nconventions on preventing and eliminating statelessness.\nThe 1961 convention stipulates that a state must grant\nnationality to anyone born on its territory who would otherwise\nbe stateless - a safeguard that would wipe-out most new cases of\nstatelessness if adopted by all countries.\n\"Statelessness causes devastating and totally unnecessary\ndamage,\" Khanna said.\n\"But solutions aren't complicated. The biggest obstacle is\npolitical will.\"\n(Reporting by Emma Batha @emmabatha; Editing by Claire Cozens.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

        "text": "By Sonia Elks\nLONDON, Oct 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Women's rights\ncampaigners on Tuesday marked two years since the #MeToo\ncampaign against sexual harassment first swept through social\nmedia.\nThe global movement has brought down multiple high-profile\nfigures and sparked wider debates over women's safety, workplace\nrepresentation and sexism.\nHere's how #MeToo grew from a grassroots campaign to a\nglobal touchpoint:\n2006: Activist Tarana Burke creates the \"Me Too\" movement to\nhelp sexual assault victims in underprivileged communities in\nthe United States.\nOct. 5-8, 2017: Hollywood film mogul Harvey Weinstein is\nfired from his production company after being accused of\nsexually harassment. Scores of women have since accused him of\nsexual misconduct dating back decades, allegations he denies.\nWeinstein faces trial for rape in January 2020.\nOct. 15, 2017: Actor Alyssa Milano urges anyone who has been\nsexually assaulted to write \"Me too\" on Twitter, in a post that\nprompts a flood of women to share their stories and is hailed as\nthe start of the mass #MeToo movement.\nOct. 2017: The movement goes international, with France\nseeing a similar online campaign under the hashtag\n#BalanceTonPorc.\nDec. 6, 2017: Time magazine names the \"silence breakers\" who\nhave spoken out about sexual harassment and assault, as its\nPerson of the Year.\nJan. 1, 2018: Hollywood stars help launch a #TimesUp\ncampaign against sexual harassment.

        "text": "By Anastasia Moloney\nBOGOTA, Oct 8 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Drug\ntrafficking and organised crime are fuelling deforestation in\nprotected tropical forests and national parks across Central\nAmerica, causing substantial economic losses, researchers said\non Tuesday.\nTraffickers are cutting down trees to build roads and\nairstrips to transport cocaine and are encroaching ever further\ninto more remote forest areas to evade anti-narcotics\noperations, according to two separate studies on the problem.\n\"Narco-deforestation now affects large tropical forests in\nGuatemala, Honduras (and) Nicaragua, and is beginning to affect\nCosta Rica as well,\" Jennifer A. Devine, assistant geography\nprofessor at Texas State University and co-author of the\nstudies, said in a statement.\nProtected mangrove and wetland areas in coastal parts of\nHonduras and Costa Rica are \"attractive for supplying maritime\nroutes and warehousing cocaine\", researchers wrote.\nEnvironmental degradation caused by drug trafficking leads\nto losses of about $215 million annually in natural and cultural\nresources across Central America's protected forest areas,\nshowed estimates by report co-author Bernardo Aguilar-Gonzalez.\n\"That is more than double the conservation budget the\nregion's governments allocate to the forest areas,\" noted\nAguilar-Gonzalez, who heads Fundacion Neotropica, a Costa Rican\nnonprofit that promotes community management of natural\nresources.\nEnsuring forest communities have secure land tenure,\nincluding collective land titles, and allowing them to decide\nhow their land should be managed could help deter trafficking\nand slow deforestation, researchers said.\nAreas that are managed by communities record \"very low\nforest losses\", they added.\n\"Investing in community land rights and participatory\ngovernance in protected areas is a key strategy to combat drug\ntrafficking and climate change simultaneously,\" Aguilar-Gonzalez\nsaid in a statement.\nForest protection has come under the spotlight as a low-cost\nway to keep climate change in check because trees store\nplanet-warming carbon. They release it when they are burned or\nrot.\nDeforestation rates have risen in the world's tropical\nregions, while Latin American countries have also been\nstruggling to curb forest fires in the Amazon this year.\nThe forest research was presented at a meeting in Costa Rica\nthis week to examine progress on the 2015 Paris Agreement to\ntackle climate change, including commitments to cut greenhouse\ngas emissions, ahead of December's U.N. climate talks in Chile.\n(Reporting by Anastasia Moloney @anastasiabogota, Editing by\nMegan Rowling.

At the end of the\nshow, he changes his perspective.\nThe play is part of a $7-million project funded by the World\nFood Programme (WFP) and managed by the Egyptian Ministry of\nAgriculture that aims to help farmers in the region cope better\nwith climate change threats through modern technology,\nsustainable growing techniques and better understanding of\nclimate issues.\nOrganisers say the project, which started in 2013 and is\nscheduled to end early next year, has boosted the production of\nsome major crops by at least a third and drastically cut water\nconsumption on the farms involved.\nIt is one in a series of efforts the Egyptian government has\nmade over the past decade to limit the negative impact of\nclimate change on farmers across the country.\n\"Community mobilisation on the issue of climate change can\nencourage many people to embrace the ideas of the project. And\ntheatre is one of the methods to mobilise the community,\" said\nAyam Abu el-Hagag, an actor in the traveling troupe and also an\nagricultural advisor.\nHe noted that each time the troupe delivers a joke on stage,\nthe characters explain the information to make it accessible to\nall farmers, even those with little or no formal education.\n\"Comedy helps people understand things easier,\" he added.\n\nHIGHLY VULNERABLE\nClimate change has been a major challenge for Egypt and\naccording to the WFP, \"southern Egypt is one of the areas most\nvulnerable to climate change within the region\".\nEnvironmental groups regard Egypt as one of the countries\nmost threatened by the negative effects of climate change, which\ninclude sea-level rise, water poverty, and deteriorating public\nhealth and ecosystems.\nThe WFP forecasts that Upper Egypt could lose up to 30% of\nits food production by 2050 as climate change brings more\nextreme weather and other threats.\nSaber Osman, director of the climate change adaptation\ndepartment at Egypt's Ministry of Environment, told the Thomson\nReuters Foundation that losses could lead to a major crisis for\nEgypt's farming sector.\nAgriculture represents almost 15% of the country's gross\ndomestic product and employs about a third of the workforce, he\nsaid.\nThe idea behind the WFP project is to get farmers involved\nin the frontline fight against climate change and stamp out bad\nfarming habits, said the project's director, Othman el-Sheikh.\nThat includes encouraging farmers to plant crop varieties\nthat require less water and to follow new irrigation methods to\nreduce water consumption.\nFarmers also learn how to combine traditional farming\ntechniques with more modern technology, such as solar-powered\nirrigation pumps and an app that alerts farmers to incoming\nweather events.\nOne main focus for the project is to help farmers work\ntogether, to cut the cost of seeds by buying them in bulk and\nplanting them across several neighbouring farms, el-Sheikh\nexplained.\n\"Fragmented agricultural holdings are common throughout\nEgypt in general and in Upper Egypt in particular,\" he said.\nWhen they work independently, many farmers cannot afford to\naccess high-quality resources, which lowers their productivity\nand leads to about 10% of land lying fallow, he added.\nThe initiative helps farmers organise into groups of at\nleast 70, who agree to pool their resources.\nEvery planting season, the Society Development Association\nin Sahel Selim, which is working with the WFP on the project,\nbuys enough seed for all 70 farmers and divides the seeds\nequally among them.\nThe farmers carry out the sowing and eventual harvesting\ntogether, cutting costs by sharing equipment and manpower,\nel-Sheikh explained.\nThe hope is that once the project ends, the farmer groups\nwill be making enough revenue to allow them to buy high-quality\nseeds for themselves, he said.\nEl-Sheikh added that almost 2,000 farms have been\nconsolidated into larger farming groups through the project in\nthe past three years.\n\nFINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE\nThe WFP project also runs a loan program that provides\nvillagers with goats and ducks to give them an alternative\nsource of income in case their crops fail.\nSabrine Haridi, a 33-year-old mother of four children in\nSahel Selim, said she got a loan to acquire 38 ducks, which\nallow her to cover the family's expenses, even in seasons when\nher husband's wheat harvest falls short.\nShe sells some of the ducks for their meat and rears more\nfrom eggs, selling them when they mature. Any profit she makes\ngoes toward paying off the loan.\n\"Two years ago, I was desperate because my husband could not\nafford our daily needs. I am now financially independent,\" she\ntold the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\"When my husband fails to get the expected money from his\ncrop due to climate change, I pay for whatever we need,\nincluding food, clothes and school expenses,\" she added.\n\n'IN GOD'S HANDS'\nSince the project was launched in Egypt in 2013, half a\nmillion farmers have become involved, said el-Sheikh\nHe told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that applying the new\nmethods has increased wheat production by 30% to 40%, boosted\nsugarcane output by about 30% and reduced water consumption by a\nthird.\nBut getting to that point was not easy, said Osman at the\nenvironment ministry.\n\"Community resistance to adopting methods for coping with\nclimate change is common in Egyptian villages,\" he said, adding\nthat some farmers do not see climate change as an issue that can\nbe addressed because it is \"in God's hands\".\nEl-Sheikh said that some farmers used to ask him, \"What\nwould you do to combat climate change? Would you change God's\nweather?\"\nHe told them the efforts only aimed to help farmers cope\nwith changing weather, not shift the weather itself.\n\"Convincing farmers to use modern technology and advanced\nagricultural means, as well as encouraging women to take part in\nthe project, are some of the biggest challenges we face,\" El\nSheikh added.\nHassan Bekheet, 53, said he didn't need much convincing to\nswap his maize crops for drought-tolerant sorghum when he joined\nthe project in Sahel Selim.\nOnce he made the switch, his crop yield increased by about\n25%, as did his revenues, he said, while his costs went down by\n15%.\nHe was so happy with what he learned from the project that he\ngot together with other participants to pass those lessons on to\nneighbours.\n\"We are all in the same boat and we should fight these\nchanges together,\" Bekheet said.\n(Reporting by Menna A.

        "text": "By Adaobi Nwaubani and Sarah Shearman\nABUJA/LONDON, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When\nOlamide Ayeni-Babajide discovered an expensive ornament she\npurchased on a trip abroad was made of old corn husk it opened\nher eyes to the potential of Nigeria's own waste problem.\nIn 2016 she founded Pearl Recycling, which remodels solid\nwaste such as old tyres into furniture in Lagos, Africa's most\npopulous city with 21 million people and home to one of the\nworld's largest garbage sites.\nThe social enterprise \u2013 a business that aims to do good \u2013 is\nalso looking to tackle Nigeria's youth unemployment problem,\ntraining hundreds of young locals to recycle disused materials,\nwith most them going on to set up their own waste ventures.\n\"Nigeria is a good place for social entrepreneurs because\nthere are diverse problems to be solved,\" said Ayeni-Babajide.\nThe Thomson Reuters Foundation's second global poll on the\nbest country to be a social entrepreneur found the three African\nnations among the world's 45 biggest economies surveyed -\nNigeria, Egypt and South Africa - failed to make the top 20.\nBut Nigeria came sixth when about 900 social enterprise\nexperts were asked where young people are playing a key role in\nthe growing sector. Egypt came fourth and South Africa 34th in\nthe youth ranking in the poll, supported by Deutsche Bank.\nIn Nigeria - a young country where the median age is about\n18 - young people are rising to find business solutions to\nchallenges ranging from poverty to environmental and cultural\nissues \u2013 from illiteracy to pollution \u2013 neglected by the\ngovernment.\nFacing a youth unemployment crisis \u2013 with more than half of\n15-35 year olds out of work or not in full-time jobs \u2013 a new\ngeneration of social entrepreneurs wants to create opportunities\nand economic prosperity themselves.\nPASSION AND ENERGY\nFemi Taiwo, executive director of LEAP Africa, said\nencouragement from faith-based organisations, motivational\nspeakers, an array of local and international programmes and\ncompetitions for young leaders has helped pave the way.\n\"These initiatives and many more put a spotlight on young\npeople making a change, and inspired many more to jump on the\nbandwagon,\" said Taiwo, whose Lagos-based youth leadership\nnon-profit provides free training for social innovators.\nBut with this zeal for social entrepreneurship comes risks.\n\"The enthusiasm, the energy, the drive of young people is\nincomparable,\" said Atinuke Lebile, 31, founder of Ibadan-based\nsocial enterprise Cato Foods.\n\"However, young people often lack experience and the\npatience to learn,\" added Lebile, whose biotechnology business\naims to reduce malnutrition and poverty by creating fortified\nfood products, such as custard enriched with vitamins A and C.\nIn addition to young people, women are increasingly well\nrepresented in leadership positions in social enterprises in\nNigeria, which jumped to joint ninth place on this issue from\n40th in the inaugural global poll in 2016.\nAyeni-Babajide, 36, who worked as an engineer in a\nmale-dominated sector for almost a decade before founding Pearl\nRecycling, finds Nigerians are gradually getting used to women\nin leadership positions.\n\"Women now know their rights and power they possess,\" she\nsaid, but added that women still found it hard to access funds.\n\"The majority of laid down rules are favouring men,\nespecially access to capital. Women need access to funds and an\nenabling environment devoid of gender profiling to thrive.\"\nLike Nigeria, in Egypt there has also been a concerted push\nto support young social entrepreneurs, especially since the\ncountry's 2011 uprising, said Iman Bibars of Ashoka Arab World,\na non-profit organisation that supports social entrepreneurs.\nEgypt, like Nigeria, has a large youth population with 34%\nof people under the age of 14 compared to 44% in Nigeria,\naccording to World Bank data from 2018.\n\"After the Arab Spring there was a lot of interest in the\nyouth, there were a lot of programmes by the government and\ninternational donors and CSR [corporate social responsibility]\nin trying to figure out how to support young people,\" she said.\nThis year Ashoka Arab World launched a Young Changemakers\nscheme with the British Council and social enterprise Red Ochre\nto help support females aged 16-20 from rural Egypt develop\nsocial enterprise ideas.\nEgypt rose to 22nd place from 29th three years ago when\nasked if women were well represented in social enterprises.\nSouth Africa was in 23rd place, also up from 29th.\n\"The reason why young people are excited is it gives them an\nopportunity to be leaders, it gives them an opportunity to be of\nhelp to others and recognition, and this is something that young\npeople did not have before,\" said Bibars.\n\"Since there are so many social problems in the country and\npoverty, there is a lot of space for them to innovate.\"\n(Reporting by Sarah Shearman @Shearmans.

        "text": "By Belinda Goldsmith\nADDIS ABABA, Oct 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The\nopening of Ethiopia's once-secretive imperial palace complex has\nbeen hailed as symbolising a new era of openness for the east\nAfrican nation, but it also has another aim - job creation.\nThe Menelik palace and its 40-acre Unity Park compound\noverlooking Addis Ababa opened to the public this month after\nbeing closed for more than a century when it housed emperors but\nwas also used as a torture site under the communist Derg regime.\nIt was established in 1887 by Emperor Menelik II and given\nback to the city by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who came to power\n18 months ago. The move \"symbolises our ability to come\ntogether\" while also boosting tourism and jobs, his office said.\nThe palace opening was cited at an annual gathering of\nsocial entrepreneurs in Addis Ababa as an example of a rising\nnumber of tourism businesses set up with a mission to help local\ncommunities - with warnings these projects came with risks.\n\"(The palace) will add value to our tourism ... it will help\nEthiopia,\" said Samrawit Moges, founder of Travel Ethiopia,\nfirst company in the country to use female guides.\n\"But tourism is a very delicate sector that can change the\ncountry for better or for worse ... we need to give high\nimportance to the environment.\"\nThe growing social enterprise sector is tapping into the\nglobal travel and tourism industry, which contributed a record\n$8.8 trillion and 319 million jobs to the world economy in 2018,\naccording to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC).\nThe WTTC forecast another 100 million new jobs by 2029.\n\nDANGERS OF GROWTH\nMatt Pfahlert, co-founder of the Australian Centre for Rural\nEntrepreneurship, said growing numbers of tourism projects from\nAustralia to Africa were being led by social enterprises -\nbusinesses set up with a mission to help society.\nThere was no official record on the number of such ventures.\nPfahlert led a A$2.5 million ($1.7 million) community\nbuy-back of an old jail in his home town of Beechworth in the\nAustralian state of Victoria, that was famed for its connection\nto the nation's legendary outlaw Ned Kelly.\nIt opened in 2017, creating 22 jobs in a rural area with few\nopportunities and was helping to raise funds to train young\npeople on business development to stem a decline in rural areas.\n\"For us the jail is the engine for a national project,\"\nPfahlert told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at the 12th annual\nSocial Enterprise World Forum (SEWF).\n\"If we get it right we can make a huge difference,\" said\nPfahlert, adding that cycling tours were another draw.\nHe said tourism social enterprises focused on helping\ncommunities, while traditional tourism businesses tended to be\nprofit-oriented with a focus on volume growth.\nIn Ireland, for example, the social enterprise My Streets\ntrains homeless people to run tours of Dublin and Drogheda.\nWhile in India, Grassroutes aims to create \"one million\nlivelihood opportunities\" and reduce rural migration by running\nvarious tourist activities in villages outside Mumbai.\nBut tourism social entrepreneurs said in the rush to do\ngood, it was important to be wary of not growing too fast as\nthis could negatively impact communities and the environment.\nTheodore Nzabonimpa, founder of Beyond The Gorilla\nExperiences in Rwanda, said it had been important to stem the\nnumber of tourists visiting the mountain gorillas in his country\nby doubling national park prices in 2017 before damage occurred.\n\"The risks can be huge even if the intention is good ... you\nhave to take quick action to address any risks,\" said\nNzabonimpa, whose tour company promotes community ecotourism.\n($1 = 1.4650 Australian dollars)\n(Reporting by Belinda Goldsmith @BeeGoldsmith; Editing by\nClaire Cozens.

        "text": "By Dagim Terefe\nADDIS ABABA, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Every\nday, Tewdros Belay turns on the tap in his home in the heart of\nEthiopia's capital and expects nothing to happen. The rare times\nwhen water does trickle from the spout, it is reason to\ncelebrate.\n\"Sometimes we do not get water for so many weeks - if we get\nwater, we welcome it by dancing,\" said Tewdros, 32, with a sad\nsmile.\nLike many of his neighbours in the Kirkos district of Addis\nAbaba, and like thousands of others living in the city, Tewdros\nhas struggled to secure a regular supply of clean water in his\nhome for at least 10 years.\nEthiopia is the source of up to 80% of the River Nile's\nwater. But getting enough potable water to everyone in the\ncountry who needs it is a challenge, water experts and officials\nsay.\nThe capital has long suffered with water shortages, the\nresult of an aging and limited water supply system, lack of\nwater storage and a rapidly growing population.\nEnvironmental experts warn that climate change will only\nmake matters worse in the future.\nHoping to ease the shortage, the Addis Ababa government has\nembarked on a series of development projects aimed at pumping\nstoring, cleaning and delivering more groundwater.\nThe latest, the Legedadi Phase II Water Project, launched in\nApril, aims to supply the city with an additional 86,000 cubic\nmetres of clean water per day.\nThat would help boost the area of the city receiving regular\nwater supply from 60% to 66%, according to Nigusse Desalegn,\nspokesman for the Addis Ababa Water and Sewerage Authority\n(AAWSA).\nThe government also plans to install additional groundwater\ninfrastructure that would supply the city with another 130,000\ncubic metres of clean water a day, Nigusse said.\n\"We believe (these projects) will play a significant role in\nsolving the growing water scarcity problem,\" he said.\n\nGROWING DEMAND\nCurrently, the dams, reservoirs and wells that constitute\nthe Addis Ababa water supply system provide less than two-thirds\nof the 930,000 cubic metres of potable water residents need\nevery day, according to the AAWSA.\nNigusse pointed to Ethiopia's steady economic growth, and\nits rising population, as factors in Addis Ababa's clean water\nshortage.\nThe city's water demands have almost doubled in the past\nfive years, he said, and that demand is rising every day as the\ncapital expands both out and up, with a boom in the construction\nof apartment blocks and offices, Nigusse said.\nBisrat Kifle, a researcher and associate professor at\nEthiopian Civil Service University, said the problem will get\nworse as extreme weather events such as flooding and drought\nbecome more common.\nResearch by Bisrat and his colleagues published in 2017\nestimated that by 2039 Addis Ababa's current population of more\nthan 3.5 million will reach 7 million.\nAs that happens, water scarcity could heighten \"as a result\nof complex interaction of urbanisation and climate change\", it\nnoted.\nThe capital already experiences bouts of heavy rainfall and\n\"we project rainfall will increase and the effect will be\nsiltation (of reservoirs) due to flooding,\" Bisrat said.\nWhen soil washes into reservoirs, it leaves less room for\nstoring water. As a result, he said, Addis Ababa and some of its\nsuburbs could be facing an additional clean water shortfall of\nup to 380 million cubic meters per year.\nThe health consequences of lack of water can be dire, health\nexperts say.\nAmong Ethiopia's population of more than 100 million, about\n42 million people do not have access to safe drinking water,\naccording to the Barcelona-based We Are Water Foundation.\nEach year, 8,500 children under the age of five die due to\ndiseases caused by contaminated water, according to the\nfoundation.\n\nCHALLENGES\nThe state-funded Legedadi Stage II Water Project, estimated\nto cost up to 4 billion birr ($137 million), according to\ngovernment figures, is due to be completed by 2021.\nIt will include 15 new reservoirs to store pumped\ngroundwater and 176 kilometres (109 miles) of pipelines to\ndeliver it, according to AAWSA data.\nFor now, a share of Addis Ababa residents say they have to\nresort to buying water for everything from drinking to cooking\nto washing.\nTewdros in Kirkos said people routinely queued for up to 10\nhours to get water from roadside vendors and water tank trucks.\n\"We carry jerry cans and travel far away and buy 10 litres\nof water for 2 birr ($0.068) which will even be used just for\nhygiene,\" he said, adding that he hoped the government would\ncome through with a solution.\nNigusse told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the\ngovernment's efforts to get potable water to everyone in the\ncity are hampered in part by a system of leaky pipes and by the\ncity's sometimes erratic energy supply.\nA study by the Addis Ababa Institute of Technology published\nin 2012 showed that more than a third of the water running\nthrough the capital's pipes leaked out before getting to\nresidents.\nUnseasonable dry spells, linked to climate change, also are\nhaving an impact on the water supply, Nigusse added.\nAlmost all of the electricity distributed through the\ncountry's power grid comes from hydropower, according to the\nWorld Bank.\nWhen the country gets less rainfall than expected and dam\nlevels drop, so does the power supply - which, in turn, makes it\ndifficult for the government to get enough clean water to\neveryone, including those in the capital.\n\"There are recurrent power shortages, so it is difficult to\npump water from the ground\" into the reservoirs, Nigusse said.\nFor Bisrat, the answer lies not in building more reservoirs,\nbut in making more efficient water use and water conservation a\npriority for households and businesses.\nHe recommended the government introduce a seasonal tariff -\ncharging people more for water during drought - and impose\nfinancial penalties when consumption exceeds a reasonable\namount.\n\"We have to know how to use our resources as a metropolitan\ncity and think about climate change and water scarcity in every\ndecision,\" Bisrat said.\n(Reporting by Dagim Terefe, Editing by Jumana Farouky and\nLaurie Goering.

        "text": "By Sarah  Shearman\nLONDON, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Whether it is\nbuilding schools from plastic waste or opening a cafe staffed by\ntrafficking survivors, social entrepreneurs find innovative and\ncreative ways to solve a diverse range of environmental and\nsocial problems through a business lens.\nAs social entrepreneurship gains traction around the world,\nmisconceptions about the work persist, according to the findings\nof the Thomson Reuters Foundation's second global poll on the\nbest countries for social entrepreneurs.\nThe survey of about 900 social enterprise experts found more\nthan half - or 54% - said the public did not understand what\nthey did. This compared to 58% in the inaugural poll in 2016.\nHere are six frequently asked questions about the sector:\n1. What is a social entrepreneur?\nThere is no universally accepted definition, but broadly a\nsocial entrepreneur can be described as someone who uses\ncommercial strategies to tackle social and environmental\nproblems, prioritising social good while pursuing financial gain\nto sustain their venture and its impact.\n2. Do they run businesses or charities?\nSocial entrepreneurs can structure their organisations as\nnon-profit or for profit. Typically any profits generated from\nthe business are reinvested to advance their stated social cause\nor benefit their community.\n3. When did the term become popular?\nBill Drayton is said to have coined the phrase in the 1980s\nwhen he founded his U.S.-based non-profit Ashoka with the aim of\nsupporting individuals looking to make positive social change\nthough entrepreneurial means.\nSocial entrepreneur started being more widely used in the\n1990s amid a drive by co-operatives and community enterprises\nwanting to use businesses to create social change and an\nincrease in conscious consumerism.\nHowever, over time it has evolved into an umbrella term\noften used to describe a broad range of activities from\nmainstream business that has a social impact to individual\nactivism.\nWithin the sector there is perennial debate over whether a\nmore concrete definition would help or hinder the sector.\n4. Do governments support social entrepreneurs?\nMore nations are considering laws to promote social\nentrepreneurship, with many implementing legal definitions, tax\nincentives and funding to businesses looking to do good.\nBritain has a specific business structure for social\nenterprise, offers tax breaks and this year expanded its law\nincentivising government to buy products and services from\nethical businesses.\nThis year Thailand implemented a law to give tax breaks to\nregistered social enterprises, who commit to reinvesting 70% of\ntheir profits, while Ireland published its first social\nenterprise policy for social enterprises to help build awareness\nand growth.\nWhile government support and recognition are often welcomed,\nthere is continued debate over whether regulation could hamper\ncreativity and innovation within the nascent sector.\n5. How are they funded?\nSocial ventures typically generate income from trading\nproducts or services. Like charities they can seek grant funding\nand, like private companies, they can get investment in various\nforms, such as seed capital or equity.\nThere are many funds designed to specifically help\nbusinesses that deliver social impact, known as impact investing\n\u2013  a fast growing field of finance estimated to amount $502\nbillion, according to Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN), an\nindustry body.\nOther ways that social enterprises can raise funds include\ncrowdfunding, community investment funds and competitions.\n6. What are some of the best known social ventures?\nSome of the most famous social businesses include Grameen\nBank in Bangladesh, Britain's the Big Issue, which hires\nhomeless people to sell streetpapers and sparked a list of\nsimilar organisations globally, and India's Barefoot College,\nwhich aims to improve life in rural villages around the world by\ntraining women skills in solar engineering, healthcare and water\ntesting.\n(Reporting by Sarah Shearman @Shearmans.

        "text": "By Umberto Bacchi\nCOPENHAGEN, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From\nelectric buses to pollution-sucking urban gardens, cities around\nthe world are experimenting with ways to ensure global climate\ngoals are met, as they account for about three-quarters of\nplanet-warming emissions, according to the United Nations.\nHere are seven award-winning initiatives to make cities\ngreener, announced by the C40 network of cities tackling climate\nchange on Thursday:\n\n1. MEDELLIN, Colombia - Colombia's second city has invested\nmore\nthan $16 million to plant almost 9,000 trees to form 30 \"green\ncorridors\" across the city since 2016. Besides capturing\npollution, the plants have helped reduce average temperatures in\nthe city by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) and increased\nbiodiversity, providing friendly habitats for animals.\n2. ACCRA, Ghana - Since 2016, Accra has been working with\nmore than\n600 informal refuse collectors, who used to dump rubbish that\nwas burned at illegal open-air sites, causing pollution. More\nwaste is now being collected, recycled and disposed of safely.\n3. KOLKATA, India - Kolkata is planning to have its entire\n5,000-strong bus fleet, as well as ferries crossing the Ganges\nRiver, run on electricity by 2030. It has bought 80 electric\nbuses and plans to add another 100 next year.\n4. LONDON, United Kingdom - London introduced the world's\nfirst\nUltra Low Emission Zone in 2019, requiring all vehicles passing\nthrough the city centre to meet strict emissions standards or\npay a fee. Within months, the number of more polluting vehicles\nfell by a third as people were pushed to walk, cycle or use\npublic transport.\n5. SAN FRANCISCO, United States - San Francisco's\nCleanPowerSF\nprogramme allows residents to get their electricity completely\nor in large part from renewable sources at competitive rates.\nThe city hopes this will help it achieve a goal of reducing\ngreenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2025.\n6. GUANGZHOU, China - Since 2017, Guangzhou has invested\n$2.1\nbillion to convert its entire fleet of 11,220 buses to run on\nelectricity and installed some 4,000 charging stations to power\nthem. This has reduced air pollution and noise as well as the\ncity's transport system operational costs.\n7. SEOUL, South Korea - Seoul has subsidised the\ninstallation of\nsolar panels on balconies and rooftops of 1 million homes since\n2017, as well as city buildings like schools and parking lots.\nThe city hopes to produce up to 1 GW of solar energy - equal to\nthat generated by a nuclear reactor - by 2022.\nSources: C40, Transport for London, Thomson Reuters\nFoundation\n(Reporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Katy\nMigiro.

The police also\nfroze 42 bank accounts it says were used by the group to finance\ntheir activities.\nAl-Mamun entered Brazil six years ago as a refugee, and was\nliving in Bras, a diverse neighborhood in Sao Paulo that is home\nto immigrants from around the world.\nHe has been indicted on U.S. charges. According to the\nUnited States Department of Justice, Al-Mamun is alleged to have\nhoused people coming from Southeast Asia in S\u00e3o Paulo and\narranged for their travel through a network of smugglers\noperating in Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica,\nNicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico.\nAccording to Brazilian police, he and his group were\nsmuggling into Brazil, and then to the United States, people\nfrom Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan.\nThey were sent to Brazil's northern Acre state to start a\nlong and dangerous trip through Central America all the way to\nthe Mexican border, to cross into the United States.\nReuters was not able to confirm whether Al-Mamun had a\nlawyer in Sao Paulo who could be contacted for comment.\nBrazilian police said the group charged people coming from\nAsia around 50,000 reais ($12,524) for the attempt to reach the\nUnited States. Some would also stay illegally in Brazil, where\nthey were given fraudulent documentation.\nPolice said people suffered violence while waiting in Sao\nPaulo to start the trip north.

        "text": "By Roli Srivastava\nMUMBAI, Oct 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Facebook is\nfailing to rein in a \"tsunami\" of hate posts inflaming ethnic\ntensions in India's Assam state, campaign group Avaaz said on\nWednesday, with content about \"criminals\", \"rapists\",\n\"terrorists\" and \"dogs\" shared almost 100,000 times.\nAvaaz said the dehumanising language - often targeting\nIndia's Bengali Muslims - was similar to that used on Facebook\nabout Myanmar's Rohingya before an army crackdown and ethnic\nviolence forced 700,000 Rohingya to flee in 2017 to Bangladesh.\nA Facebook spokesman said the company was proactively\nremoving 65% of hate speech before it was reported globally, and\nthat its content reviewers, working in at least nine Indian\nlanguages, were rigorously trained to \"catch harmful content\".\nThe United Nations warned of rising hate speech on social\nmedia in India's northeastern Assam state as the government\nprepared to publish a list of Indian citizens in the state that\nleft out nearly 2 million people, many Bengali Muslims.\n\"Facebook is being used as a megaphone for hate, pointed\ndirectly at vulnerable minorities in Assam, many of whom could\nbe made stateless within months,\" Alaphia Zoyab, a campaigner at\nAvaaz, said in a statement.\nTo be included on the register, published in August,\nresidents had to prove their families lived in India before\nMarch 24, 1971, when hundreds of thousands of people began\nfleeing conflict across the border in what is now Bangladesh.\nResentment against illegal immigrants has simmered for years\nin Assam, one of India's poorest states, with residents blaming\noutsiders, mainly Bangladeshis, for taking their jobs and land.\nAvaaz, which campaigns against disinformation on social\nmedia, analysed 800 Facebook posts and comments relating to\nAssam and the register, and found that about 27% constituted\nhate speech, which it estimated had been viewed 5 million times.\nIt flagged 213 posts to Facebook, which removed 96 of them,\nincluding one by an elected official implying that those who\nrape \"our mothers and sisters\" are \"Bangladeshi Muslims\", and\ncalls to \"poison\" daughters and legalise female foeticide.\nFacebook has been criticised for not acting to stamp out\nhate speech on its platform in Myanmar and for not stopping the\nuse of fake accounts aiming to sway public opinion in the 2016\nU.S. election and Britain's vote to leave the European Union.\nAvaaz said Facebook was too reliant on artificial\nintelligence hate speech detection mechanisms, and needed to put\nin place more human-led teams to monitor content in Assam.\n\"Despite the clear and present danger faced by these people,\nFacebook is refusing to dedicate the resources required to keep\nthem safe,\" said Zoyab.\n\"Through its inaction, Facebook is complicit in the\npersecution of some of the world's most vulnerable people.\"\nFacebook's spokesman said the use of artificial intelligence\nhad improved its hate speech detection and that it had invested\nin tools to encourage people to flag up inappropriate content.\n\"While we're making progress, our technology isn't perfect\nyet. That's why reports from our community are still incredibly\nimportant,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Roli Srivastava @Rolionaroll; Editing by Katy\nMigiro.

        "text": "By Ashutosh Sharma\nBOBIYA, India, Oct 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When\nhalf a dozen trucks loaded with construction material screeched\nto a halt on their farms, Baryam Singh and fellow residents in\nthe Indian village of Bobiya sensed they were soon going to lose\nmore land to the military.\nThe farmers chased away the contractors and labourers with\nprotests and threats of deflated tyres, knowing it was only a\ntemporary reprieve.\n\"The military infrastructure has been growing in our village\nand our farmlands are shrinking,\" Singh told the Thomson Reuters\nFoundation, as other farmers sitting around him nodded.\n\"More than 50% of our agricultural land is under military\nlockdown,\" he said of the village on the border with Pakistan.\nOver the past 15 years, the Indian army and the country's\nBorder Security Force (BSF) have been acquiring land to fortify\ndefences in the border districts of Jammu and Kashmir, according\nto the Border Welfare Committee, a local organisation\ncampaigning for the rights of border residents.\nBoth India and Pakistan administer the disputed state of\nKashmir in part while claiming it in full.\nThe fertile land where Jammu and Kashmir meets Pakistan has\nbecome dotted with barbed wire and landmines, leaving hundreds\nof farmers cut off from their farms, often with no warning or\ncompensation, said Bobiya villagers.\n\"This is adding to the economic distress of farmers who\ndon't have alternative sources of livelihood,\" said Singh.\nAfter India revoked the autonomy of its portion of Kashmir\nin August, farmers in border areas now fear losing even more of\ntheir land to the military, according to ID Khajuria, an\nactivist who heads up the Jammu and Kashmir Forum for Peace and\nTerritorial Integrity.\nWith India bringing Jammu and Kashmir deeper into its fold,\nthe central government will have greater power to seize\nterritory in the border regions in the name of national\nsecurity, he warned.\n\"The local elected political representatives will now have a\nvery limited say in the functioning of the (Jammu and Kashmir)\ngovernment,\" Khajuria said.\nJammu divisional commissioner Sanjeev Verma said that all\nfarmers in Jammu province would eventually be paid for their\nland.\n\"Whatever new agricultural land is being acquired, the\nfarmers will get financial compensation,\" he said in a phone\ninterview.\nSome have already been compensated, he added, though he\ndeclined to specify how many.\n'I AM LANDLESS NOW'\nThe defence system includes a fence of about 900 km (560\nmiles) in length that sits several kilometres into India from\nthe border, slicing through villages and leaving vast tracts of\nfarmland on the other side of the fence towards Pakistan.\nIndia's government is also working on a \"Wall of Defence\"\nalong the border between India and Pakistan, according to the\nBorder Security Force.\nThe project consists of a 10-metre-high (32-foot) mud\nembankment to protect residents of India's border villages from\nfrequent ceasefire violations that both sides blame on each\nother.\nThere are also plans to install high-tech surveillance\nsystems to plug gaps where physical surveillance is not\npossible, India's ministry of home affairs announced last year.\nMembers of the Border Welfare Committee - which is based in\nthe city of K    athua - said that thousands of hectares of\nIndian farmland now sit untouched on the other side of the\nfence.\nTechnically, farmers can still get to their land, but the\ncheckpoints in the fence are opened only during specific times\nof day and farmers have to walk for hours to reach their fields,\nexplained Bharat Bhushan Sharma, the committee's vice president.\nEven if they do manage to successfully cultivate their\ncrops, \"there is always a threat of cross-border fire\", said\nSharma, who is also head of Bobiya village.\n\"And then (they) can't protect their crops from wild\nanimals.\"\nCommittee president Nanak Chand, 87, said he lost almost\neight hectares of land to the fence when it was first built in\n2004.\n\"Three months ago, the military acquired the remaining two\nhectares of farmland as well,\" he said. \"I am landless now.\"\nChand was given 3 million rupees ($42,000) as compensation,\nwhich he says is not enough to buy himself an equivalent piece\nof land in a peaceful part of the country.\nKhajuria agreed, saying that \"with developers and\nbusinessmen from other states rushing to Jammu and Kashmir, land\nprices are likely to soar and it would make it difficult for\npoor border residents to buy land in peaceful areas.\"\nIn December 2018, Chand filed a petition with the Jammu and\nKashmir High Court on behalf of farmers living in the border\nareas of the affected districts.\nThe petition called for the government to pay rent for\nfarmland on the Pakistan side of the fence and provide farmers\nwith compensation for each crop season during which their land\nremains uncultivated.\nThe Ministry of Home Affairs, the BSF and the local\nadministration have not yet filed their responses, according to\nlawyers representing the farmers.\nJugal Kishore Sharma, a member of the ruling Bharatiya\nJanata Party who represents the Jammu-Poonch parliamentary\nconstituency, could not specify how much of the land along the\nborder currently being used by the military is farmland.\nBut he said officials in the border districts are in the\nprocess of measuring that amount.\n\"Thereafter, the government will start paying rent to\nfarmers,\" he said in a phone interview.\nWAITING FOR PEACE\nOften times, when the border fence cuts through a farm, it\nalso isolates the village in which the farm is located, said\nMohammad Arif Khan, 67, head of Behrooti village in Poonch\ndistrict.\nAs a result, \"the villages (are) deprived of even the basic\nfacilities and infrastructure,\" he explained.\nThe huge razor-wire fence has turned Behrooti into what\nlocals have described as an open prison.\n\"Our village doesn't have roads and healthcare facilities.\nThere is no internet or mobile phone connectivity,\" said\nMohammad Nisar Khan, 30, another resident.\n\"A zoo is visited by people every day, but here the\noutsiders are not allowed. Socially, we are completely\nisolated.\"\nThe knowledge that the military plans to add high-tech\nsurveillance equipment to the fence is disheartening, said Khan,\nwho like many Indians living on the border is holding out hope\nthat the fence will one day be moved onto the border itself.\n\"We'll become permanent prisoners if the fence gets upgraded\nat its current location,\" he said.\nWhile the residents of Behrooti feel trapped in their\nvillage by the fence, others fear it will force them to leave\ntheir homes for good.\n\"There's little chance that our next generation will be in a\nposition to continue living here (at the border),\" said Meer\nChand, a rice farmer in Nanga village, 30 kilometres (18 miles)\nfrom Bobiya.\n\"We've lost hope that there will ever be peace between India\nand Pakistan. We have neither security of life nor livelihood.\"\n(Reporting by Ashutosh Sharma, Editing by Jumana Farouky and\nZoe Tabary.

        "text": "By Rina Chandran\nBANGKOK, Oct 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Almost 2,000\ninformal settlements in Delhi are set to be legalised under a\nnew law agreed by the government this week, which ministers said\nwould give more than 4 million residents the right to own their\nhomes in India's capital.\nIndia's cabinet this week passed a bill to regularise 1,797\nunauthorised slums in the country's most populous city, giving\nresidents ownership rights at \"minimal rates\" that would enable\nthem to build and sell properties and take loans.\nMapping is to begin shortly, according to a statement from\nthe ministry of housing and urban affairs, with the bill due to\nbe presented for passage during the next session of parliament\nfrom mid-November.\n\"It will transform the lives of more than 40 lakh (4\nmillion) residents who came to Delhi in search of a better life\nand livelihood but were forced to live in squalor,\" said Housing\nMinister Hardeep Singh Puri.\n\"Besides providing a legitimate claim to the property, the\ndecision will encourage property holders to invest in safe\nstructures, thereby improving living conditions in these\ncolonies substantially,\" he said at a press briefing this week.\nThe plan to regularise Delhi's unauthorised settlements had\nbeen floated for more than a decade. Earlier this year, the\nDelhi government said it would study about 1,700 such\nsettlements and consider a plan to legalise them.\nMost inhabitants are migrant workers from other parts of\nIndia who cannot afford regular housing in the city of more than\n18 million people.\nAuthorities have built roads and drains in some settlements,\nbut many lack basic facilities and residents face the constant\nthreat of eviction, according to housing rights activists.\nUnder the proposed law, authorities will map the boundaries\nof the slum areas, and prepare a plan. Residents will have to\nprovide basic documentation and pay a nominal charge to register\ntheir property and receive the title, Puri said.\n\"It will pave the way for incentivised planned urbanisation,\nand transform urban squalor into modern urban spaces with modern\namenities. Work will start immediately,\" he said.\nWorldwide, about 1 billion people live in slums and informal\nsettlements. By 2030, 3 billion people will lack access to\nadequate and affordable housing, according to UN-Habitat, the\nUnited Nations' settlements agency.\nRegularising Delhi's unauthorised colonies has been a\ncampaign promise of many political parties, and this week's\nannouncement comes months ahead of a local election that must be\nheld by February next year.\nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the federal\ngovernment had declined to act on the city's earlier proposal\nfor legalising informal settlements.\n\"While welcome and urgently required, the announcement to\nregularise 'unauthorised' colonies has been made so many times\nwithout being implemented, that it is unclear what it means,\"\nsaid Shivani Chaudhry, executive director, Housing and Land\nRights Network, a non-profit in Delhi.\nThe regularisation process must be an inclusive one that\ndoes not exclude people on account of faulty surveys, minor\ntechnicalities, or their inability to pay, she told the Thomson\nReuters Foundation on Friday.\n\"It must ensure equal access to basic services, adequate\nhousing, and protection from demolition and eviction.\"\n(Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Michael\nTaylor.

        "text": "By Sarah  Shearman\nLONDON, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Whether it is\nbuilding schools from plastic waste or opening a cafe staffed by\ntrafficking survivors, social entrepreneurs find innovative and\ncreative ways to solve a diverse range of environmental and\nsocial problems through a business lens.\nAs social entrepreneurship gains traction around the world,\nmisconceptions about the work persist, according to the findings\nof the Thomson Reuters Foundation's second global poll on the\nbest countries for social entrepreneurs.\nThe survey of about 900 social enterprise experts found more\nthan half - or 54% - said the public did not understand what\nthey did. This compared to 58% in the inaugural poll in 2016.\nHere are six frequently asked questions about the sector:\n1. What is a social entrepreneur?\nThere is no universally accepted definition, but broadly a\nsocial entrepreneur can be described as someone who uses\ncommercial strategies to tackle social and environmental\nproblems, prioritising social good while pursuing financial gain\nto sustain their venture and its impact.\n2. Do they run businesses or charities?\nSocial entrepreneurs can structure their organisations as\nnon-profit or for profit. Typically any profits generated from\nthe business are reinvested to advance their stated social cause\nor benefit their community.\n3. When did the term become popular?\nBill Drayton is said to have coined the phrase in the 1980s\nwhen he founded his U.S.-based non-profit Ashoka with the aim of\nsupporting individuals looking to make positive social change\nthough entrepreneurial means.\nSocial entrepreneur started being more widely used in the\n1990s amid a drive by co-operatives and community enterprises\nwanting to use businesses to create social change and an\nincrease in conscious consumerism.\nHowever, over time it has evolved into an umbrella term\noften used to describe a broad range of activities from\nmainstream business that has a social impact to individual\nactivism.\nWithin the sector there is perennial debate over whether a\nmore concrete definition would help or hinder the sector.\n4. Do governments support social entrepreneurs?\nMore nations are considering laws to promote social\nentrepreneurship, with many implementing legal definitions, tax\nincentives and funding to businesses looking to do good.\nBritain has a specific business structure for social\nenterprise, offers tax breaks and this year expanded its law\nincentivising government to buy products and services from\nethical businesses.\nThis year Thailand implemented a law to give tax breaks to\nregistered social enterprises, who commit to reinvesting 70% of\ntheir profits, while Ireland published its first social\nenterprise policy for social enterprises to help build awareness\nand growth.\nWhile government support and recognition are often welcomed,\nthere is continued debate over whether regulation could hamper\ncreativity and innovation within the nascent sector.\n5. How are they funded?\nSocial ventures typically generate income from trading\nproducts or services. Like charities they can seek grant funding\nand, like private companies, they can get investment in various\nforms, such as seed capital or equity.\nThere are many funds designed to specifically help\nbusinesses that deliver social impact, known as impact investing\n\u2013  a fast growing field of finance estimated to amount $502\nbillion, according to Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN), an\nindustry body.\nOther ways that social enterprises can raise funds include\ncrowdfunding, community investment funds and competitions.\n6. What are some of the best known social ventures?\nSome of the most famous social businesses include Grameen\nBank in Bangladesh, Britain's the Big Issue, which hires\nhomeless people to sell streetpapers and sparked a list of\nsimilar organisations globally, and India's Barefoot College,\nwhich aims to improve life in rural villages around the world by\ntraining women skills in solar engineering, healthcare and water\ntesting.\n(Reporting by Sarah Shearman @Shearmans.

        "text": "By Annie Banerji\nHYDERABAD, Oct 18 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Thought\nmobile phone towers were just for calls and messages? They can\nalso help predict rainfall, telecoms experts said on Friday, a\npotential game-changer for farmers in developing countries such\nas India and Sri Lanka.\nMany emerging economies cannot afford sophisticated\nforecasting tools such as ground-based radar and rain-gauge\nnetworks, making it harder to predict seasonal rains that are\nthe lifeblood for farmers in many Asian countries.\n\"Weather information - that's the number one need farmers\nhave more than anything else,\" said Daniele Tricarico, who works\non agritech at the mobile communications industry body GSMA.\n\"We are trying to use very useful mobile operator data to\nprovide better, enhanced services to small-holder farmers for\nclimate resilience,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at\nan agricultural conference in Hyderabad in south India.\nMobile phone towers transmit radio signals that are\ndisturbed when it rains, providing data that enables local\nweather agencies to improve the accuracy of their rainfall\npredictions.\nThe sheer number of mobile phone towers means the data can\nhelp provide forecasts of up to 90% accuracy, said Tricarico,\nfilling the equipment gap at no extra cost and giving more\nlocation-specific, high-resolution data than satellites provide.\nThe forecasts can be sent to farmers through calls and text\nmessages, helping them plan when to sow their seeds or use\nfertilisers, said Damitha Gunawardena, digital inclusion manager\nat Sri Lanka's largest mobile phone operator, Dialog Axiata.\nImproved forecasting is key to helping farmers deal with the\nimpact of climate change, which is making weather patterns\nharder to predict, he said.\nAccording to the World Bank, climate change effects could\ncost India 2.8% of its GDP and reduce the living standards of\nnearly half the country's 1.2 billion population by 2050.\n\"If you talk to any farmer, they'll say climate has been\nchanging so much that they have no idea what to expect any\nmore,\" said Gunawardena. \"And that's making farmers move out of\nagriculture.\"\nImproved access to data could also encourage greater uptake\nof crop insurance among small-scale farmers, most of whom are\nuninsured, he said, providing a crucial safety net as climate\nchange increases the risks around agriculture.\nCurrently, the most popular insurance schemes in the region\nare based on satellite imagery or agents visiting fields in\nperson.\nUsing mobile phone towers would allow insurers to pinpoint\nwhere rain has fallen more accurately, said Gunawardena, calling\nit a \"game-changer\" for farmers.\nIn India, where agriculture makes up about 15% of a $2.5\ntrillion economy, farmers are often on the front lines of\nclimate change impacts - from severe droughts, unpredictable\nrainfall, frequent floods to powerful cyclones.\nThe heaviest monsoon rains to lash India in 25 years\ntriggered floods that killed hundreds in late September. It also\nled to crops being washed away or\nrotting.\nWhile the United States and some European countries have\nbegun to use mobile phone networks commercially to predict rain,\ndeveloping nations may take another few years, said Tricarico.\nSeveral hurdles stand in the way, including customising\nsoftwares and algorithms to specific climates, regulatory\npermissions and chalking out business models, he said.\nIn January, Boston-based ClimaCell partnered with\nMumbai-based charitable foundation Tata Trusts with the aim to\nstart such a service in India.\nPilot projects are under way in Nigeria, Sri Lanka and\nBangladesh.\n\"Results have been promising so far. And since we know it\ncan be done, it's only a matter of time,\" said Dialog's\nGunawardena.\n\n(Reporting by Annie Banerji @anniebanerji, Editing by Claire\nCozens.

They should be a part of urban planning,\"\nSutanudjaja told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nResidents, many of whom have lived there for generations,\nhave valuable knowledge of disaster preparedness, flood\nmitigation and other risks linked to climate change, she said.\n\"Kampungs are living spaces with problems with sanitation\nand housing that reduce their resilience, so we also don't want\nto romanticise them. But demolition is not an answer,\" she said.\nThere is also risk attached to success: George Town on\nPenang island, off Malaysia's west coast, is a UNESCO world\nheritage site that is hugely popular with tourists that many\nresidents blame for congestion and higher rents.\nUnder-pressure cities need a conservation approach when\nmodernising, which includes residents to keeps alive traditional\nknowledge and cultures such as foods, clothing and music, said\nSaswat Bandyopadhyay, an urban planning professor at CEPT\nUniversity in Ahmedabad, India.\n\"The loss of heritage is irreversible - once it's gone, it's\ngone. So we must be doing everything we can to preserve it.\"\n(Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Michael\nTaylor.

Under-Secretary-General Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana\nsaid at an urban conference in Penang.\n\"Fast-evolving technologies have the potential to transform\nthe traditional way of doing things across all government\nfunctions and domains,\" she said, adding that public-private\npartnerships will be key.\nWorldwide, the rise of cloud-computing and artificial\nintelligence (AI) technologies have led to data-gathering\nstreetlights in China, autonomous buses in Singapore and facial\nrecognition systems in Indian airports.\nAI, which includes machine-learning, autonomous and data\nprocessing systems, is currently being used in crime prevention,\ntrademark applications and to improve crop yields, according to\na U.N. study https://www.unescap.org/publications/artificial-intelligence-delivery-public-services\nreleased this week.\nBut the increased use of data, and of systems such as facial\nrecognition software and closed-circuit television have also\nsparked concerns over bias, security, privacy and surveillance.\nWith systems of social assistance increasingly being driven\nby data and technologies, there is \"a grave risk of stumbling\nzombie-like into a digital welfare dystopia\", said Philip\nAlston, the U.N. special rapporteur on poverty and human rights.\nThis is \"especially problematic when the private sector is\ntaking a leading role in designing, constructing, and even\noperating significant parts of the digital welfare state\",\nAlston warned in a report last week.\nTechnology companies operate in an almost \"human rights-free\nzone\", he added.\nGovernments can guard against this by putting in adequate\nsafeguards, and ensuring that there is good planning and\ngovernance, said Lim Teng Leng, deputy director at the\nSingaporean government's Centre for Liveable Cities.\nTechnology-based solutions are no panacea for city problems,\nand can often cause just as many problems as they set out to\naddress, he said.\n\"Smart Cities cannot be a measure of how advanced the\ntechnologies are, but how these technologies are used to solve\nproblems,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\"People have to believe that all this data will improve\ntheir lives, make their cities better and safer. The government\nmust build trust by being upfront about what data they are\ncollecting, what it is for, and admit when there are mistakes.\"\nThis is particularly relevant to poorer residents and those\nwho are not tech-savvy and may be excluded, said Colin Fernandes\nat the Global Disaster Preparedness Center, a unit of the\nAmerican Red Cross.\n\"Data collection often misses those in informal settlements,\nwho are usually the most vulnerable to disasters and climate\nchange risks, and most in need of welfare benefits and other\nassistance,\" he said.\n\"There is a failure to collect data, or a reluctance on\ntheir part to give up data, because they don't know whether the\ndata will be used to evict them or protect them. They need to be\nassured of what they are signing up for.\"\n(Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Michael\nTaylor.

Food and\nAgriculture Organization (FAO).\n\"Educate girls, fertility rates come down, women enter the\nlabour force. That's true across every country, every religion,\"\nsaid Sachs, who advised governments and the United Nations on\nthe latest global goals agreed in 2015 to tackle these issues.\nU.N. figures show that 130 million girls of school age\nglobally are not in school, and the world's highest rate of\nteenage pregnancy \u2014 143 per 1,000 girls aged 15\u201319 years \u2014 is in\nsub-Saharan Africa.\nCurrent projections show the population of Africa could more\nthan triple to 4.3 billion by 2100 from about 1.3 billion today.\n\"If Africa stays on this demographic trajectory, it's\nimpossible to end hunger and it is impossible to end poverty,\"\nsaid Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development\nat Columbia University in New York.\n\"Not only will those numbers run far ahead of any\ninfrastructure imaginable and any public services imaginable,\nbut the pressures on the physical land would be impossible,\nespecially in an era of climate change.\"\nHe urged developed nations and donors to ensure all children\nacross the globe completed secondary school.\nSachs said climate change and conflicts - which experts say\nare the main drivers of global hunger which has been rising for\nthree years in a row - are \"utterly within our control\".\n\"We need to end the use of coal, oil and gas and move to\nwind, hydrogen, solar, geothermal and other zero-carbon energy\nsources and to complete that transformation by mid-century,\" he\nsaid.\nIn Africa, for example, replacing wood stoves with\nrenewables could be done within 10 years, he said.\n\"It's a matter of placing the solar panels. And Africa is\nblessed with wonderful solar energy. It could power the whole\ncontinent,\" said Sachs.\n\"There is no problem that we face for which solutions have\nnot been identified ... but we have been under-investing in\nthese solutions.\"\n(Reporting By Thin Lei Win @thinink, Editing by Belinda\nGoldsmith\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, climate\nchange, women's and LGBT+ rights, human trafficking, and\nproperty rights.

        "text": "By Annie Banerji\nNEW DELHI, Oct 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Shoved,\ncursed and ridiculed, Nisha's hospital visits were always\nstressful as a transgender woman and got worse after she was\ndiagnosed as HIV-positive.\nBut a new app introduced as part of a drive to end an HIV\nepidemic in India by 2030 is providing her and the transgender\ncommunity better access to doctors, lifesaving drugs - and hope\n- although it has raised concerns about digital privacy.\nIndia has the world's third largest population living with\nHIV - 2.1 million people - according to UNAIDS, with recognition\nthat help is needed in the transgender community where the\nprevalence is 3.1% compared to 0.26% among all adults.\nNisha tested HIV positive last year after earning a living\nas a sex worker in New Delhi. On the job, she said, condoms\nwould often break or she would not use one for more money.\n\"That was a bad idea. I ended up with HIV. I felt suicidal\nafter I found out,\" Nisha, 29, a trans woman who goes by one\nname, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\"It didn't help that going to the hospital was torturous.\nPeople made faces, passed lewd comments ... a doctor even kicked\nme out.\"\nDespite the Supreme Court recognising India's 2 million\ntransgender people as a third gender with equal rights in 2014,\nthey are often kicked out by their families and denied jobs,\neducation and healthcare, leading them to begging or sex work.\nTrans women like Nisha say they face \"double discrimination\"\nand the risk of being shunned and abused - first because of\ntheir gender identity and then because of their HIV status.\nBut a counselling programme along with a new app is helping\nhealth workers track down HIV-positive transgender people,\nmonitor their treatment and link them to doctors and\nantiretroviral therapy (ART) to suppress the AIDS virus.\n\"I have found new strength. I don't feel depressed or\nnervous anymore,\" said Nisha, who now begs at traffic lights.\n\"The app helps keep me physically healthy and she ensures\nI'm mentally and emotionally (healthy),\" she said, pointing to\nher outreach worker Samyra, an HIV-positive trans woman.\nThe eMpower app - developed by IBM in partnership with India\nHIV/AIDS Alliance and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\nTuberculosis and Malaria - monitored more than 1.2 million\npeople between January 2018 and March 2019.\n\n'HALF THE BATTLE WON'\nWith mobile tablets in hand, HIV-positive transgender\noutreach workers keep a tab on others in their community living\nwith HIV and counsel them and accompany them to see doctors.\n\"I tell them 'I'm like you. I'm HIV-positive and I'm taking\nmedicines too. You're not alone',\" said Samyra, who works with\nVihaan, a national initiative to expand counselling, outreach\nand follow-up programmes to people living with HIV.\n\"That makes a huge difference because it's coming from one\nof your own. Half of the HIV battle is won when you have someone\nto hold your hand along the way.\"\nHealth experts said transgender focused initiatives like\nthis and the launch in March of India's first HIV treatment\nclinic in Mumbai city run for and by LGBT+ people were pushing\nthe country towards its target to end the epidemic by 2030.\nBut to achieve this target they said it was critical for\npatients to stick with ART. Sometimes stigma and side effects\ncan cause them to drop out of the treatment.\nThat is why health workers follow up with clients every few\nmonths and record information on the eMpower app, including\ntheir weight, viral load and CD4 - white blood cells that fight\nHIV - and advise them on everything from their diet to safe sex.\nThey also note whether a client has faced discrimination,\nand arrange for partners and family members to get tested.\nSonal Mehta, head of India HIV/AIDS Alliance, said the app\nhas helped boost Vihaan's outreach numbers as well as the\nconfidence of trans clients and workers, who often come from\npoor, semi-literate backgrounds.\n\"The trans clients definitely feel much more secure ... but\nthe outreach workers themselves also feel very empowered. They\nare professional officers working on the field, talking to\ndoctors, government officers, engaging with various\norganisations,\" she said.\n\nDOUBLE-EDGED SWORD\nWhile such technological advances are seen as key in the\nHIV/AIDS fight, health and software experts warn they can come\nat the cost of privacy.\nThe eMpower app creates a profile for each client with\npersonal information including name, biometric ID number,\noccupation and monthly income, and a map pinning their location.\nWithout proper safeguards, such an app runs the risk of data\nbreach and sharing information with third-parties, which can\nfurther ostracise an already marginalised community, said Ambika\nTandon, a cyber security expert.\n\"The potential to monetise is definitely a risk factor,\"\nsaid Tandon, policy officer in gender-based research at the\nBanaglore-based Centre for Internet and Society.\n\"Another is informational privacy ... (clients) may not\nnecessarily know where their information is being stored, who\nwill have access to it ... There could be multiple points at\nwhich their data could be vulnerable.\"\nSaravanan RM, a senior technical officer at India HIV/AIDS\nAlliance, said the eMpower app a \"fool-proof system\".\nHe said all sensitive data was stored on the organisation's\nserver, which could only be accessed by specific workers through\na password-protected system.\nNone of the information can be seen by any partners - not\nIBM, state or federal governments. It is further beefed up by a\nmobile device management (MDM), he said.\n\"For example, if any device is lost or has gone into someone\nelse's hands, what we can do through MDM is clean out the entire\ntablet and the data will not be acquired,\" he said.\nDr. V Sam Prasad, India programme manager of the AIDS\nHealthcare Foundation, said the app should not be dismissed\nbecause there was a privacy risk as it came with major benefits.\nSeveral HIV-positive transgender people like Swati, a trans\nwoman who contracted HIV after injecting drugs, felt the same.\n\"Even if it (personal data) is leaked, what's the worst that\ncould happen? I've faced unimaginable things. Nothing scares me,\nat least not such things,\" said Swati, 25, after a follow-up\nmeeting with her outreach worker at her one-room home.\n\"It is (eMpower) saving me. It is not an enemy.\"\n($1 = 71.0540 Indian rupees)\n(Reporting by Annie Banerji @anniebanerji, Editing by Belinda\nGoldsmith\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters that covers humanitarian issues, conflicts,\nland and property rights, modern slavery and human trafficking,\ngender equality, climate change and resilience.

It seems to be a case of\nfemale infanticide,\" he said, adding that the baby was about\nfive days old.\nThe baby was rushed to a nearby hospital, where she is\nrecovering, he said. Police are looking for the parents.\nIndia has seen a dwindling number of girls, according to a\ngovernment survey released in July, suggesting that illegal\nabortions of female fetuses continue despite a ban and\ngovernment efforts to save girl children.\nIt showed that India's gender ratio, or the number of\nfemales per 1,000 males, was 896 in the period of 2015-17, down\nfrom 898 in 2014-16 and 900 in 2013-15. The number was 943 in\nthe last census of 2011.\nIndian laws ban doctors and health workers from sharing an\nunborn child's sex with the parents, or carrying out tests to\ndetermine the child's gender. Only registered medical\npractitioners are allowed to perform abortions.\nYet female feticide is common in parts of India. Daughters\nare often seen as a burden, with families having to pay dowries\nwhen they marry, while sons are prized as breadwinners who can\ninherit property and continue the family name.\nIn 2017, police found nearly 20 aborted fetuses dumped in\nplastic bags in the western state of Maharashtra.\n(Reporting by Annie Banerji @anniebanerji, Editing by Belinda\nGoldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the\ncharitable arm of Thomson Reuters that covers humanitarian\nissues, conflicts, land and property rights, modern slavery and\nhuman trafficking, gender equality, climate change and\nresilience.

It is the address\nof India's most famous monument - the Taj Mahal - on a mapping\napp that aims to help millions of slum dwellers, rural\nresidents, refugees and those in need of emergency aid.\nAs smartphones become a common sight in developing nations\nand mapping technologies get more advanced, apps such as\nWhat3Words, CitoCode and Google's Plus Code are making it\npossible to locate even the world's most remote areas on a map.\nBut it is particularly useful in a country like India, where\nmore than a quarter of the urban population lives in informal\nsettlements which may lack street names and house numbers, said\nGiles Rhys Jones, chief marketing officer at What3Words.\n\"The lack of a formal address can be very limiting - from\ndifficulty in receiving post to being unable to open a bank\naccount or vote,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by\nphone from London.\n\"Having a uniform system is a potentially radical shift, as\nit enables digitisation of databases of addresses, land\nadministration geoportals, and accurate disaster and emergency\nservice responses,\" he said on Friday.\nWhat3Words divides the Earth into 3 metre x 3 metre squares\nand assigns each box a unique three-word address.

MEDELLIN, Colombia - Colombia's second city has invested\nmore\nthan $16 million to plant almost 9,000 trees to form 30 \"green\ncorridors\" across the city since 2016. Besides capturing\npollution, the plants have helped reduce average temperatures in\nthe city by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) and increased\nbiodiversity, providing friendly habitats for animals.\n2. ACCRA, Ghana - Since 2016, Accra has been working with\nmore than\n600 informal refuse collectors, who used to dump rubbish that\nwas burned at illegal open-air sites, causing pollution. More\nwaste is now being collected, recycled and disposed of safely.\n3. KOLKATA, India - Kolkata is planning to have its entire\n5,000-strong bus fleet, as well as ferries crossing the Ganges\nRiver, run on electricity by 2030. It has bought 80 electric\nbuses and plans to add another 100 next year.\n4. LONDON, United Kingdom - London introduced the world's\nfirst\nUltra Low Emission Zone in 2019, requiring all vehicles passing\nthrough the city centre to meet strict emissions standards or\npay a fee. Within months, the number of more polluting vehicles\nfell by a third as people were pushed to walk, cycle or use\npublic transport.\n5. SAN FRANCISCO, United States - San Francisco's\nCleanPowerSF\nprogramme allows residents to get their electricity completely\nor in large part from renewable sources at competitive rates.\nThe city hopes this will help it achieve a goal of reducing\ngreenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2025.\n6. GUANGZHOU, China - Since 2017, Guangzhou has invested\n$2.1\nbillion to convert its entire fleet of 11,220 buses to run on\nelectricity and installed some 4,000 charging stations to power\nthem. This has reduced air pollution and noise as well as the\ncity's transport system operational costs.\n7. SEOUL, South Korea - Seoul has subsidised the\ninstallation of\nsolar panels on balconies and rooftops of 1 million homes since\n2017, as well as city buildings like schools and parking lots.\nThe city hopes to produce up to 1 GW of solar energy - equal to\nthat generated by a nuclear reactor - by 2022.\nSources: C40, Transport for London, Thomson Reuters\nFoundation\n(Reporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Katy\nMigiro.

We just need\nto regularise them so that other citizens are not\ninconvenienced,\" Kejriwal posted on Twitter.\n\"Vendors will get the right to make an honest living, and\nthey will not be harassed by the police and other authorities,\"\nhe said, adding that licences would be issued before the end of\nthe year.\nWith Asian towns and cities expanding and striving to become\nmore international and attract investment, street vendors and\nhawkers are viewed increasingly as a hindrance to city planning.\nVendors selling everything from snacks and tea to toys and\nclothes are a common sight in India's cities, with items for\nsale spread out on pavements or in mobile carts.\nThe Street Vendors' Act was introduced by federal lawmakers\nin 2014 to help protect the country's hawkers from eviction,\nwith states required to establish hawking zones, set up TVCs and\nissue licences.\nUnlicensed hawkers are often targeted for bribes by\ncriminals or corrupt officials and police, and flee eviction\ndrives which are becoming more common as cities modernise and\ncompetition for space grows from pedestrians and cars.\n\"The law emerged after a long struggle for improved\nlivelihood security, legality and protection from eviction,\"\nsaid Shivani Chaudhry, executive director of the Housing and\nLand Rights Network, a non-profit in Delhi.\n\"Street vendors form the backbone of the city economy.\nNon-implementation of the law has resulted in their continued\npersecution, including arbitrary evictions, and lack of\nrecognition of their rights,\" she said.\nNo states had fully implemented the 2014 act, according to\nthe National Association of Street Vendors of India (NASVI).\nMembers of NASVI, who are staging a protest in Delhi on\nThursday against the slow rollout of the law, said there was\nstill no detailed plan for its implementation in the capital.\n\"There is a lack of political will to implement the law, and\nthere is a pushback from citizens because of the misconception\nthat vendors cause congestion,\" said Shalini Sinha at WIEGO, a\nglobal non-profit that helps informal workers.\n\"But walkability is not at odds with street vending, and\nauthorities should be more concerned about livelihoods than\nvehicle parking,\" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nDelhi has now set up 28 TVCs with representatives from\nstreet vendors, the municipal commission, police and town\nplanners, who will conduct the survey.\nBut there are few other details on the law's rollout, said\nArbind Singh, a coordinator for NASVI.\n\"The same authorities promised implementation five years\nago. Now, with local elections in Delhi due soon, the promise of\nimplementation looks to be just a political gimmick,\" he said,\nreferring to polls due by February next year.\n\"Meanwhile, evictions continue - so we are very skeptical.\"\n(Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Michael\nTaylor.

        "text": "By Rina Chandran\nMUMBAI, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Just hours\nafter the high court dismissed petitions against cutting trees\nin a heavily wooded area in suburban Mumbai for a metro rail\ndepot, hundreds of protesters swarmed the site, crying and\nclinging to trees as the felling began.\nIt was an unusual display of emotion for normally stoic\nMumbaikars, who braved arrests on Friday night to try and stop\nthe cutting of nearly 3,000 trees in Aarey Colony, known as the\nIndian city's \"green lung\".\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court, after hearing a petition,\nstayed the cutting of more trees until Oct. 21.\nAs rising heat and frequent floods batter some of the\nworld's most densely populated and polluted cities in India,\nurban residents are rallying around fast disappearing green\nspaces seen as vital safeguards.\nIn the southern city of Bengaluru, residents protested the\ncutting of hundreds of trees for a flyover, while a petition led\nthe Supreme Court to slam the amendment of a colonial-era law to\nopen up the Aravalli mountains for real estate development.\n\"Earlier, villages bore the brunt of climate-change impacts,\nbut now cities are also experiencing flooding, air pollution and\nwater scarcity more often,\" said Kanchi Kohli, a researcher at\nthe Centre for Policy Research think tank in Delhi.\n\"People have realised that disappearing green spaces are a\npart of the problem, and there is a strong determination to\nfight on the streets and in the courts because they see no other\nway to make themselves heard,\" she said.\nWith almost 70% of the world's population estimated to be\nliving in cities by 2050, mainly in Africa and Asia, cities will\nbear the brunt of warming temperatures, climate experts warn.\nAsia's booming cities are losing green spaces as a\nconstruction boom gobbles up land for offices and apartments,\nworsening the heat island effect and causing flooding that has\nkilled hundreds from Mumbai to Manila, according to\nenvironmentalists.\n\"We're not saying, don't cut a single tree; we're only\nsaying don't needlessly cut trees because there simply aren't\nenough trees,\" said Zoru Bathena, an activist who has filed\nseveral petitions against tree felling in Mumbai.\n\"Why should development always be at the cost of the\nenvironment?\"\n\nNET LOSS\nA fifth of the world's major cities will face \"unknown\"\nclimate conditions by 2050, as rising temperatures heighten the\nrisks of drought and flooding, scientists at the Crowther Lab in\nSwitzerland have warned.\nCities in tropical regions such as South Asia are likely to\nsee some of the strongest impacts, the study showed.\nNearly 300 people died in floods in 2015 in the coastal city\nof Chennai, where floodplains have long been built over.\nMumbai's tree cover has fallen to less than 13% from more\nthan 35% in the 1970s, according to the Indian Institute of\nScience, which recommends green cover of a third of total area.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to restore\n26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030 through tree\nplanting and other means, alongside a push to switch to electric\nvehicles by 2030 to cut carbon emissions.\nBut the loss of green spaces in urban areas cannot be offset\nby planting trees elsewhere, said Chetan Agarwal, an analyst at\nthe Centre for Ecology, Development and Research.\n\"The loss of green spaces in cities represents a net\necological loss, as large numbers of people are concentrated\nthere and are deprived of their benefits,\" he said.\n\"Small and large green spaces provide a toehold for nature\nin the city, with manifold benefits including better air quality\nand overall health,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nFrom Athens to Seoul, big cities worldwide are planting more\ntrees to minimise the severity of heatwaves and floods, and to\nboost people's physical and mental health.\nThe United Nations recently unveiled plans to create urban\nforests in cities in Africa and Asia to improve air quality, cut\nthe risk of floods and heatwaves, and halt land degradation.\n\nDUST STORMS\nNearly 30% of India's land area has been degraded through\ndeforestation, over-cultivation and depletion of wetlands,\naccording to the government.\nThis is evident in the Aravalli mountains, which run through\nfour states for a distance of nearly 700km (435 miles).\nDilution of environmental laws over the years have led to\ndeforestation, construction and illegal mining, causing\ndesertification, drying up of lakes, and more frequent dust\nstorms.\nThe Delhi Ridge, a stretch of the Aravallis, acts as lungs\nfor the city's toxic smog, and is a cherished green space.\nIn February, Haryana state amended the Punjab Land\nPreservation Act of 1900 to open up thousands of acres of forest\nland in the Aravallis for construction and mining, sparking\nprotests in Delhi and in neighbouring Gurugram.\nDays later, the Supreme Court, responding to a petition by\nenvironmentalists, said it was \"shocking\" that the Haryana\ngovernment was destroying the forest, and that the new law\ncannot be enforced without the court's permission.\n\"The loss of the Aravallis will impact water security,\nfragment wildlife habitat and corridors, and reduce the capacity\nto mitigate air pollution in Delhi and elsewhere,\" said Agarwal.\nBut as urban populations expand rapidly, land is needed for\nhousing and transport, authorities say, putting pressure on\ngreen spaces including cemeteries.\n\"We do not wish to cut even a single tree in Aarey, but\ndevelopment is also important. We will plant more trees in place\nof those cut,\" said Devendra Fadnavis, chief minister of\nMaharashtra state where Mumbai is located.\nThe densely wooded area, spread over 16 sq km (6 sq miles),\nis home to 27 tribal villages and various animal species,\nincluding leopards.\nOver the past few decades, swathes of land have been\nallocated for slum resettlement, a defence training unit and a\nzoo. The site for the metro shed is a 33-hectare plot.\n\"We're not against the metro; we all want better public\ntransport. But this is just a shed - it can be built elsewhere\nwithout cutting so many trees,\" said Bathena.\nCommitments to increasing forest cover and cutting carbon\nemissions are not enough, said Kohli.\n\"Building a flyover, or a metro shed by cutting down trees\ncan get us more convenience, but at what cost?\"\n\"We have to ask whose desires dominate, and if this is the\nsustainable urban vision we want,\" she said.\n(Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Zoe\nTabary.

        "text": "By Roli Srivastava and Naimul Karim\nSOUTH 24 PARGANAS, India/DHAKA, Oct 9 (Thomson Reuters\nFoundation) - P riya was 15 when a relative in Bangladesh tricked\nher with the promise of a dream job as a singer, drugged her,\nand trafficked her across the border into the sex trade in\nIndia.\nAfter several failed attempts to escape the brothel in the\neastern state of West Bengal where she was trapped for six\nyears, Priya was rescued along with other girls from Bangladesh\nand India in a raid by police and anti-trafficking campaigners.\nHeading home and pursuing her musical ambitions beckoned, or\nso she thought. But three years after her rescue, the prospects\nof making it back to her family appeared ever more distant.\nFor Priya, now 24, was one of about 180 Bangladeshi sex\ntrafficking survivors stuck in shelters in West Bengal - with\nmany having waited years for official clearance to go home due\nto complex and lengthy bureaucracy across the two countries.\n\"How long can I wait?\", said Priya, using her 'brothel name'\nto hide her identity for fear of being shamed in Bangladesh.\n\"Maybe I won't go now even if they ask me to,\" she said last\nmonth at a shelter, sitting in a room adorned with paper roses.\nVictims wishing to return home must first gain approval from\npolice, social workers, judges, border forces and bureaucrats at\nboth state and federal level, a process that involves about 15\nsteps, analysis by the Thomson Reuters Foundation has revealed.\nWhile the two nations are working towards faster returns,\nthe long waits facing dozens of survivors could stymie their\nefforts to start life afresh back home and leave them vulnerable\nto being trafficked again, according to activists.\n\"Living in a shelter ... can be traumatic,\" said Tariqul\nIslam of Justice and Care, a charity that reintegrates victims\nin Bangladesh. \"When they return after two years or more, it\nbecomes hard for them to adjust to the changes and recover.\"\n\"Traffickers often keep track of their victims even after\nthey return home. When they notice that the girl does not have a\njob, or is finding it hard to adjust, they target her again.\"\n\nFASTER RETURNS AFOOT\nThousands of Bangladeshis are trafficked to India each year\n- many of whom are sold into prostitution or domestic servitude\n- anti-slavery activists say, although official data is lacking.\nIn the last eight years, Bangladesh has brought home about\n1,750 trafficking survivors from India, predominantly women and\ngirls in West Bengal and the western state of Maharashtra.\nHowever anti-slavery charities that help victims in India\nsay most are kept in shelters for years - first awaiting the\nconclusion of court proceedings, then the repatriation process.\nJustice is often slow and convictions are rare. One in four\ntrafficking cases in India leads to conviction, while in\nBangladesh, only 30 convictions have been secured under a 2012\nlaw, with more than 4,000 cases still awaiting trial.\nIndia and Bangladesh signed a partnership in 2015 to speed\nup repatriations, but how a victim is treated - whether it is\ntheir experience with the judiciary or the wait to go home -\nvaries from one Indian state to another, according to activists.\nA long-awaited deal aimed at streamlining the system is to\nbe finalised soon, officials from the two governments said.\n\"At the moment it sometimes takes 18 to 22 months,\" said\nFerdousi Akhter, joint secretary with Bangladesh's interior\nministry. Yet charities say it can drag on for up to six years.\n\"A victim has to go through many layers to be repatriated\nfrom India,\" Akhter added. \"We are in talks to cut down these\nlayers ... victims can surely make faster returns.\"\nSLEEPLESS NIGHTS\nIn a small house on the outskirts of Bangladesh's capital\nDhaka, mother-of-two Basiron remembered the call to say her\nmissing daughters had been found in a brothel in India a year\nafter they disappeared.\n\"When I heard the news, I screamed! I felt as though my\nheart was going to burst,\" the 47-year-old single parent said.\nThe girls - now aged 16 and 17 - were rescued in 2017 from a\nbrothel in West Bengal where they were held in one room, beaten,\nplied with drink and drugs until addicted, and repeatedly raped.\nTwo years on, they are still waiting to go home.\nCharges against the 16 people arrested in their trafficking\ncase are yet to be filed in court, which refused them permission\nto return and testify from Bangladesh.\nAt a shelter for trafficking victims in a village in West\nBengal, the two sisters showed off sketches of huts surrounded\nby trees and a river - their way of remembering home.\nThe younger girl, Neela, said she wanted to take out a loan\nand set up a beauty parlour when she finally returns home.\n\"The Indian girls who were rescued with us went back home in\nno time,\" said Neela, whose right arm was covered with scars -\nevidence of self-harm during her time in the brothel.\n\"We feel happy for them. Maybe we too will go back one day.\"\nBasiron and her daughters stay in touch through occasional\nphone calls - they do not discuss the case but talk about meals\nand movies they have enjoyed - yet the mother is losing hope\nover their return and is increasingly worried for their safety.\n\"There are times when I see reports on the news about\nchildren getting kidnapped or killed ... those nights are the\nhardest to sleep,\" said Basiron, who works as a domestic helper.\n\"I haven't seen them in three years. Not even a photo. I\ndon't know what they look like.\"\n\nCASES PENDING\nWest Bengal has a 21-week deadline for a rescued victim to\nbe sent back home but it is rarely met, state officials said,\ndue to lengthy court cases in India and the time it takes\nBangladesh to confirm that a survivor is one of its citizens.\nThat is due to the high volume of cases, the fact that some\nvictims do not share their home addresses for fear of reprisals\nagainst their families, and because relatives cannot always\nidentify them easily after years apart.\nTo ensure faster returns, India has started sharing photos\nof victims with Bangladeshi officials over the past year, having\npreviously just provided their name, sex and age.\nSitting at her desk, state government anti-trafficking\nconsultant Madhumita Haldar showed two photos of a teenage\nBangladeshi victim on her smartphone. In one she was wearing a\nheadscarf, in the other her face was covered in garish make-up.\n\"But how is a parent supposed to recognise their child from\nthis?\" she asked, surrounded by victim case files stacked high.\nMore than 80% of the 180 female trafficking victims in West\nBengal waiting to go home still have not had their nationality\nverified by Bangladesh and some have been waiting for over a\nyear, Haldar said.\nA Bangladeshi officer who declined to be named said police\nnever took more than six weeks to complete the process, despite\nsome delays in verifying victims' addresses.\nYet in one case, a teenage girl died of acute abdominal pain\nthat shelter officials later linked to her withdrawal from\nalcohol and drugs as she waited for her repatriation order to be\ncompleted by Bangladesh, according to activist Tapoti Bhowmick.\n\"Within a day and a half (of her death), all the paperwork\nwas completed and the clearances were in place,\" said Bhowmick\nfrom Sanlaap, an anti-trafficking charity in West Bengal.\n\"Should these girls die to go back to their country?\"\nPriya's story ends more happily.\nWeeks after speaking to the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the\nteenager returned to Bangladesh, having spent nearly nine years\nin India.\nShe is now in another shelter, being cared for by a charity,\nbut is set to return to her family home in the coming weeks.\n\"It feels really good to finally return,\" Priya said by\nphone from the shelter. \"I have forgotten what my house looks\nlike, but I know that I will be able to recognise once I see it.\n\"I just want to go home and see my family.\"\n(Reporting by Roli Srivastava @Rolionaroll and Naimul Karim;\nWriting by Roli Srivastava; Editing by Kieran Guilbert and\nClaire Cozens.

        "text": "(Reworks and updates with Cate Blanchett quotes)\nBy Emma Batha\nLONDON, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Film star Cate\nBlanchett called on Monday for the world to end the\n\"devastating\" plight of millions of people with no nationality\namid warnings that rising xenophobia is stymieing efforts to\nmeet a 2024 deadline for eradicating statelessness.\nThe double Oscar-winner said statelessness prevented people\nfulfilling their potential, and was a \"heartbreaking\" waste of\nhuman talent.\nBlanchett threw her weight behind the global #Ibelong\ncampaign to end statelessness as she addressed an\nintergovernmental meeting in Geneva aimed at dramatically\nescalating progress.\nHer support will boost attention on an issue that has long\nbeen neglected.\nNot recognised as nationals of any country, stateless people\nare often deprived of basic rights like education and\nhealthcare, and risk exploitation and detention.\nBlanchett held up her own passport, credit card and Medicare\ncard as she urged ministers and government officials to imagine\nhow difficult life would be if they had no documents.\n\"It's a condition of invisibility,\" she said. \"Stateless\npeople are unseen and unheard.\"\nBlanchett, a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. refugee agency\n(UNHCR), interviewed Maha Mamo, a formerly stateless activist\nwho has become a torchbearer for #Ibelong, describing her as an\n\"extraordinary beacon of hope\".\nThe activist, who speaks five languages, told delegates how\nher hopes of studying medicine and joining a Lebanese basketball\nteam were crushed because she had no papers.\nThe Geneva meeting comes halfway through the #Ibelong\ninitiative launched in 2014.\nBut the task ahead is monumental. Only about 200,000 people\nacquired citizenship during the first half of the campaign,\nbarely making a dent in the overall number.\nAnd U.N. officials admit the total may now be even higher\nthan in 2014 because of increasing displacement triggered by\ncrises in Syria, Venezuela and elsewhere, which has raised the\nrisk of many children growing up stateless.\nThere is also no solution in sight for many of the largest\ngroups of stateless people including the Rohingya, hundreds of\nthousands of whom have fled to Bangladesh following an upsurge\nin violence.\nU.N. officials are also keeping a close eye on India, where\n1.9 million people in the northeastern state of Assam have been\nleft off a register of citizens, stoking concerns that many\ncould become stateless.\nUNHCR chief Filippo Grandi said global awareness of the\nrepercussions of statelessness was growing and they had received\nmore than 170 pledges of action ahead of the meeting.\nBut he warned that \"damaging forms of nationalism\" and the\n\"manipulation of anti-refugee and migrant sentiment\" were\nputting progress at risk.\nDOGS HAVE MORE RIGHTS\nPeople end up stateless for a host of reasons including\nmigration, flawed citizenship laws and ethnic discrimination.\nOthers fall through the cracks when countries break up.\nAside from Myanmar, there are big stateless groups in Ivory\nCoast, Thailand, Nepal, Kuwait and some former Soviet countries.\nStateless people have previously told the Thomson Reuters\nFoundation that they feel stigmatised and forgotten.\n\"We've had people telling us, 'dogs are more important than\nI am',\" said Melanie Khanna, head of the UNHCR's statelessness\nsection.\n\"People feel totally scarred and isolated. They often say,\n'I thought it was just me'. It sends chills down your spine.\"\nAlmost all countries are represented at the Geneva meeting,\nwith some 1,000 delegates including a number of ministers. U.N.\nofficials say the pledges will provide a roadmap for\naccelerating the campaign.\nIn July, Kyrgyzstan made history when it became the first\ncountry to officially end statelessness. U.N. officials believe\nTurkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan could also meet the\n2024 deadline.\nThailand, where nearly 479,000 people are stateless,\nincluding members of ethnic hill tribes in the northern border\nregions, is also stepping up action.\nThe issue made international headlines last year during\nrescue efforts to save a young Thai football team trapped in a\nflooded cave.\nDuring the drama it emerged that several of the boys and\ntheir coach were stateless. They were granted citizenship after\ntheir ordeal.\n\nWIN-WIN\nBut resolving statelessness is not just a human rights\nissue. Statelessness has fuelled conflict and displacement in\nboth Myanmar and Ivory Coast.\nKhanna said there was a growing recognition that resolving\nstatelessness was a \"win-win\" because it was in governments'\ninterests to have everybody feel invested in the society they\nlived in and motivated to contribute.\nThe U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of\nglobal pledges on tackling poverty, inequality and other ills\nwith an overall ambition to \"to leave no one behind\", have\nhelped shift attitudes, Khanna said.\n\"The SDGs have allowed us to talk about this whole area as a\ndevelopment issue and not just a human rights one,\" she added.\n\"This makes a lot of sense because you don't want\ndisenfranchised, impoverished people on your territory.\"\nKhanna said an increasing number of countries were changing\ntheir nationality laws and policies to prevent future\ngenerations ending up in limbo.\nColombia, for example, has announced it will give\ncitizenship to thousands of children born to Venezuelan migrants\nto prevent them growing up stateless.\nOther countries have scrapped discriminatory laws that\nprevent women passing their citizenship to their children - a\nmajor cause of statelessness.\nThe impact of such laws has been clearly seen during the\nSyrian war with many displaced mothers unable to obtain\ndocuments for their children where the father is dead or absent.\nIran became the latest country to pass reforms last week.\nThere has also been a flurry of countries joining the U.N.\nconventions on protecting stateless people and preventing\nstatelessness.\nThe 1961 convention stipulates that a state must grant\nnationality to anyone born on its territory who would otherwise\nbe stateless - a safeguard that would wipe out most new cases of\nstatelessness if adopted by all countries.\nBlanchett appealed to all nations to give stateless people\n\"their basic human right to belong\", adding that solutions were\noften straightforward.\n\"It is a man-made problem and it is solvable,\" she said.\n(Reporting by Emma Batha @emmabatha; Editing by Claire Cozens.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

        "text": "By Anuradha Nagaraj\nGUWAHATI, India, Oct 6 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Abanti\nDeka had no idea when she married her husband that taking his\nname would jeopardise her Indian citizenship.\nThat was before authorities in the northeast Indian state of\nAssam, where she has lived all her life, launched a vast and\nhighly contentious exercise to register all its citizens as part\nof a campaign against illegal immigration.\nWhen the register was published at the end of August, the\nnames of nearly 2 million of the state's about 33 million people\nwere missing, plunging them into a bureaucratic nightmare that\nhuman rights experts fear could render some stateless.\nAbanti was one of the unlucky ones.\n\"The notice came suddenly,\" she told the Thomson Reuters\nFoundation at her lawyer's office.\n\"I don't understand. I was born here, I have voted here\nbefore, but suddenly none of that matters any more.\"\nResentment against illegal immigrants has simmered for years\nin Assam, one of India's poorest states, with residents blaming\noutsiders for taking their jobs and land.\nTo be included on the register, residents had to produce\ndocuments proving their families lived in India before March 24,\n1971, when hundreds of thousands of people began fleeing\nconflict across the border in what is now Bangladesh.\nLawyers and campaigners dealing with such cases say they\npresent particular challenges for women.\nAbout one in three women in Assam is illiterate - a higher\nproportion than for men - and many marry young, moving away from\nhome and losing access to any documents that might prove their\norigins.\nThey also take their husbands' names, a move that has\ncomplicated things further for many married women in a region\nwhere family names are markers of ethnic and religious\naffiliation.\n\"The women have had to pay a higher price,\" said Tanya\nLaskar, a lawyer working on such cases.\n\"They have struggled the hardest to get relevant documents\nand many failed because they were child brides or the family did\nnot put their names on a land document because women are not\nentitled to property in many homes.\"\nPRESSURE\nIndia is expected to face pressure at a major\nintergovernmental meeting in Geneva on Monday to assess progress\nin a global decade-long campaign aimed at eradicating\nstatelessness by 2024.\nOn Wednesday, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees\nFilippo Grandi expressed concerns that the Assam exercise could\nresult in some people being made stateless.\nThere are an estimated 10-15 million stateless people\nworldwide who are not recognised as nationals of any country and\nare deprived of basic rights most people take for granted such\nas education and healthcare.\nThose excluded from India's register will have 120 days to\nprove their citizenship at hundreds of regional quasi-judicial\nbodies known as foreigners' tribunals. If that goes against\nthem, they can appeal all the way up to India's Supreme Court.\n'LONELY BATTLES'\nFrom land deeds to school leaving certificates, voter lists\nand birth certificates, residents of Assam have had to spend\nthousands of rupees to access their documents from government\noffices.\nLaskar, who runs awareness campaigns on the process, said\npoorer families often spent their limited resources on the men.\n\"In poor families, a woman's right to justice comes at the\nend,\" she said. \"We have had women fainting in our awareness\nmeetings because they are so worried of what lies ahead. Many\nknow that they will have to fight lonely battles.\"\nEducation is another factor, said Digambar Narzary, head of\nthe Nedan Foundation, a human rights charity that works in a\nremote autonomous region inhabited mostly by tribal people.\n\"In many parts of the state, access to education for girls\nhas been a challenge,\" she said.\n\"Since they haven't been to school or dropped out early,\nthey do not have essential school leaving documents that\nestablish one's age and other details.\"\nState authorities have not provided a breakdown of men and\nwomen omitted from the register. But many married women like\nAbanti say they have been left off even though their siblings\nand parents were included.\nAmong them is Aladi Mondol, 42, the only member of the\nfamily she was born into whose name is not on the citizens'\nregister.\nMondol lost key documents in flooding, common in Assam, and\nsaid she did not realise how important they would become.\n\"I was trying to salvage so many things from the house as\nthe river crept in,\" she said.\n\"I cried when I found out because my brothers and parents\nare on the list. I am a little scared.\"\n\nSURNAMES MATTER\nDebasmita Ghosh, the lawyer representing Abanti at a\nforeigners' tribunal in the state capital Guwahati, said her\nclient had not known that her married name would cause problems.\n\"They are Assamese and she was born here. She didn't realise\nthat the surname mattered,\" Ghosh told the tribunal at a recent\nhearing to which the Thomson Reuters Foundation gained rare\naccess.\n\"In fact, she never mentioned her father's name to us\neither, we found it by chance in an old document she gave us,\"\nsaid Ghosh, who works with the Human Rights Law Network, a\ncollective that provides legal aid.\nThat proved Abanti, who does not know her exact age but is\nin her 40s, was called Deka before she married Adhir Hajong and\ntook his name, which many associate with Bangladesh.\nAbanti said her ordeal had made her feel almost invisible,\nbut knew she had to see it through for her children's sake.\n\"If I am declared a foreigner, it will impact my children.\nThey will not get jobs or benefits from the state,\" she said.\n\"I am not a criminal, but if the tribunal is not convinced\nthat I was born here then I might be in a detention camp and\nthat will be the end of the road for my children as well.\"\n(Reporting by Anuradha Nagaraj @AnuraNagaraj; Editing by Claire\nCozens.

        "text": "By Michael Taylor\nKUALA LUMPUR, Nov 1 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Ten major\ncompanies that sell and use palm oil have teamed up on a new\nradar system to monitor forests across Malaysia and Indonesia\nmore closely and speed up action to stop deforestation, a group\nleading the initiative said on Friday.\nThe coalition of palm oil producers and buyers will\ncontribute nearly $1.3 million to the project - led by the\nU.S.-based World Resources Institute (WRI) - which will keep a\nwatch on forests using data from European Space Agency\nsatellites.\n\"The new technology on one side and the fact that we have\nall of these big actors in the room coming together to think\nabout how we can best use the information ... is really what\nneeds to happen,\" said Anne Rosenbarger, Southeast Asia\ncommodities manager at WRI in Indonesia.\nPalm oil, the world's most widely used edible oil, is found\nin everything from margarine to biscuits, and soap to soups.\nBut the $60-billion global trade has faced scrutiny in\nrecent years from green activists and consumers, who have blamed\nits production for forest loss, fires and worker exploitation.\nThe world's top two producers and exporters are Indonesia\nand Malaysia, and the new radar-based system will cover both.\nWRI said it would be up and running within two years and could\neventually be expanded into other grower countries.\nThe system will use higher resolution images than existing\nmonitoring initiatives, cover a wider area and penetrate cloud\ncover. Its data will also be made publicly available through\nonline monitoring service Global Forest Watch.\nRosenbarger told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the ability\nto gather 10 major market players to work with the new platform\n\"has a lot of potential for impact\".\n\"The main thing was how we can get more reliable information\nquicker to help have faster follow-up on the ground so we can\nintervene where deforestation is happening,\" she added.\nThe online platform will highlight patches in concessions\nand protected areas suffering tree loss and deforestation.\nAs well as alerting companies to where action is needed,\ngovernments and conservation groups can also use the information\nto hold businesses linked to those areas accountable.\nThe palm oil and consumer goods firms in the project - which\nare already receiving alerts and giving feedback - are Bunge,\nCargill, Golden Agri-Resources, Mondelez, Musim Mas Group,\nNestle, PepsiCo, Sime Darby Plantation, Unilever and Wilmar.\nMany high-profile palm oil buyers have committed to zero\ndeforestation and to source only sustainable oil by 2020,\nalthough some are likely to miss their targets.\n\"We are committed to developing a range of technologies that\nwill enhance and accelerate our efforts to address potential\nissues within our supply chain,\" Petra Meekers, head of\nsustainable sourcing at Unilever, said in a statement. \"Better\nradar monitoring is an essential piece of this puzzle.\"\n(Reporting by Michael Taylor @MickSTaylor; editing by Megan\nRowling.

        "text": "By Michael Taylor\nKUALA LUMPUR, Oct 31 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The\namount of planet-warming carbon emitted by the world's lost\ntropical forests has been under-reported as estimates failed to\ntake into account the longer-term effects of tree destruction,\nresearchers said.\nA new international study re-evaluated the carbon impacts of\nforests that were destroyed or degraded between 2000 and 2013,\nadding up to 49 million hectares (121 million acres), roughly\nthe size of Spain.\nThe carbon released from losses to those \"intact forests\"\nwill amount to more than six times previous estimates when\nadditional emissions caused by changes to the forest up to 2050\nare included, it found.\nIntact forests are large areas of continuous forest with no\nsigns of intensive human activity, like agriculture or logging.\n\"Once you've caused the initial round of damage, you have\ncommitted to a lot of further emissions in the future once the\nforest has opened up,\" said study co-author Tom Evans of the New\nYork-based Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS).\n\"It's a bit like if you're injured at work you have lost\nearnings for years into the future,\" he told the Thomson Reuters\nFoundation. \"Those carbon lost earnings turn out to be the\nbiggest part of the picture for these intact forests.\"\nTrees suck carbon dioxide from the air, and store carbon,\nthe main greenhouse gas heating up the Earth's climate. But they\nrelease it when they are cut down and are burned or rot.\nEnvironmentalists say protecting existing forests and\nrestoring damaged ones prevents flooding, limits climate change\nand protects biodiversity.\nThe tropics lost 12 million hectares of tree cover in 2018,\nthe fourth-highest annual loss since records began in 2001,\naccording to forest monitoring service Global Forest Watch.\nOf greatest concern, it said, was the disappearance of 3.6\nmillion hectares of old-growth rainforest, an area the size of\nBelgium, much due to fires, land-clearing for farms and mining.\nAreas analysed in the new study, published in the journal\nScience Advances, included intact forests lost in the Amazon and\nCongo basins and on Southeast Asia's islands.\nWhile previous research largely focused on stored carbon\nlosses directly linked to deforestation, the new study also took\ninto account the knock-on and future effects.\nThose include indiscriminate logging around newly opened up\nforest areas as they become more accessible and a rise in\nhunting that limits the spread of seeds and hinders forest\nregeneration.\nOver time, the carbon-storing abilities of the new forest\nedges created by deforestation also decline as human and grazing\nactivities increase and temperatures change.\n\"Once you open up a forest, there are several forms of\ndamage that lead to that dwindling of carbon stocks,\" said\nEvans, adding that undamaged forests also become more\ncarbon-rich each year.\nThese effects tend to get overlooked in carbon accounting\nused to work out how and where to target conservation incentives\nand provide payments for preventing forest loss, he added.\nIn 2013, the world had about 549 million hectares of intact\ntropical forests left, the study said.\nEnsuring their future should now be a priority, with\nincreased efforts and policies to keep them safe, Evans said.\nThat should include better recognition of indigenous land\nrights and a halt to the expansion of mining, fossil fuel\nextraction, agriculture and infrastructure which often drives\nforest loss, he added.\n\"Our results revealed that continued destruction of intact\ntropical forests is a ticking time bomb for carbon emissions,\"\nthe study's lead author Sean Maxwell, a scientist with\nAustralia's University of Queensland, said in a statement.\n\"There is an urgent need to safeguard these landscapes\nbecause they play an indispensable role in stabilising the\nclimate.\"\n(Reporting by Michael Taylor @MickSTaylor; editing by Megan\nRowling.

        "text": "By Beh Lih Yi\nLEMBAR, Indonesia, Oct 31 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -\nF ifteen minutes into their first date, Indonesian teenager Helma\nYani received a marriage proposal from a boy she had just met.\nHe spirited her away to a relative's house and a month later, at\nage 17, they were married.\nYani is one of nearly 1.5 million child brides in\nMuslim-majority Indonesia, which has the world's eighth-highest\nnumber of underage unions according to the United Nations.\nThe government raised the marriage age for girls from 16 to\n19 in September, but rights groups fear deep-rooted traditions\nand the practice of not registering unions could hamper efforts\nto end the scourge.\nOn Yani's island of Lombok, the Sasak people continue a\ncenturies-old tradition of \"bride kidnapping\", in which a woman\nis taken away by her future husband before a wedding.\nKnown locally as \"merariq\", Sasak elders say the kidnapping\nis part of an elaborate courtship ritual requiring consent from\nboth parents, but is now widely abused to justify early\nmarriages.\n\"I didn't know what to do when he proposed so I said yes,\"\nsaid Yani, looking away shyly as she spoke in her village where\nchildren and chickens roam the streets. \"We rode off on a\nmotorbike from the beach to his relative's house.\"\nHer parents did not know where she was for days until the\nvillage heads came to say that Yani had been taken by the boy\nand was preparing for marriage.\n\"I was angry and upset, I cried non-stop as I tried to\nsearch for her,\" said her mother Nur Halima as she cradled\nYani's two-month-old baby girl.\n\"She had not finished school, but what can I do except let\nher get married? If she returns unmarried she could bring shame\non our family,\" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nStories like Yani's are common across Lombok, but activists\nare fighting back with an unusual approach of joining forces\nwith village elders to restore the traditional ways of\n\"merariq\".\n\nMARRIAGES GO UNREGISTERED\nGlobally 12 million girls become child brides each year,\naccording to campaign group Girls Not Brides. They face greater\nrisks of exploitation, sexual violence, domestic abuse and death\nin childbirth.\nIn Indonesia, a Southeast Asian archipelago of 260 million,\npoverty and tradition lead to one in nine girls being married\nbefore age 18, according to official statistics.\nAnd the West Nusa Tenggara province, which includes Lombok,\nranks among Indonesia's top 10 for child marriage.\nLombok's bride kidnapping ritual dates back generations\namong the Sasak, an ethnic Muslim group of about 3 million who\nmostly live on the island east of the resort destination Bali.\nAt one time, negotiations were held between families after a\nSasak man set his sights on a woman, in contrast to bride\nkidnappings plaguing countries like Kyrgyzstan, Mali and\nEthiopia.\nThe man would then take the woman to an agreed location to\nsee if they were compatible, as relatives supervised.\nNow the ritual often results in sad tales like Yani's \u2013 an\neasy excuse for men to force marriage on young vulnerable women.\nOnce a girl is with a suitor for days, parents are typically so\ndesperate to avoid social stigma they agree to the union.\nIn Lombok, which sends one of the highest numbers of\nIndonesians overseas as migrant workers, some parents feel their\ndaughters can be better looked after in their absence if they\nmarry. It also alleviates a financial burden.\n\"It is done in the name of tradition, so people just accept\nit blindly regardless if it is right or wrong,\" said Faozan, of\nthe local non-profit Village Children Protection Group.\nFaozan, who like many Indonesians uses one name, said\nrampant underage marriage on Lombok has been linked to social\nills ranging from divorce to unplanned pregnancies, maternal\ndeaths and stunting among children.\nIn addition, Islamic ceremonies are common. Islamic law\npermits such unions but because they are not formally registered\nwomen are often denied their rights and maintenance payments in\nthe case of divorce.\nYani, who was married under Islamic law and divorced by her\nhusband a month before she gave birth, is struggling to get her\nbaby a birth certificate as her marriage was never formally\nregistered.\nIndonesia's Women Empowerment and Child Protection Ministry\nsaid in a recent statement that it planned to raise awareness\nthrough education among children, parents and religious leaders\nto end child marriage.\nIt did not reply to a request for comment.\nThe government has stated that raising the age of marriage\nwould save children from underage unions.\nThe change came after Indonesia's top court last year ruled\nin favour of a petition by women's rights groups who argued the\nrule discriminated against girls, who could marry at 16 while\nthe legal age for men is 19.\nBut the new law permits exceptions if parents ask the court\nfor permission, raising concerns that young women could still be\nforced to marry in large numbers.\nWEAVING AND BUFFALO\nWearing a traditional Muslim \"songkok\" prayer cap and a\nbatik shirt, Sasak elder Muhamad Rais is among senior figures\nwho advise local people on traditional customs in matters like\nbirth, marriage and death.\nSince 2016 he has worked with local charities under a pilot\nproject to revive the original \"merariq\" traditions, which he\nsaid are governed by a set of complicated steps that must be\ncarefully followed before the \"kidnapping ritual\" takes place.\n\"I am sad, embarrassed and angry,\" Rais told the Thomson\nReuters Foundation in a bamboo hut where he regularly dispenses\nadvice to villagers.\n\"Our tradition has been abused by our own people. The\nvictims are our girls and women,\" said Rais, 54.\nKey to his work is re-introducing an element known as\n\"belas\" to the rituals, which allows the girl and boy to be\nseparated if they are deemed not yet fit for marriage.\nAnd while traditional \"merariq\" customs do not stipulate a\nminimum age, Rais said the woman must have weaved 144 pieces of\ncloth and the man must have reared buffalo which have produced\n25 offspring before they can wed.\nIn other words, they must be adults.\nThe pilot project, in place in four villages since 2016, has\nstopped some 20 underage unions according to Lombok-based\ncharity Child and Youth Protection Institution, which is\nspearheading the initiative.\n\"We can't blame the tradition, because it's the deviation\nfrom its original practice that led to all these issues,\" said\nspokeswoman Baiq Zulhiatina.\n\"What we are trying to do is to change the mindset of our\npeople and tell them stopping child marriage is not shameful.\"\n(Reporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi; Editing by Chris Michaud.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

MAYA BAY, THAILAND: The island cove was made famous by\nthe 2000 film \"The Beach\" starring Leonardo DiCaprio. It was\nclosed to tourists last year until 2021 in a bid to salvage the\narea's coral reefs, which have been damaged by warmer\ntemperatures and a flood of tourists.\n\n2. BORACAY ISLAND, THE PHILIPPINES: The resort was closed\nfor a six-month cleanup from April to October 2018 after being\ndescribed as a \"cesspool\" by President Rodrigo Duterte. The\nisland attracted 2 million visitors the previous year but has\nnow limited numbers to 19,000 per day and banned beach parties,\nsmoking and drinking.\n\n3. MOUNT EVEREST BASE CAMP, CHINA: The Chinese government\nclosed its side of the Everest base camp this year to anyone\nwithout a climbing permit due to the huge amounts of rubbish\npiling up at the site, according to the Lonely Planet travel\nwebsite. The Chinese base camp, located in Tibet, was accessible\nby car.\n\n4. FJADRARGLJUFUR CANYON, ICELAND: The popular site, which\nfeatured in one of Justin Bieber's music videos, was closed to\ntourists for about three months this year due to damage from wet\nweather and foot traffic. The number of visitors had nearly\ndoubled after being featured in the pop singer's \"I'll Show You\"\nvideo.\n\n5. THE FAROE ISLANDS, DENAMRK: Ten popular tourists sites\nwere closed temporarily this year for maintenance by an\ninternational team of volunteers after a 10% growth in visitor\nnumbers in recent years.\n\n6. SIPADAN ISLAND, MALAYSIA: One of the world's most\nrenowned scuba diving spots on Malaysia's part of Borneo island\nwill be shut for a month every December from 2020 to allow the\ncoral and marine ecosystem to recuperate.\n\n7. KOMODO ISLAND, INDONESIA: Authorities are due to limit\nvisitor numbers and raise entry prices to the island in order to\nconserve the population of the Komodo dragons, the world's\nlargest living species of lizard. Officials initially planned to\nclose the island for one year from 2020 but later scrapped the\nidea.\n\n8. SPANISH STEPS, ITALY: Rome banned tourists from sitting\non the famous monument in August, in a crackdown on overcrowding\nby tourists. Visitors can still walk up and down, but offenders\nof the sitting ban can be fined up to 400 euros ($444).\nThe site was largely shut between October 2015 and September\n2016 for a private restoration after the 135 steps had become\nloose, stained and cracked under the strain of daily use by both\nresidents and visitors.\n\nSource: Thomson Reuters Foundation, Reuters, New Straits\nTimes, Lonely Planet\n($1 = 0.9001 euros)\n(Writing by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi; Editing by Michael Taylor.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

They should be a part of urban planning,\"\nSutanudjaja told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nResidents, many of whom have lived there for generations,\nhave valuable knowledge of disaster preparedness, flood\nmitigation and other risks linked to climate change, she said.\n\"Kampungs are living spaces with problems with sanitation\nand housing that reduce their resilience, so we also don't want\nto romanticise them. But demolition is not an answer,\" she said.\nThere is also risk attached to success: George Town on\nPenang island, off Malaysia's west coast, is a UNESCO world\nheritage site that is hugely popular with tourists that many\nresidents blame for congestion and higher rents.\nUnder-pressure cities need a conservation approach when\nmodernising, which includes residents to keeps alive traditional\nknowledge and cultures such as foods, clothing and music, said\nSaswat Bandyopadhyay, an urban planning professor at CEPT\nUniversity in Ahmedabad, India.\n\"The loss of heritage is irreversible - once it's gone, it's\ngone. So we must be doing everything we can to preserve it.\"\n(Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Michael\nTaylor.

He flies by private\njet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night\nat a Macau casino.\nTse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected\nof leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate\nformed out of an alliance of five of Asia\u2019s triad groups,\naccording to law enforcement officials. Its members call it\nsimply \u201cThe Company.\u201d Police, in a nod to one of Tse\u2019s\nnicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for \u201cBrother Number\nThree.\u201d\nThe syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of\nmethamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen\ncountries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South\nPacific. But meth \u2013 a highly addictive drug with devastating\nphysical and mental effects on long-term users \u2013 is its main\nbusiness, they say.\nIn what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations\nOffice on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s\nmeth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be\nas high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the\ncartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a\n40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has\nexpanded at least fourfold in the past five years.\nThis unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an\nunprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the\nprime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously\nunreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the\nAustralian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about\n20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far\nthe biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug\ntrafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in\nthe investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar,\nChina, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan,\nwhile not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the\ninvestigation.\nA document containing AFP profiles of the operation\u2019s top 19\nsyndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the\nleader of the syndicate. According to the document, the\norganization has \u201cbeen connected with or directly involved in at\nleast 13 cases\u201d of drug trafficking since January 2015. The\ndocument does not provide specific details of the cases.\nA Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the\n\u201cMultinational CEO\u201d of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement\nAdministration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional\ngovernment agencies says Tse is \u201cbelieved to be\u201d the leader of\nthe Sam Gor syndicate.\nPolice have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected\nboss of the trafficking group.\nSome investigators say that the scope of the syndicate\u2019s\noperation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin\nAmerica\u2019s most legendary narco-traffickers. \u201cTse Chi Lop is in\nthe league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,\u201d said Jeremy\nDouglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC.\n\u201cThe word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no\ndoubt it applies here.\u201d\nReuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to\nquestions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan\u2019s Ministry\nof Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on\ninvestigations.\nDuring the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific\nto uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This\nincluded interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement\nofficials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence\nreports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings\nand other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in\nMyanmar\u2019s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia\u2019s Golden\nTriangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing\ndrugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited\nthe Thai compound of one of the syndicate\u2019s alleged drug lords.\nWhat emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly\ntransnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the\nAFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often\nrefer to as \u201cT1\u201d - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong,\nMacau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.\nThe syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and\nsophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin\nAmerican cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies\na bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a\nmore diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels\ndo, including Japan\u2019s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic\nChinese gangs across Southeast Asia.\nThe crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled\noutbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police\nsay. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked\nrivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a\nunited pursuit of gargantuan profits.\n\u201cThe crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate\nwith seamless efficiency,\u201d says one veteran Western anti-drugs\nofficial. \u201cThey function like a global corporation.\u201d\nLike most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed,\nthe investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.\nIn addition to the contrasts between their drug operations,\nthere\u2019s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop\nand Joaquin \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed\nMexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine\ntrafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their\nextravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has\nbeen revealed about Tse\u2019s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug\nlords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.\n\nA TRIP, A TRAP\nTse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern\nChina, and grew up during China\u2019s Cultural Revolution. Amid the\nbloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group\nof imprisoned members of Mao\u2019s Red Guard in the southern city of\nGuangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big\nCircle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police,\nand like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong\nKong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their\ncriminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.\nIn the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong,\nMacau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based\nin Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling\nring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless\nopium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand,\nChina and Laos meet.\nIn 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on\ndrug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New\nYork. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into\nAmerica, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over\nhis head.\nThrough a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged\nfor leniency.\nHis ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His\n12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed.\nIf freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed\n\u201cgreat sorrow\u201d for his crime, court records show.\nThe entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to\nnine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional\ninstitution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.\nAfter he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to\nCanada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for\nthe next four years. It\u2019s unclear when Tse returned to his old\nhaunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife\nregistered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company\nLtd, in Hong Kong in 2011.\nPolice suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He\n\u201cpicked up where he left off,\u201d said the senior AFP investigator.\nTse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and\nthe Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved\nirresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his\ndrug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no\nextra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.\nHis policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for\nbusiness, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011,\nAFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and\nmeth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather\nthan arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under\nsurveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely\nfor more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug\ncell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They\nwanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.\nThe syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other\ndrug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and\nselling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the\nsyndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the\nMelbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police\nwatched the Australian meet two men.\nOne of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted\nhair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese\nfamily man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance\nshowed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal\nsecurity. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of\nThai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eight\nworked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as\npart of his security protocol.\nTse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts\nand five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in\nprivate jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand\nfor a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt,\naccording to a member of the task force investigating the\nsyndicate.\nTse was a frequent visitor to Asia\u2019s casinos and fond of\nbetting on horses, especially on English races. \u201cWe believe he\nlost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the\ntables in Macau,\u201d said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.\nAs the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected\nthat the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia\nwith meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA,\ncommonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the\nSam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say,\nwhen a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of\nwhite powder strapped to each of his thighs.\n\n\u2018ALADDIN\u2019S CAVE OF INTEL\u2019\nCai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the\nairport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It\nwas the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous,\npicking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said\na former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation.\n\u201cHis hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,\u201d the\ncommander told Reuters. \u201cMethamphetamine is very toxic.\u201d\nCai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs\nwas a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful\ntranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. \u201cWe were very\nfortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,\u201d the\ncommander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been\nmonitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police\nhad no idea who he was.\nCai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a\n\u201cpesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,\u201d according to\nMyanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A\nfriend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father.\nCai\u2019s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for\nketamine at the airport, the commander said.\nUnimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight.\nThe next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport.\nOne recognized him from surveillance work he\u2019d been conducting.\nStill, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they\nlater found on one of his phones might have explained his\nsilence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least\nthree assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch\nand electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said\none investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy\nsaying \u201cLoyalty to the Heavens.\u201d The banner was a \u201ctriad-related\nsign,\u201d he added.\nThe tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed\nthe video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat\nbecause he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a\nlaw enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of\nthe victim\u2019s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad\nmembers were sending a message about the price of disloyalty,\nthe officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.\nThe torture videos were just one of the items allegedly\nfound in Cai\u2019s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was\na diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate\u2019s activities, but\nsloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones,\npolice say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media\nconversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.\nThey were \u201can Aladdin\u2019s Cave of intel,\u201d said one AFP\ncommander based in North Asia.\nFor at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly\ntravelled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for\nthe syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the\nDrug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its\ninvestigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip\nfrom an international courier company recording the delivery of\ntwo consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf\nChinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea\npackets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had\nbeen cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.\nTwo days after Cai\u2019s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon\naddress, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That\nevening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon\njetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so,\nMyanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but\nother than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate,\nincluding couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.\nThen came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery\nof photos and videos on Cai\u2019s phones, an AFP investigator based\nin Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing\nhe had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier.\n\u201cThis one stuck out because it was Canadian,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI\nsaid: \u2018Fuck, I know who you are!'\u201d\nIt was Tse Chi Lop.\nThe Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of\nintelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work\non Cai\u2019s phones.\nAustralia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime\ngangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade,\nthe AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and\nsmall, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent\ndescribed the database, which includes a trove of names,\nchemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and\nsurveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence\non Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.\nThe AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai\u2019s\nphones with the database. They discovered photos related to\nthree big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in\nChina, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators\nand Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese\nanti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and\naddresses in Cai\u2019s phones to other meth busts in China.\nFor regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations\nupended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by\ndifferent crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the\nwork of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics\nagent said they believed Cai was \u201cone of the members of a\nmega-syndicate,\u201d which had been involved in multiple \u201cdrugs\ncases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.\u201d\nCai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still\nin jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking\ncharges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to\ncontact Cai\u2019s lawyer.\n\nMETH PARADISE\nDuring his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing\nthe country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and\nobtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a\nbigger vessel in international waters, according to police and\nthe Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures\nof the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where\nthe meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.\nThe police reconstruction of Cai\u2019s dealings in Myanmar led\nto another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production\nhad shifted from China\u2019s southern provinces to Shan State in\nMyanmar\u2019s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had\nprovided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor\ningredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were\nsmuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in\nthe Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the\nfreedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.\nArmed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan\nState have long controlled large tracts of territory and used\ndrug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the\nmilitary. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar\ngovernment with rebel groups over the years has brought relative\ncalm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to\nflourish.\n\u201cProduction facilities can be hidden from law enforcement\nand other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,\u201d\nanalyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the\nInternational Crisis Group. \u201cDrug production and profits are now\nso vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.\u201d\nThe Myanmar government and police did not respond to\nquestions from Reuters.\nAlong the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there\nis evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts\na deep ravine known as the \u201cValley of Death,\u201d where ethnic\nKachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for\ndecades with Myanmar\u2019s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past\ntrucks carrying building materials and workers.\nThe Kaung Kha militia\u2019s immaculate and expansive new\nheadquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green\nhills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers\naway, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved\nout of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned\nout vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba\ntablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine.\nWhen it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more\nthan 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg\nof caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances\nused in drug production.\nThe Loikan facility was \u201cvery likely\u201d to have been the\nsource of much of the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s meth, said the\nYangon-based AFP officer.\n\u201cSome militia were involved in the lab,\u201d said Oi Khun, a\ncommunications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia,\nin an interview. He paused, then added: \u201cBut not with the\nknowledge of senior members\u201d of the militia.\nOne person in Loikan described how workers from the lab\nwould come down from the hills. The men, like most of the\nvillagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the\nlocals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.\n\u201cI asked them once. \u2018Why don\u2019t you bathe?\u2019\u201d the person said.\n\u201cThey said they did, but there was nothing they could do about\nthe smell.\u201d\nThe rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the\nskin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature\nstench might reveal their illicit activities. \u201cWe all knew,\u201d the\nperson said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t talk about it. That just brings you\ndanger.\u201d\nMeth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals,\nsay Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network\u2019s\ncouriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the\nAsia-Pacific.\nShan\u2019s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the\nworld, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told\nReuters. \u201cThey can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the\nground and let it dry.\u201d\nThe UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth\nis worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business\nmodel for meth is \u201cvery different\u201d to heroin, said the UNODC\u2019s\nDouglas. \u201cInputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not\nneeded, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore\nfar, far higher.\u201d\nThe wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in\nnortheastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a\nUNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control\nCommission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to\nthe UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand,\n$298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the\nJapanese market, that\u2019s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.\nThe money the syndicate is making \u201cmeans that if they lose\nten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,\u201d\nsaid the Chinese counter-narcotics official. \u201cThey can afford\nfailure. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u2018MONEY, MONEY\u2019\nThe analysis of Cai\u2019s phones was continuing to provide\nleads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the\npick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with\nMyanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at\nsea for weeks.\nOne of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the\nShun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement\ndocument reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea\nwhen, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a\nmarine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and\npaid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV\nValkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s\nand hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea\nsickness tablets. According to local media, he didn\u2019t have a\nfishing license at the time.\nAfter buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on\na course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in\nthe Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the\nrendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western\nAustralian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was\nseen \u201cunloading a lot of packages\u201d into a van, the commander\nsaid.\n\u201cWe knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of\norganized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and\ncomes back with some gear on it, that it hasn\u2019t just dropped\nfrom the sky in the middle of the ocean.\u201d\nInvestigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car\nhire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug\ntraffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say,\nthat some of Smith\u2019s alleged co-conspirators were members of an\nethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and\nComanchero motorcycle gangs, known as \u201cbikies\u201d in Australia.\nAs they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of\ncrystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor\nsyndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy\nof an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians\nreconvened in Perth a month later.\nBikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and\na self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had\nrefined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star\nhotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police\ninvestigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants,\nsaid the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth.\nThe restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that\nincluded caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.\nOn November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again,\nthis time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the\nAndaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth\nfrom Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast\nof the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the\nIndian Ocean.\nThe Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.\nWhen the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in\ninternational waters off the West Australian coast on December\n19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting \u201cmoney, money,\u201d\naccording to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De\nMan\u2019s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith\nand his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved\ntheir identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by\nthe crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.\nThe Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of\nGeraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The\nmen unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of\nthe AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault\nweapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty\nto importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of\nhis alleged associates are still on trial.\nTaiwan\u2019s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it\nhad \u201cworked together with our counterparts on the investigation\u201d\nof the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the \u201csubstantial\nseizure of illicit narcotics\u201d by the Australian authorities in\nDecember 2017. The bureau said it was \u201caware that Taiwanese\nsyndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in\n(the) Asia-Pacific region,\u201d and was working \u201ccollaboratively and\nclosely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and\ncross-border drug trafficking.\u201d\n\nNIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED\nAs the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police\nconcluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone\na kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the\nthree biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the\n1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The\nother two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse\u2019s original triad, and the\nBamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator,\nthe syndicate\u2019s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that\nit \u201cmust rival Apple\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cThe syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market\nto tap,\u201d said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior\ncolonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade.\n\u201cThe power this network possesses is unimaginable.\u201d\nInvestigators have had wins. In February last year, police\nbusted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough\ntea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66\nwas intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than\none tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor\nlieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar.\nIn December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected\nsyndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.\nLocated near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed\ncompound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used\nto experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a\n100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to\nthe back of the property.\nSue wasn\u2019t there, but property and money from 38 bank\naccounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized\nduring the investigation. Sue is still at large.\nBut the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the\nwider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal\nmeth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and\nSoutheast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in\nmost countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising\nseizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019,\n\u201csuggested the supply of the drug had expanded.\u201d\nIn the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive\nadversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug\nmotherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product\nin shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth\ncoming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the\nsyndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This\nincluded deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each\ncontaining about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on\nnarrow jungle paths.\nOver the years, police have had little success in taking\ndown Asia\u2019s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders\nhave been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to\nthe AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics\nkingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than\na short period was in the mid-1970s. That\u2019s when Ng Sik-ho, a\nwily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced\nto 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium\nand morphine, according to court records.\nSo far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho\u2019s fate. He is being\ntracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say\ncounter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they\nbelieve he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.\n(Reporting by Tom Allard. Additional reporting by Reuters\nStaff. Editing by Peter Hirschberg.)",

        "text": "By Tom Allard\nBANGKOK (Reuters) - He is Asia\u2019s most-wanted man. He is protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private jet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night at a Macau casino.\nTse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected of leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate formed out of an alliance of five of Asia\u2019s triad groups, according to law enforcement officials. Its members call it simply \u201cThe Company.\u201d Police, in a nod to one of Tse\u2019s nicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for \u201cBrother Number Three.\u201d\nThe syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of methamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen countries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South Pacific. But meth \u2013 a highly addictive drug with devastating physical and mental effects on long-term users \u2013 is its main business, they say.\nIn what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s meth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be as high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the cartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a 40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has expanded at least fourfold in the past five years.\nThis unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an unprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the prime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously unreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the Australian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about 20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far the biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug trafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in the investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar, China, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan, while not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the investigation.\nA document containing AFP profiles of the operation\u2019s top 19 syndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the leader of the syndicate. According to the document, the organization has \u201cbeen connected with or directly involved in at least 13 cases\u201d of drug trafficking since January 2015. The document does not provide specific details of the cases.\nA Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the \u201cMultinational CEO\u201d of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional government agencies says Tse is \u201cbelieved to be\u201d the leader of the Sam Gor syndicate.\nPolice have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected boss of the trafficking group.\nSome investigators say that the scope of the syndicate\u2019s operation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin America\u2019s most legendary narco-traffickers. \u201cTse Chi Lop is in the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,\u201d said Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC. \u201cThe word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no doubt it applies here.\u201d\nReuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to questions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on investigations.\nDuring the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific to uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This included interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement officials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence reports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings and other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in Myanmar\u2019s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia\u2019s Golden Triangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing drugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited the Thai compound of one of the syndicate\u2019s alleged drug lords.\nWhat emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly transnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the AFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often refer to as \u201cT1\u201d - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.\nThe syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and sophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin American cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies a bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a more diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels do, including Japan\u2019s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic Chinese gangs across Southeast Asia.\nThe crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled outbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police say. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked rivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a united pursuit of gargantuan profits.\n\u201cThe crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate with seamless efficiency,\u201d says one veteran Western anti-drugs official. \u201cThey function like a global corporation.\u201d\nLike most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed, the investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.\nIn addition to the contrasts between their drug operations, there\u2019s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop and Joaquin \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed Mexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine trafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their extravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has been revealed about Tse\u2019s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug lords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.\n\nA TRIP, A TRAP\nTse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern China, and grew up during China\u2019s Cultural Revolution. Amid the bloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group of imprisoned members of Mao\u2019s Red Guard in the southern city of Guangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big Circle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police, and like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong Kong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their criminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.\nIn the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong, Macau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based in Asia. He rose to become a\u00a0mid-ranking member of a smuggling ring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless opium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand, China and Laos meet.\nIn 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on drug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New York. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into America, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over his head.\nThrough a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged for leniency.\nHis ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His 12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed. If freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed \u201cgreat sorrow\u201d for his crime, court records show.\nThe entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to nine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional institution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.\nAfter he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to Canada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for the next four years. It\u2019s unclear when Tse returned to his old haunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife registered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company Ltd, in Hong Kong in 2011.\nPolice suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He \u201cpicked up where he left off,\u201d said the senior AFP investigator. Tse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and the Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved irresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his drug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no extra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.\nHis policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for business, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011, AFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and meth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather than arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under surveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely for more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug cell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They wanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.\nThe syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other drug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and selling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the syndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the Melbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police watched the Australian meet two men.\nOne of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted hair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese family man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance showed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal security. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators.\u00a0Up to eight worked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as part of his security protocol.\nTse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts and five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in private jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand for a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt, according to a member of the task force investigating the syndicate.\nTse was a frequent visitor to Asia\u2019s casinos and fond of betting on horses, especially on English races. \u201cWe believe he lost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the tables in Macau,\u201d said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.\nAs the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected that the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia with meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the Sam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say, when a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of white powder strapped to each of his thighs.\n\n\u2018ALADDIN\u2019S CAVE OF INTEL\u2019\nCai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the airport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It was the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous, picking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said a former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation. \u201cHis hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,\u201d the commander told Reuters. \u201cMethamphetamine is very toxic.\u201d\nCai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs was a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful tranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. \u201cWe were very fortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,\u201d the commander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been monitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police had no idea who he was.\nCai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a \u201cpesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,\u201d according to Myanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A friend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father. Cai\u2019s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for ketamine at the airport, the commander said.\nUnimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight. The next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport. One recognized him from surveillance work he\u2019d been conducting.\nStill, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they later found on one of his phones might have explained his silence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least three assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch and electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said one investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy saying \u201cLoyalty to the Heavens.\u201d The banner was a \u201ctriad-related sign,\u201d he added.\nThe tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed the video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat because he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a law enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of the victim\u2019s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad members were sending a message about the price of disloyalty, the officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.\nThe torture videos were just one of the items allegedly found in Cai\u2019s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was a diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate\u2019s activities, but sloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones, police say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media conversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.\nThey were \u201can Aladdin\u2019s Cave of intel,\u201d said one AFP commander based in North Asia.\nFor at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly traveled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for the syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the Drug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its investigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip from an international courier company recording the delivery of two consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf Chinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea packets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had been cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.\nTwo days after Cai\u2019s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon address, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That evening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon jetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so, Myanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but other than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate, including couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.\nThen came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery of photos and videos on Cai\u2019s phones,\u00a0an AFP investigator based in Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing he had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier. \u201cThis one stuck out because it was Canadian,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI said: \u2018Fuck, I know who you are!'\u201d\nIt was Tse Chi Lop.\nThe Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of intelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work on Cai\u2019s phones.\nAustralia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime gangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade, the AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and small, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent described the database, which includes a trove of names, chemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and surveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence on Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.\nThe AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai\u2019s phones with the database. They discovered photos related to three big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in China, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators and Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese anti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and addresses in Cai\u2019s phones to other meth busts in China.\nFor regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations upended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by different crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the work of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics agent said they believed Cai was \u201cone of the members of a mega-syndicate,\u201d which had been involved in multiple \u201cdrugs cases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.\u201d\nCai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still in jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking charges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to contact Cai\u2019s lawyer.\n\nMETH PARADISE\nDuring his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing the country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and obtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a bigger vessel in international waters, according to police and the Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures of the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where the meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.\nThe police reconstruction of Cai\u2019s dealings in Myanmar led to another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production had shifted from China\u2019s southern provinces to Shan State in Myanmar\u2019s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had provided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor ingredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were smuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the freedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.\nArmed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan State have long controlled large tracts of territory and used drug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the military. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar government with rebel groups over the years has brought relative calm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to flourish.\n\u201cProduction facilities can be hidden from law enforcement and other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,\u201d analyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the International Crisis Group. \u201cDrug production and profits are now so vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.\u201d\nThe Myanmar government and police did not respond to questions from Reuters.\nAlong the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there is evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts a deep ravine known as the \u201cValley of Death,\u201d where ethnic Kachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for decades with Myanmar\u2019s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past trucks carrying building materials and workers.\nThe Kaung Kha militia\u2019s immaculate and expansive new headquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green hills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers away, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved out of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned out vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba tablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine. When it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more than 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg of caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances used in drug production.\nThe Loikan facility was \u201cvery likely\u201d to have been the source of much of the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s meth, said the Yangon-based AFP officer.\n\u201cSome militia were involved in the lab,\u201d said Oi Khun, a communications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia, in an interview. He paused, then added: \u201cBut not with the knowledge of senior members\u201d of the militia.\nOne person in Loikan described how workers from the lab would come down from the hills. The men, like most of the villagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the locals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.\n\u201cI asked them once. \u2018Why don\u2019t you bathe?\u2019\u201d the person said. \u201cThey said they did, but there was nothing they could do about the smell.\u201d\nThe rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the skin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature stench might reveal their illicit activities. \u201cWe all knew,\u201d the person said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t talk about it. That just brings you danger.\u201d\nMeth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals, say Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network\u2019s couriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the Asia-Pacific.\nShan\u2019s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the world, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told Reuters. \u201cThey can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the ground and let it dry.\u201d\nThe UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth is worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business model for meth is \u201cvery different\u201d to heroin, said the UNODC\u2019s Douglas. \u201cInputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not needed, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore far, far higher.\u201d\nThe wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in northeastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a UNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control Commission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to the UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand, $298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the Japanese market, that\u2019s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.\nThe money the syndicate is making \u201cmeans that if they lose ten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,\u201d said the Chinese counter-narcotics official. \u201cThey can afford failure. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u2018MONEY, MONEY\u2019\nThe analysis of Cai\u2019s phones was continuing to provide leads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the pick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with Myanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at sea for weeks.\nOne of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the Shun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement document reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea when, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a marine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and paid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV Valkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s and hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea sickness tablets. According to local media, he didn\u2019t have a fishing license at the time.\nAfter buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on a course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in the Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the rendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western Australian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was seen \u201cunloading a lot of packages\u201d into a van, the commander said.\n\u201cWe knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of organized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and comes back with some gear on it, that it hasn\u2019t just dropped from the sky in the middle of the ocean.\u201d\nInvestigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car hire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug traffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say, that some of Smith\u2019s alleged co-conspirators were members of an ethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and Comanchero motorcycle gangs, known as \u201cbikies\u201d in Australia.\nAs they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of crystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor syndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy of an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians reconvened in Perth a month later.\nBikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and a self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had refined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star hotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police investigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants, said the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth. The restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that included caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.\nOn November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again, this time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the Andaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth from Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the Indian Ocean.\nThe Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.\nWhen the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in international waters off the West Australian coast on December 19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting \u201cmoney, money,\u201d according to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De Man\u2019s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith and his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved their identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by the crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.\nThe Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of Geraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The men unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of the AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault weapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty to importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of his alleged associates are still on trial.\nTaiwan\u2019s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it had \u201cworked together with our counterparts on the investigation\u201d of the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the \u201csubstantial seizure of illicit narcotics\u201d by the Australian authorities in December 2017. The bureau said it was \u201caware that Taiwanese syndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in (the) Asia-Pacific region,\u201d and was working \u201ccollaboratively and closely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and cross-border drug trafficking.\u201d\n\nNIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED\nAs the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police concluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone a kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the three biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the 1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The other two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse\u2019s original triad, and the Bamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator, the syndicate\u2019s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that it \u201cmust rival Apple\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cThe syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market to tap,\u201d said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior colonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade. \u201cThe power this network possesses is unimaginable.\u201d\nInvestigators have had wins. In February last year, police busted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough tea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66 was intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than one tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor lieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar. In December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected syndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.\nLocated near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed compound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used to experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a 100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to the back of the property.\nSue wasn\u2019t there, but property and money from 38 bank accounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized during the investigation. Sue is still at large.\nBut the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the wider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal meth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and Southeast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in most countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising seizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019, \u201csuggested the supply of the drug had expanded.\u201d\nIn the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive adversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug motherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product in shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth coming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the syndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This included deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each containing about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on narrow jungle paths.\nOver the years, police have had little success in taking down Asia\u2019s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders have been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to the AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics kingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than a short period was in the mid-1970s. That\u2019s when Ng Sik-ho, a wily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium and morphine, according to court records.\nSo far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho\u2019s fate. He is being tracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say counter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they believe he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.\n\n\n\n (Reporting by Tom Allard. Additional reporting by Reuters Staff. Editing by Peter Hirschberg.)",

        "text": "(For more Reuters Special Reports, click on)\nBy Tom Allard\nBANGKOK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - He is Asia\u2019s most-wanted man. He\nis protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private\njet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night\nat a Macau casino.\nTse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected\nof leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate\nformed out of an alliance of five of Asia\u2019s triad groups,\naccording to law enforcement officials. Its members call it\nsimply \u201cThe Company.\u201d Police, in a nod to one of Tse\u2019s\nnicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for \u201cBrother Number\nThree.\u201d\nThe syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of\nmethamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen\ncountries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South\nPacific. But meth \u2013 a highly addictive drug with devastating\nphysical and mental effects on long-term users \u2013 is its main\nbusiness, they say.\nIn what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations\nOffice on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s\nmeth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be\nas high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the\ncartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a\n40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has\nexpanded at least fourfold in the past five years.\nThis unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an\nunprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the\nprime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously\nunreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the\nAustralian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about\n20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far\nthe biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug\ntrafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in\nthe investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar,\nChina, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan,\nwhile not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the\ninvestigation.\nA document containing AFP profiles of the operation\u2019s top 19\nsyndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the\nleader of the syndicate. According to the document, the\norganization has \u201cbeen connected with or directly involved in at\nleast 13 cases\u201d of drug trafficking since January 2015. The\ndocument does not provide specific details of the cases.\nA Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the\n\u201cMultinational CEO\u201d of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement\nAdministration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional\ngovernment agencies says Tse is \u201cbelieved to be\u201d the leader of\nthe Sam Gor syndicate.\nPolice have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected\nboss of the trafficking group.\nSome investigators say that the scope of the syndicate\u2019s\noperation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin\nAmerica\u2019s most legendary narco-traffickers. \u201cTse Chi Lop is in\nthe league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,\u201d said Jeremy\nDouglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC.\n\u201cThe word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no\ndoubt it applies here.\u201d\nReuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to\nquestions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan\u2019s Ministry\nof Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on\ninvestigations.\nDuring the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific\nto uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This\nincluded interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement\nofficials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence\nreports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings\nand other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in\nMyanmar\u2019s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia\u2019s Golden\nTriangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing\ndrugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited\nthe Thai compound of one of the syndicate\u2019s alleged drug lords.\nWhat emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly\ntransnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the\nAFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often\nrefer to as \u201cT1\u201d - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong,\nMacau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.\nThe syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and\nsophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin\nAmerican cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies\na bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a\nmore diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels\ndo, including Japan\u2019s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic\nChinese gangs across Southeast Asia.\nThe crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled\noutbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police\nsay. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked\nrivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a\nunited pursuit of gargantuan profits.\n\u201cThe crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate\nwith seamless efficiency,\u201d says one veteran Western anti-drugs\nofficial. \u201cThey function like a global corporation.\u201d\nLike most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed,\nthe investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.\nIn addition to the contrasts between their drug operations,\nthere\u2019s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop\nand Joaquin \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed\nMexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine\ntrafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their\nextravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has\nbeen revealed about Tse\u2019s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug\nlords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.\n\nA TRIP, A TRAP\nTse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern\nChina, and grew up during China\u2019s Cultural Revolution. Amid the\nbloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group\nof imprisoned members of Mao\u2019s Red Guard in the southern city of\nGuangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big\nCircle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police,\nand like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong\nKong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their\ncriminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.\nIn the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong,\nMacau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based\nin Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling\nring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless\nopium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand,\nChina and Laos meet.\nIn 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on\ndrug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New\nYork. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into\nAmerica, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over\nhis head.\nThrough a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged\nfor leniency.\nHis ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His\n12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed.\nIf freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed\n\u201cgreat sorrow\u201d for his crime, court records show.\nThe entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to\nnine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional\ninstitution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.\nAfter he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to\nCanada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for\nthe next four years. It\u2019s unclear when Tse returned to his old\nhaunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife\nregistered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company\nLtd, in Hong Kong in 2011.\nPolice suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He\n\u201cpicked up where he left off,\u201d said the senior AFP investigator.\nTse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and\nthe Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved\nirresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his\ndrug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no\nextra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.\nHis policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for\nbusiness, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011,\nAFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and\nmeth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather\nthan arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under\nsurveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely\nfor more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug\ncell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They\nwanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.\nThe syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other\ndrug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and\nselling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the\nsyndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the\nMelbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police\nwatched the Australian meet two men.\nOne of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted\nhair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese\nfamily man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance\nshowed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal\nsecurity. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of\nThai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eight\nworked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as\npart of his security protocol.\nTse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts\nand five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in\nprivate jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand\nfor a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt,\naccording to a member of the task force investigating the\nsyndicate.\nTse was a frequent visitor to Asia\u2019s casinos and fond of\nbetting on horses, especially on English races. \u201cWe believe he\nlost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the\ntables in Macau,\u201d said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.\nAs the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected\nthat the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia\nwith meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA,\ncommonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the\nSam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say,\nwhen a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of\nwhite powder strapped to each of his thighs.\n\n\u2018ALADDIN\u2019S CAVE OF INTEL\u2019\nCai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the\nairport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It\nwas the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous,\npicking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said\na former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation.\n\u201cHis hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,\u201d the\ncommander told Reuters. \u201cMethamphetamine is very toxic.\u201d\nCai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs\nwas a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful\ntranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. \u201cWe were very\nfortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,\u201d the\ncommander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been\nmonitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police\nhad no idea who he was.\nCai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a\n\u201cpesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,\u201d according to\nMyanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A\nfriend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father.\nCai\u2019s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for\nketamine at the airport, the commander said.\nUnimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight.\nThe next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport.\nOne recognized him from surveillance work he\u2019d been conducting.\nStill, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they\nlater found on one of his phones might have explained his\nsilence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least\nthree assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch\nand electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said\none investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy\nsaying \u201cLoyalty to the Heavens.\u201d The banner was a \u201ctriad-related\nsign,\u201d he added.\nThe tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed\nthe video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat\nbecause he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a\nlaw enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of\nthe victim\u2019s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad\nmembers were sending a message about the price of disloyalty,\nthe officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.\nThe torture videos were just one of the items allegedly\nfound in Cai\u2019s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was\na diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate\u2019s activities, but\nsloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones,\npolice say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media\nconversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.\nThey were \u201can Aladdin\u2019s Cave of intel,\u201d said one AFP\ncommander based in North Asia.\nFor at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly\ntravelled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for\nthe syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the\nDrug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its\ninvestigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip\nfrom an international courier company recording the delivery of\ntwo consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf\nChinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea\npackets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had\nbeen cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.\nTwo days after Cai\u2019s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon\naddress, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That\nevening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon\njetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so,\nMyanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but\nother than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate,\nincluding couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.\nThen came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery\nof photos and videos on Cai\u2019s phones, an AFP investigator based\nin Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing\nhe had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier.\n\u201cThis one stuck out because it was Canadian,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI\nsaid: \u2018Fuck, I know who you are!'\u201d\nIt was Tse Chi Lop.\nThe Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of\nintelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work\non Cai\u2019s phones.\nAustralia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime\ngangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade,\nthe AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and\nsmall, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent\ndescribed the database, which includes a trove of names,\nchemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and\nsurveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence\non Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.\nThe AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai\u2019s\nphones with the database. They discovered photos related to\nthree big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in\nChina, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators\nand Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese\nanti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and\naddresses in Cai\u2019s phones to other meth busts in China.\nFor regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations\nupended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by\ndifferent crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the\nwork of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics\nagent said they believed Cai was \u201cone of the members of a\nmega-syndicate,\u201d which had been involved in multiple \u201cdrugs\ncases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.\u201d\nCai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still\nin jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking\ncharges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to\ncontact Cai\u2019s lawyer.\n\nMETH PARADISE\nDuring his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing\nthe country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and\nobtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a\nbigger vessel in international waters, according to police and\nthe Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures\nof the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where\nthe meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.\nThe police reconstruction of Cai\u2019s dealings in Myanmar led\nto another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production\nhad shifted from China\u2019s southern provinces to Shan State in\nMyanmar\u2019s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had\nprovided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor\ningredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were\nsmuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in\nthe Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the\nfreedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.\nArmed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan\nState have long controlled large tracts of territory and used\ndrug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the\nmilitary. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar\ngovernment with rebel groups over the years has brought relative\ncalm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to\nflourish.\n\u201cProduction facilities can be hidden from law enforcement\nand other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,\u201d\nanalyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the\nInternational Crisis Group. \u201cDrug production and profits are now\nso vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.\u201d\nThe Myanmar government and police did not respond to\nquestions from Reuters.\nAlong the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there\nis evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts\na deep ravine known as the \u201cValley of Death,\u201d where ethnic\nKachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for\ndecades with Myanmar\u2019s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past\ntrucks carrying building materials and workers.\nThe Kaung Kha militia\u2019s immaculate and expansive new\nheadquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green\nhills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers\naway, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved\nout of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned\nout vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba\ntablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine.\nWhen it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more\nthan 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg\nof caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances\nused in drug production.\nThe Loikan facility was \u201cvery likely\u201d to have been the\nsource of much of the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s meth, said the\nYangon-based AFP officer.\n\u201cSome militia were involved in the lab,\u201d said Oi Khun, a\ncommunications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia,\nin an interview. He paused, then added: \u201cBut not with the\nknowledge of senior members\u201d of the militia.\nOne person in Loikan described how workers from the lab\nwould come down from the hills. The men, like most of the\nvillagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the\nlocals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.\n\u201cI asked them once. \u2018Why don\u2019t you bathe?\u2019\u201d the person said.\n\u201cThey said they did, but there was nothing they could do about\nthe smell.\u201d\nThe rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the\nskin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature\nstench might reveal their illicit activities. \u201cWe all knew,\u201d the\nperson said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t talk about it. That just brings you\ndanger.\u201d\nMeth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals,\nsay Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network\u2019s\ncouriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the\nAsia-Pacific.\nShan\u2019s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the\nworld, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told\nReuters. \u201cThey can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the\nground and let it dry.\u201d\nThe UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth\nis worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business\nmodel for meth is \u201cvery different\u201d to heroin, said the UNODC\u2019s\nDouglas. \u201cInputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not\nneeded, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore\nfar, far higher.\u201d\nThe wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in\nnortheastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a\nUNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control\nCommission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to\nthe UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand,\n$298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the\nJapanese market, that\u2019s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.\nThe money the syndicate is making \u201cmeans that if they lose\nten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,\u201d\nsaid the Chinese counter-narcotics official. \u201cThey can afford\nfailure. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u2018MONEY, MONEY\u2019\nThe analysis of Cai\u2019s phones was continuing to provide\nleads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the\npick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with\nMyanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at\nsea for weeks.\nOne of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the\nShun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement\ndocument reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea\nwhen, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a\nmarine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and\npaid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV\nValkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s\nand hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea\nsickness tablets. According to local media, he didn\u2019t have a\nfishing license at the time.\nAfter buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on\na course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in\nthe Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the\nrendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western\nAustralian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was\nseen \u201cunloading a lot of packages\u201d into a van, the commander\nsaid.\n\u201cWe knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of\norganized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and\ncomes back with some gear on it, that it hasn\u2019t just dropped\nfrom the sky in the middle of the ocean.\u201d\nInvestigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car\nhire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug\ntraffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say,\nthat some of Smith\u2019s alleged co-conspirators were members of an\nethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and\nComanchero motorcycle gangs, known as \u201cbikies\u201d in Australia.\nAs they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of\ncrystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor\nsyndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy\nof an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians\nreconvened in Perth a month later.\nBikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and\na self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had\nrefined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star\nhotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police\ninvestigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants,\nsaid the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth.\nThe restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that\nincluded caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.\nOn November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again,\nthis time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the\nAndaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth\nfrom Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast\nof the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the\nIndian Ocean.\nThe Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.\nWhen the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in\ninternational waters off the West Australian coast on December\n19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting \u201cmoney, money,\u201d\naccording to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De\nMan\u2019s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith\nand his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved\ntheir identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by\nthe crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.\nThe Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of\nGeraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The\nmen unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of\nthe AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault\nweapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty\nto importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of\nhis alleged associates are still on trial.\nTaiwan\u2019s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it\nhad \u201cworked together with our counterparts on the investigation\u201d\nof the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the \u201csubstantial\nseizure of illicit narcotics\u201d by the Australian authorities in\nDecember 2017. The bureau said it was \u201caware that Taiwanese\nsyndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in\n(the) Asia-Pacific region,\u201d and was working \u201ccollaboratively and\nclosely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and\ncross-border drug trafficking.\u201d\n\nNIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED\nAs the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police\nconcluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone\na kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the\nthree biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the\n1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The\nother two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse\u2019s original triad, and the\nBamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator,\nthe syndicate\u2019s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that\nit \u201cmust rival Apple\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cThe syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market\nto tap,\u201d said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior\ncolonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade.\n\u201cThe power this network possesses is unimaginable.\u201d\nInvestigators have had wins. In February last year, police\nbusted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough\ntea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66\nwas intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than\none tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor\nlieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar.\nIn December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected\nsyndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.\nLocated near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed\ncompound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used\nto experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a\n100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to\nthe back of the property.\nSue wasn\u2019t there, but property and money from 38 bank\naccounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized\nduring the investigation. Sue is still at large.\nBut the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the\nwider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal\nmeth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and\nSoutheast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in\nmost countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising\nseizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019,\n\u201csuggested the supply of the drug had expanded.\u201d\nIn the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive\nadversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug\nmotherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product\nin shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth\ncoming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the\nsyndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This\nincluded deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each\ncontaining about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on\nnarrow jungle paths.\nOver the years, police have had little success in taking\ndown Asia\u2019s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders\nhave been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to\nthe AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics\nkingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than\na short period was in the mid-1970s. That\u2019s when Ng Sik-ho, a\nwily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced\nto 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium\nand morphine, according to court records.\nSo far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho\u2019s fate. He is being\ntracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say\ncounter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they\nbelieve he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.\n(Reporting by Tom Allard. Additional reporting by Reuters\nStaff. Editing by Peter Hirschberg.)",

        "text": "By Nellie Peyton\nNEW YORK, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda on\nThursday announced plans for a bill that would impose the death\npenalty on homosexuals, following plans announced by Brunei\nearlier this year to do the same.\nSame-sex relations are illegal in at least 68 countries\naround the world, according to the International Lesbian, Gay,\nBisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA).\nIn addition to Uganda and Brunei, here are eight countries\nthat have recently moved to roll back LGBT+ rights.\n\n1. United States\nThe United States began implementing a ban on transgender\npeople serving in the military this year, after President Donald\nTrump announced the change in 2017.\nTrump cited medical costs as one reason for rolling back a\n2016 policy of his predecessor Barack Obama, which had allowed\ntransgender people to serve openly for the first time and also\nreceive medical care to transition genders.\n\n2. Russia\nRussia fined its first minor last year under a so-called\n\"gay propaganda\" law that has been increasingly used to repress\nthe LGBT+ community.\nThe 2013 law makes illegal any event or act regarded by the\nauthorities as an attempt to promote homosexuality to minors. It\nhas been used to stop gay pride marches and detain gay rights\nactivists.\n\n3. Poland\nPoland's ruling party leader condemned gay pride marches\nthis year and said the rule of law should be used to regulate\nwhat he called a \"travelling theatre\".\nAhead of elections later this month, the conservative Law\nand Justice (PiS) party has used its anti-LGBT+ stance as a key\ncampaign issue, which critics say has fomented violence toward\nthe gay community.\n\n4. Indonesia\nIndonesia has drafted a law that would ban gay sex, which\nparliament delayed voting on last month amid protests.\nThe proposed revisions to the criminal code also include a\nban on sex outside of marriage, a four-year jail term for\nabortions in the absence of a medical emergency or rape and a\nprison term for black magic.\n\n5. Nigeria\nNigeria passed a bill in 2014 that criminalized same-sex\nrelationships with penalties of up to 14 years in prison.\nAuthorities charged 43 people with homosexual acts in one\ncase in 2017, ordering most to undergo monitoring and \"sexual\nrehabilitation.\"\n\n6. Malaysia\nMalaysia's LGBT+ community has faced growing persecution,\nwith two women caned in public for \"attempting lesbian sex\" in\nthe state of Terengganu last year.\nPrime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the leader of a new\ngovernment elected last year, has said the country cannot accept\nsame-sex marriage or LGBT+ rights.\n\n7. Chad\nChad introduced a new penal code in 2017 with light prison\nsentences and fines for same-sex relations which had not been\nexplicitly criminalized before, although there was a law\ncondemning \"acts against nature\", according to the ILGA.\nAn earlier draft of the legislation from 2014 would have\ncriminalized gay sex with up to 20 years in prison.\n\n8. Slovakia\nSlovakia inserted a definition of traditional marriage in\nits constitution in 2014.\nIn 2015 the country held a referendum which would have\nstrengthened its ban on marriage and child adoption by same-sex\ncouples, but it failed to pass on low voter turnout.\n(Writing by Nellie Peyton; Editing by Chris Michaud.

        "text": "By Michael Taylor\nKUALA LUMPUR, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -\nS outheast Asian governments must improve cross-border\ncollaboration if they are serious about punishing companies\nfound to have started forest fires that send harmful smoke\ndrifting across the region, researchers said on Thursday.\nEnvironment officials from the 10-member Association of\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) met in Cambodia this week, where\nthe Malaysian delegation reportedly raised the issue of air\npollution caused by a spike in fires, mostly in Indonesia.\n\"At the moment there is a lot of finger-pointing,\" said\nHelena Varkkey, a lecturer at the University of Malaya in Kuala\nLumpur, who has researched the problem for more than 15 years.\nIndonesia has accused Malaysian firms over fires on its\nland, while Malaysia has denied responsibility or insisted\nIndonesia should act, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nIndonesia and its Southeast Asian neighbours are regularly\nhit by thick smog from slash-and-burn clearance of land and\nforests for palm oil production and farming, causing premature\ndeaths, respiratory infections, and school and airport closures.\nLast month, the environment ministers of Malaysia and\nIndonesia traded blame for this year's haze, with Jakarta\ncalling out local subsidiaries of Malaysian companies.\nMalaysia's environment minister, Yeo Bee Yin, last week said\na new law was being drafted to hold Malaysian businesses and\nindividuals accountable for causing pollution in foreign\ncountries, local media reported.\nBut a similar law introduced in neighbouring Singapore - the\nTransboundary Haze Pollution Act 2014 - has had little impact\ndue to a lack of maps and support from Indonesian authorities,\nforest experts said.\nVarkkey said Malaysia's new law would help it address\ncompany activities by alleviating \"political sensitivities\".\n\"Malaysia has the benefit of having the Singaporean law\n'model' that was established earlier, so it has a good\nopportunity to examine the strengths and weaknesses of that\nexercise and come up with a law that will be more effective,\"\nshe added.\nThis year's haze is the worst since 2015, with 66,000 fire\nalerts in Indonesia from January through the end of September,\naccording to the World Resources Institute (WRI), an\nenvironmental think-tank.\nThe 2015 haze outbreak - which cost Indonesia $16 billion -\nwas linked to more than 100,000 premature deaths in Indonesia,\nMalaysia and Singapore, according to a Harvard University study.\n\"Of the countries historically most responsible for the\nworld's deforestation, Indonesia is the only one that's actually\nreduced its deforestation rate in recent years,\" WRI Indonesia\nresearchers wrote this week.\n\"This year's fires season could derail this promising\ntrend,\" they added.\nAt the ASEAN meeting in Siem Reap, officials vowed to work\ntogether to achieve a haze-free region by 2020.\nBut few details were given on how that would be achieved,\nother than speeding up the establishment of an ASEAN centre to\nsupport coordinated action.\nMalaysia's environment minister and Indonesia's delegation\nat the ASEAN gathering did not respond to requests for comment.\n(Reporting by Michael Taylor @MickSTaylor; Editing by Megan\nRowling.

        "text": "By Beh Lih Yi\nKUALA LUMPUR, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A\nMalaysian recruitment agency set to launch a pioneering\n\"ethical\" hiring model has called for an industry overhaul to\ntackle debt bondage among migrant workers and end modern slavery\nin the Southeast Asian nation.\nLed by a team of three women, Kuala Lumpur-based Pinkcollar\nhas billed itself as the first ethical recruitment agency in\nMalaysia, which relies heavily on foreign labourers to fill jobs\nin construction, factories or domestic care.\nThe company will drop the hefty fees usually imposed by\nrecruitment firms on workers for helping them find jobs, an\nindustry-wide policy that has pushed thousands of people into\ncrippling debt they are rarely able to escape.\n\"We are trying to disrupt it (the industry) really,\" founder\nZenna Law told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at Pinkcollar's\noffice ahead of the \"ethical\" scheme's launch on Wednesday.\n\"We are hoping that ... we can elevate the standard of the\nentire industry,\" said Law, who along with her partners is in\nher 20s and was raised with the help of migrant domestic workers\nas a child.\nMalaysia is home to millions of foreign labourers and one of\nthe top destinations in Asia for impoverished women from\ncountries such as Indonesia and the Philippines who take up jobs\nas domestic workers.\nCases of abuse have been widely reported, but migrant rights\ngroups say workers often cannot escape as they have to work to\nrepay the recruiters that found them work and make deductions\nfrom their monthly wages.\nThe Malaysian government said last year it was looking into\nways to cut middlemen and end debt bondage, a form of modern-day\nslavery.\nAlthough it is a first for Malaysia, ethical recruiters have\nsprung up in the Philippines and Hong Kong in recent years as\nbusinesses and private households come under pressure to end\nslavery.\nPinkcollar will focus on domestic workers from the\nPhilippines in its first phase, recruiting through social media\nbefore matching them with employers through interviews that give\nboth parties a say in the hiring process and terms.\nThe hiring fees, which typically range from 12,000 to 18,000\nMalaysian ringgit ($2,900-$4,300), will be payable by the\nemployer, said Pinkcollar's Law.\nThe firm's name is derived from the term given to jobs\nusually held by women - such as nannies and helpers.\n\"When workers owe agencies, not only they have less freedom\nto switch jobs but also to leave bad and unsafe work place. Debt\nbondage is what we are trying to tackle,\" Law said.\nMigrant rights groups welcomed the initiative but warned its\nimplementation could be problematic as countries such as\nIndonesia would only allow workers to go abroad through its\nlocally-approved agencies.\n\"It could be quite chaotic for the sending country because\nthey want to monitor the whereabouts of the workers,\" said Alex\nOng from advocacy group Migrant Care, which campaigns for\nmigrant workers in Malaysia.\nRecruitment agencies are not allowed to charge workers in\nthe formal sectors - such as manufacturing and plantation - fees\nthat are higher one month's salary, under current guidelines set\nby the employers' group, the Malaysian Employers' Federation.\nBut domestic workers are excluded from the clause, and\ntypically have to spend six months with almost all their wages\ndeducted to cover the costs they owe the recruiters for local\ntravel or medical tests, said Ong.\n\"The question is why this protection is not applicable for\ndomestic workers too,\" asked Ong, calling for a legal reform.\nMalaysia is home to an estimated 212,000 of about 40 million\npeople trapped in modern slavery worldwide, according to the\nGlobal Slavery Index by human rights group Walk Free Foundation.\n($1 = 4.1910 ringgit)\n(Reporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi; Editing by Michael Taylor.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

        "text": "(Reworks and updates with Cate Blanchett quotes)\nBy Emma Batha\nLONDON, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Film star Cate\nBlanchett called on Monday for the world to end the\n\"devastating\" plight of millions of people with no nationality\namid warnings that rising xenophobia is stymieing efforts to\nmeet a 2024 deadline for eradicating statelessness.\nThe double Oscar-winner said statelessness prevented people\nfulfilling their potential, and was a \"heartbreaking\" waste of\nhuman talent.\nBlanchett threw her weight behind the global #Ibelong\ncampaign to end statelessness as she addressed an\nintergovernmental meeting in Geneva aimed at dramatically\nescalating progress.\nHer support will boost attention on an issue that has long\nbeen neglected.\nNot recognised as nationals of any country, stateless people\nare often deprived of basic rights like education and\nhealthcare, and risk exploitation and detention.\nBlanchett held up her own passport, credit card and Medicare\ncard as she urged ministers and government officials to imagine\nhow difficult life would be if they had no documents.\n\"It's a condition of invisibility,\" she said. \"Stateless\npeople are unseen and unheard.\"\nBlanchett, a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. refugee agency\n(UNHCR), interviewed Maha Mamo, a formerly stateless activist\nwho has become a torchbearer for #Ibelong, describing her as an\n\"extraordinary beacon of hope\".\nThe activist, who speaks five languages, told delegates how\nher hopes of studying medicine and joining a Lebanese basketball\nteam were crushed because she had no papers.\nThe Geneva meeting comes halfway through the #Ibelong\ninitiative launched in 2014.\nBut the task ahead is monumental. Only about 200,000 people\nacquired citizenship during the first half of the campaign,\nbarely making a dent in the overall number.\nAnd U.N. officials admit the total may now be even higher\nthan in 2014 because of increasing displacement triggered by\ncrises in Syria, Venezuela and elsewhere, which has raised the\nrisk of many children growing up stateless.\nThere is also no solution in sight for many of the largest\ngroups of stateless people including the Rohingya, hundreds of\nthousands of whom have fled to Bangladesh following an upsurge\nin violence.\nU.N. officials are also keeping a close eye on India, where\n1.9 million people in the northeastern state of Assam have been\nleft off a register of citizens, stoking concerns that many\ncould become stateless.\nUNHCR chief Filippo Grandi said global awareness of the\nrepercussions of statelessness was growing and they had received\nmore than 170 pledges of action ahead of the meeting.\nBut he warned that \"damaging forms of nationalism\" and the\n\"manipulation of anti-refugee and migrant sentiment\" were\nputting progress at risk.\nDOGS HAVE MORE RIGHTS\nPeople end up stateless for a host of reasons including\nmigration, flawed citizenship laws and ethnic discrimination.\nOthers fall through the cracks when countries break up.\nAside from Myanmar, there are big stateless groups in Ivory\nCoast, Thailand, Nepal, Kuwait and some former Soviet countries.\nStateless people have previously told the Thomson Reuters\nFoundation that they feel stigmatised and forgotten.\n\"We've had people telling us, 'dogs are more important than\nI am',\" said Melanie Khanna, head of the UNHCR's statelessness\nsection.\n\"People feel totally scarred and isolated. They often say,\n'I thought it was just me'. It sends chills down your spine.\"\nAlmost all countries are represented at the Geneva meeting,\nwith some 1,000 delegates including a number of ministers. U.N.\nofficials say the pledges will provide a roadmap for\naccelerating the campaign.\nIn July, Kyrgyzstan made history when it became the first\ncountry to officially end statelessness. U.N. officials believe\nTurkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan could also meet the\n2024 deadline.\nThailand, where nearly 479,000 people are stateless,\nincluding members of ethnic hill tribes in the northern border\nregions, is also stepping up action.\nThe issue made international headlines last year during\nrescue efforts to save a young Thai football team trapped in a\nflooded cave.\nDuring the drama it emerged that several of the boys and\ntheir coach were stateless. They were granted citizenship after\ntheir ordeal.\n\nWIN-WIN\nBut resolving statelessness is not just a human rights\nissue. Statelessness has fuelled conflict and displacement in\nboth Myanmar and Ivory Coast.\nKhanna said there was a growing recognition that resolving\nstatelessness was a \"win-win\" because it was in governments'\ninterests to have everybody feel invested in the society they\nlived in and motivated to contribute.\nThe U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of\nglobal pledges on tackling poverty, inequality and other ills\nwith an overall ambition to \"to leave no one behind\", have\nhelped shift attitudes, Khanna said.\n\"The SDGs have allowed us to talk about this whole area as a\ndevelopment issue and not just a human rights one,\" she added.\n\"This makes a lot of sense because you don't want\ndisenfranchised, impoverished people on your territory.\"\nKhanna said an increasing number of countries were changing\ntheir nationality laws and policies to prevent future\ngenerations ending up in limbo.\nColombia, for example, has announced it will give\ncitizenship to thousands of children born to Venezuelan migrants\nto prevent them growing up stateless.\nOther countries have scrapped discriminatory laws that\nprevent women passing their citizenship to their children - a\nmajor cause of statelessness.\nThe impact of such laws has been clearly seen during the\nSyrian war with many displaced mothers unable to obtain\ndocuments for their children where the father is dead or absent.\nIran became the latest country to pass reforms last week.\nThere has also been a flurry of countries joining the U.N.\nconventions on protecting stateless people and preventing\nstatelessness.\nThe 1961 convention stipulates that a state must grant\nnationality to anyone born on its territory who would otherwise\nbe stateless - a safeguard that would wipe out most new cases of\nstatelessness if adopted by all countries.\nBlanchett appealed to all nations to give stateless people\n\"their basic human right to belong\", adding that solutions were\noften straightforward.\n\"It is a man-made problem and it is solvable,\" she said.\n(Reporting by Emma Batha @emmabatha; Editing by Claire Cozens.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

        "text": "By Hannah McNeish\nLAMU, Kenya, Oct 28 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Fishing\ncommunities on Kenya's north coast will be the first to benefit\nfrom \"smart\" identity cards aimed at distinguishing genuine\nfishermen and loggers from poachers who raid waters and cut down\nmangroves vital to ease climate change threats.\nEach government-issued Mvuvi card - the word means \"fisher\"\nin Swahili - features a photo and fingerprint taken from its\nregistered owner.\nAuthorities will be able to read the cards using smartphones\nloaded with communications software that allows short-range\nwireless data transfers.\nOfficials hope the cards, being used first in Lamu County,\nhome to what the government says are about 60% of Kenya's\nprotected mangrove forests, will boost security and curb illegal\nfishing and logging.\n\"There are people who pretend to be fishermen going out to\nsea but they are doing illegal logging of the mangroves,\" Samson\nMacharia, commissioner of Lamu County, told the Thomson Reuters\nFoundation in a telephone interview.\n\"Over-harvesting of mangroves will affect (impacts from)\nclimate change and ecosystems all along the shores of the coast\nand the islands,\" he added.\nEnvironmental scientists have long stressed the important\nrole mangrove forests play in reducing global warming threats.\nMangroves are far more effective at absorbing and storing\ncarbon dioxide - one of the major drivers of climate change -\nthan trees on land, they say.\nThe trees' roots also trap and hold sediment, providing a\ncoastal buffer against storms and protection from floods, as\nwell as creating an important fish breeding ground.\nMore than 35% of the world's mangroves are already gone and\nthey are disappearing three to five times faster than other\nforests, according to international conservation group WWF.\nFigures published by Kenya's Ministry of Environment and\nForestry show that the country lost about 20% of its mangroves\nbetween 1985 and 2009.\nOf the mangroves that remain, an estimated 40% are degraded.\n\"In the mangroves, we have witnessed 'die-back', which is\nmangroves just drying up,\" said John Bett, who works on\nsustainable forestry for WWF-Kenya.\nBett said he has seen the effects of climate change in Lamu\nCounty gather pace in the last 10 to 15 years and that the rate\nof mangrove regeneration, which can occur naturally as seeds\nfall from trees onto the mud, has \"slowed down dramatically\".\nOnly loggers registered with Kenya's Forestry Service are\nallowed to cut mangroves in Lamu County and only within certain\nquotas and areas, he explained.\nBut without knowing who exactly is on the water, cracking\ndown on those fishing or logging mangroves illegally has been a\nchallenge, he stressed.\n\nSALTIER LAND, EMPTIER SEAS\nCoastal communities in Kenya are already struggling with the\neffects of climate change.\nGlobally, scientists have warned that water temperatures are\nincreasing far faster than expected due to carbon emissions.\nAs oceans warm, they expand, driving rising sea levels\nwhich, along with more erratic weather, make farmland\nincreasingly vulnerable to flooding and failed harvests.\nHotter seas also fuel more powerful cyclones and other\nstorms, which can drive saltwater onto land.\nWith fewer mangrove forests to buffer coastal land, soil is\nbecoming salty - which kills crops - and or is being washed away\nby heavy rains, scientists say.\nWarming oceans also threaten fish, especially in areas such\nas Kenya that have experienced coral bleaching.\n\"Fishermen report that some of the species are disappearing\nbecause of the increase of temperatures and the damaged corals\nand increasing bleaching, so you find breeding areas have\nreduced drastically,\" said Bett of the WWF.\nBett has seen local fishermen become poorer and more\ndesperate, with some taking bigger risks to net increasingly\nsmaller catches. Others haven given up fishing entirely, he\nsaid.\n\"We have witnessed decreased stocks, so fishermen are now\ngoing further, beyond the reefs they are used to, whereas 10 to\n15 years ago they would just fish near the reefs,\" he said.\nBett also noted that local fishermen using traditional\nmethods and small wooden boats struggle to compete with foreign\nvessels that fish using more modern gear.\nSECURITY QUESTIONS\nFunded by the European Union and the United States Agency\nfor International Development (USAID), the Mvuvi card project\noriginally launched in 2018, with a pilot phase that handed out\n250 cards to fishermen on Kiwayu Island in Lamu County.\nThose cards were eventually canceled due to the discovery of\nsecurity gaps in the system, explained Mathenge Ndungu,\nprogramme manager of the Kiunga Youth Bunge Initiative (KYBI).\nThe local civil society group is in charge of finding and\nregistering fishermen for the card.\nThe group is now working with the government to\nstrengthening the security of participants' personal information\nand is in discussions over allocating space on the government's\nservers to store that database, Ndungu said.\nIn the meantime, KYBI has registered 700 fishermen and hopes\nto issue them all with cards by the end of the month.\n\"We are targeting 1,000 fishermen to be issued with cards in\nthe first phase,\" said Ndungu.\nThe hope, he said, is that the Mvuvi card will succeed in\nprotecting a fishing industry already severely stressed by the\ncombination of climate change, poaching and mangrove loss.\nAli Tewa, 34, who comes from Kiwayu, started fishing when he\nleft school at 16 and remembers a time when the fish were\nplentiful in the waters around Lamu County.\n\"Back then, in the 1990s, you could go (out) for between\nhalf an hour and three hours to catch around 200 kilogrammes\n(440 pounds) of fish,\" he said.\n\"Now, you can go a whole day without catching any.\"\n(Reporting by Hannah McNeish; Editing by Jumana Farouky and\nLaurie Goering.

        "text": "By Wesley Langat\nMACHAKOS, Kenya, Oct 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - For\nthe past two years, Beatrice Ndavi, a 56-year-old farmer in\ncentral Kenya, has received vouchers for good-quality seeds and\nfertiliser, as well as training to improve her yields.\nThe support is offered on credit as part of an insurance\nscheme that provides security for the farmer\u2019s loan by paying it\ndown if her harvest is damaged by extreme weather.\nNdavi, a mother of six from Masii village in Machakos\nCounty, explained that in the past, farmers ended up taking out\ncash loans to cover their needs in an emergency, which they then\nstruggled to pay back.\nBut under the Risk-Contingent Credit (RCC) scheme she is\npart of, it has become easier for her to keep going, even if the\nweather is bad, she said.\n\u201cI get the right farm inputs - quality seeds and fertilisers\non time - and I\u2019m not worried about how to repay the loan as\nit\u2019s insured,\u201d she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\nRAIN-BASED PAYOUTS\nMillions of rural households in Kenya rely on agriculture\nfor their income, but a warming climate is bringing more intense\nand frequent droughts, disrupting production.\nRecurring losses due to sometimes consecutive years of\ndrought, coupled with the high cost of certified seeds and other\ninputs, have made poor farmers reluctant to invest in their\nland, organisations working on the RCC project found.\nApurba Shee, lead researcher with the Natural Resources\nInstitute at Britain\u2019s University of Greenwich, said the credit\nscheme differs from traditional insurance as it takes into\naccount rainfall patterns as they unfold rather than paying out\nonly when harvests fail.\nRemote-sensing satellite technology is used to track\nrainfall in real-time, and if the average drops below a set\nthreshold in any 21-day period during the growing season, it\ntriggers digital payouts that cover farmers\u2019 loans.\nThe system allows for multiple payments spread throughout\nthe season, as rain volumes fluctuate, Shee said.\nThe RCC programme aims to tackle both credit constraints and\nrisks linked to drought, he said in an interview.\n\u201cWe are getting clear positive indications in term of\nincreased farming investments (and) farmers going back to\nfarming more often, even after a devastating drought,\u201d he added.\nAccording to a 2018 survey, nearly 1,200 farmers in Machakos\nhad enrolled in the RCC scheme, with 40% taking out insured\nloans to buy farm inputs.\nThe average amount they received was 8,500 Kenyan shillings\n($82), compared with 6,000 shillings ($58) for traditional\nloans.\nIn the neighbouring county of Embu, about 800 farmers are\ntaking part in the U.S. government-backed project.\nShee said the RCC scheme had now proved itself to be\ncommercially viable and had the potential to be expanded to\nother parts of Kenya and semi-arid regions across southern and\neastern Africa, as well as along the borders of the Sahara.\n\nDWINDLING CAPITAL\nBefore joining the scheme, Ndavi struggled when persistent\ndrought brought water shortages, as she \u2013 like many other\nfarmers in Kenya\u2019s drylands \u2013 relies on regular rainfall to keep\nher crops in good health.\nIn 2017, she lost five acres of planted maize worth $100\nbecause of drought.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have any other means of recovering my losses, so I\nwent back to my savings to farm again in the following season,\u201d\nshe said, pointing to her land, which was again dry and bare.\nMore severe droughts are leaving many farmers increasingly\nvulnerable and with less capital to invest in their business,\nsaid Sarfraz Shah, project manager at Nairobi-based APA\nInsurance, which underwrites the RCC scheme.\nSome farmers are wary of borrowing money, and in other\ncases, financial institutions are reluctant to lend to them,\nviewing them as high risk \u2013 which feeds into a vicious circle of\nlower productivity, he noted.\n\u201cIf there is no loan given to these smallholder farmers,\nthey will not be able to farm - but the beauty of this insurance\nis, if there is bad weather, we pay claims,\u201d Shah said.\n\nCONFIDENCE BOOST\nMoses Kyalo, another farmer from Masii village, said his\nfarm had become more sustainable since he signed up to the RCC\nscheme in 2017, giving him access to training and insured credit\nto help boost production.\nLast year, he took out a loan for 10,000 shillings and\nreceived seeds and fertiliser in lieu of cash.\nHis crops did not do well because of insufficient rain, but\nthe loan insurance paid off part of his losses, he said.\n\u201cIt gave me confidence to increase my investments into\nfarming, unlike before,\u201d he said.\nFarmers in the RCC scheme also receive training in\nagricultural practices and finance.\nWillis Ogutu Odhiambo, an agricultural field officer with\nEquity Group Foundation, a social arm of Kenya\u2019s Equity Bank\nwhich provides the training, said some farmers lacked the\nknowledge to succeed and could not borrow money to expand.\n\u201cOr if they get the loans, they misuse it and now they have\nthe burden of repaying the loans,\u201d he said.\nLiangzhi You, a scientist with the Washington-based\nInternational Food Policy Research Institute, which co-led and\ndesigned the RCC project, emphasised the benefits of helping\nfarmers prepare for and cope better with climate threats.\n\u201cIf the droughts come, it takes much more resources to deal\nwith than building resilience which is economical and cheaper,\u201d\nhe said.\n(Reporting by Wesley Langat; editing by Megan Rowling.

        "text": "By Thin Lei Win\nROME, Oct 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Farmers around\nthe world are losing up to 20% of the food they produce every\nyear but action can be taken to reduce this, according to the\nUnited Nations on Monday as it quantified such losses for the\nfirst time.\nA combination of causes, ranging from harvesting and\nhandling practices, to lack of infrastructure and market prices\nto pests, diseases and climatic conditions, contributed to these\nlosses, said the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\nThis \"means that land and water resources have been wasted,\npollution created and greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted to no\npurpose\", said FAO Director-General Qu Dongyu in a report\nreleased ahead of World Food Day on Oct. 16.\nAn earlier, widely-cited figure estimated about a third of\nthe world's food - about 1.3 billion tonnes - was lost or wasted\nannually but that was a rough figure including estimates for\nlosses along the whole supply chain, according to the FAO.\nThe FAO said the latest numbers, which showed 14% losses\nglobally, focused on losses between harvest and markets and\nshowed variations among the world's regions and commodities.\nCentral and southern Asia have the highest level of food\nlosses of 20% followed by northern America and Europe at more\nthan 15%. Australia and New Zealand have the lowest at about 6%.\n\"This number is important because now we can measure the\neffects of different policies to reduce losses and we can track\nit over time to see if we're improving or not,\" said the FAO's\nAssistant Director-General Maximo Torero Cullen.\nWith the right policies the world \"can eliminate a\nsignificant amount of that 14% food loss\" but this had costs and\ndepended on lawmakers, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\"Reductions in the early stages of the food supply chain is\nmost effective in addressing food security or natural resources\nstress, but reduction of food waste by consumers and retailers\nis the best to reduce GHG emissions,\" he added.\nThe findings show losses of one in four roots, tubers and\noil-bearing crops, such as cassava and potatoes, and more than\none in five fruits and vegetables, but less than 10% in cereals\nand pulses.\nSlashing these losses on the farm could increase food\navailability for small-scale farmers in low-income countries who\nmight also make money selling the surplus, but a glut in produce\ncould depress prices as well as demand, the report warned.\nAlso some losses were easier to address than others. Making\nair-conditioned storage available in rural locations without\nproper roads or electricity would take time but others might\nonly require small adjustments, Torero Cullen said.\nFor example in Ghana, switching from conventional bags to\ntriple-layer bags with an air-tight seal can protect cassava\nchips and maize from insects and fungus, according to\nWashington-based International Food Policy Research Institute.\nNew technologies could also help. California-based start-up\nApeel Sciences produces a plant-based coating that comes in\npowder form and, when applied with water, can double the shelf\nlife of fruits and vegetables without refrigeration.\nIt is being tested on mangoes and cassava in Africa.\n\"Our hope is that with better information and better quality\ndata, we can accelerate this process of reducing food loss,\"\nsaid Torero Cullen. \"This is a big step towards action.\"\n(Reporting By Thin Lei Win @thinink, Editing by Belinda\nGoldsmith\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, climate\nchange, women's and LGBT+ rights, human trafficking, and\nproperty rights.

        "text": "(Updates with fresh details, quotes throughout)\nBy Nita Bhalla\nNAIROBI, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda\nannounced plans on Thursday for a bill that would impose the\ndeath penalty on homosexuals, saying the legislation would curb\na rise in unnatural sex in the east African nation.\nThe bill - colloquially known as \"Kill the Gays\" in Uganda -\nwas nullified five years ago on a technicality and the\ngovernment said it plans to resurrect it within weeks.\n\"Homosexuality is not natural to Ugandans, but there has\nbeen a massive recruitment by gay people in schools, and\nespecially among the youth, where they are promoting the\nfalsehood that people are born like that,\" Ethics and Integrity\nMinister Simon Lokodo told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\"Our current penal law is limited. It only criminalises the\nact. We want it made clear that anyone who is even involved in\npromotion and recruitment has to be criminalised. Those that do\ngrave acts will be given the death sentence.\"\nAfrican countries have some of the world's most prohibitive\nlaws governing homosexuality. Same-sex relationships are\nconsidered taboo and gay sex is a crime across most of the\ncontinent, with punishments ranging from imprisonment to death.\nEarlier this year, Brunei sparked international outcry over\nplans to impose the death penalty for gay sex, backtracking only\nafter intense criticism.\nNow Uganda wants to follow suit.\nLokodo said the bill, which is supported by President Yoweri\nMuseveni, will be re-introduced in parliament in the coming\nweeks and is expected to be voted on before the end of the year.\nHe was optimistic it would pass with the necessary\ntwo-thirds of members present - a shortfall in numbers killed a\nsimilar bill in 2014 - as the government had lobbied legislators\nahead of its re-introduction, Lokodo added.\n\"We have been talking to the MPs and we have mobilised them\nin big numbers,\" said Lokodo. \"Many are supportive.\"\nUganda's constitutional court overturned the law - formerly\nknown as the \"Kill the Gays\" bill because it includes the death\npenalty - on a technicality in 2014.\nEven without it, Uganda is one of the hardest countries in\nAfrica to be a sexual minority. Under British colonial law, gay\nsex is punishable with up to life imprisonment and activists\nsaid the new bill risked unleashing attacks.\n\"Bringing back anti-gay legislation would invariably lead to\na spike in discrimination and atrocities,\" said Zahra Mohamed of\nthe Toronto-based charity Stephen Lewis Foundation.\n\nFEARFUL\nMoves to restrict LGBT+ rights and criminalise gay sex in\nother countries have sparked protests and sanctions.\nIn May, Brunei was forced to extend a moratorium on the\ndeath penalty for gay sex after celebrities such as actor George\nClooney condemned a law allowing whipping and stoning to death.\nLast November, anti-gay remarks by a senior official in\nTanzania led to the east African nation's second biggest donor,\nDenmark, withholding $10 million in aid.\nUganda faced widespread international condemnation when the\nprevious bill was signed off by Museveni in 2014.\nThe United States reduced aid, imposed visa restrictions and\ncancelled military exercises. The World Bank, Sweden, Norway,\nDenmark and the Netherlands also suspended or redirected aid.\nLokodo said Uganda was prepared for any negative response.\n\"It is a concern,\" he said.\n\"But we are ready. We don't like blackmailing. Much as we\nknow that this is going to irritate our supporters in budget and\ngovernance, we can't just bend our heads and bow before people\nwho want to impose a culture which is foreign to us.\"\nPepe Julian Onziema from Sexual Minorities Uganda, an\nalliance of LGBT+ organisations, said its members were fearful.\n\"When the law was introduced last time, it whipped up\nhomophobic sentiment and hate crimes,\" said Onziema.\n\"Hundreds of LGBT+ people have been forced to leave the\ncountry as refugees and more will follow if this law is enacted.\nIt will criminalise us from even advocated for LGBT+ rights, let\nalone supporting and protecting sexual minorities.\"\nOnziema said three gay men and one transgender woman had\nbeen killed in homophobic attacks in Uganda this year - the\nlatest last week when a gay man was bludgeoned to death.\n(Reporting by Nita Bhalla.

        "text": "By Maina Waruru\nNAIROBI, Kenya, Oct 8 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -\nH appiness Kapota will remember forever the day when her children\nlined up in Nairobi to receive their birth certificates.\nJoyce, Caleb and Sidet Moyo were among the first children\nfrom Kenya's stateless Shona group to receive the\ngovernment-issued certificates, which will give them\nopportunities and rights long denied to the Shona.\nThe day was particularly poignant for Kapota, 25, because\nshe was barred from sitting a key school exam for lack of\ndocuments, forcing her to drop out at 15.\n\"My teachers tried to help but there's nothing they could\ndo, so I dropped out and became a housemaid since we were very\npoor,\" Kapota told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding she\nhoped to return to school one day.\nKenya's move to end the plight of the Shona comes amid a\nglobal campaign to eradicate statelessness thought to affect an\nestimated 10 million people worldwide who are not recognised as\nnationals by any country.\nKenya sent a high-level delegation to a major\nintergovernmental meeting in Geneva on Monday to discuss\nprogress at the midpoint of the #Ibelong campaign, ahead of a\n2024 deadline.\nA person may be stateless as a result of discrimination\nbased on ethnicity, religion or gender, the transfer of\nterritory between states, or conflicting nationality laws.\nStateless people often lack documentation necessary to\nattend school, open a bank account, get a job, passport or\nmobile phone, or enter government buildings, according to the\nU.N. refugee agency (UNHCR).\nThe 3,500-strong stateless Shona community has been in Kenya\nfor more than 50 years, many of them born and raised there, but\nthey are not recognised as Kenyan nationals and have no official\nstatus in Zimbabwe from where they arrived in the 1960s.\nKapota's children were among 600 young Shona who received\ntheir birth certificates at a ceremony in August, said Wanja\nMunaita, Kenya's UNHCR officer on statelessness.\nAbout 2,000 adults have also applied and are waiting for\ntheir documents to be processed, she added.\nKenya set a precedent two years ago when it awarded\ncitizenship to another stateless group, the Makonde, originally\nfrom Mozambique, ending 80 years of statelessness for its 8,000\npeople.\n\nDISCRIMINATION\nOliver Muregerera, a community leader from the Shona's\nGospel of God Church, said his people have faced widespread\ndiscrimination.\n\"We have a lived a life of poverty and squalor since without\ndocuments (we) cannot secure a good job, own property or access\ncritical government services,\" said Muregerera.\nShumarry Maleon, a government assistant director of\nregistration, said all Shona would be issued with birth\ncertificates.\nBut while this is an important step it does not guarantee\nthe Shona citizenship, a recognition President Uhuru Kenyatta\npromised in 2017.\nKenya has an estimated 18,500 stateless people.\nGeorge Kegoro of the Kenyan Human Rights Commission said the\ncountry could not say it was on course to meet social goals such\nas improved access to education and health while failing to\nrecognise part of its population as citizens.\nKegoro, the charity's executive director, said birth\ncertificates were not enough and it was crucial to keep up\npressure until the community received formal recognition.\n\nBETTER DATA\nKenya hopes to get a clearer picture of its stateless\npopulation when the results of a national census conducted in\nAugust are made public next year.\n\"We have been told that the national census has a provision\nto capture data on stateless people which is important, and\nUNHCR is appealing to all stateless people in Kenya to come out\nand identify themselves during the exercise,\" said the UNHCR's\nMunaita.\nAfrican states have increasingly become aware that\nstatelessness is a major problem.\nA 2017 declaration by the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS), a grouping of 15 countries, highlighted the\npolitical will of its member states to tackle the issue.\nThe African Court on Human and People's Rights ruled in 2018\nthat Tanzania arbitrarily deprived a man of Tanzanian\ncitizenship and ordered the government to update its\nlegislation, potentially paving the way for other countries to\nfollow suit.\n(Reporting by Maina Waruru, editing by Astrid Zweynert, Zoe\nTabary and Emma Batha.

        "text": "By Nita Bhalla\nNAIROBI, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Thousands of\ngay men in Africa are likely dying from HIV-related illnesses\nevery year due to homophobic laws that stifle their chances of\nbeing tested and treated, said researchers behind a study\npublished on Monday in The Lancet HIV journal.\nA study of the data of 45,000 gay men in 28 African\ncountries including Kenya, Malawi and Nigeria found only one in\nfour living with HIV were taking medication.\nHalf had taken an HIV/AIDS test in the past 12 months and\nresearchers said the low rates were due to anti-LGBT+ laws in\nmany African countries, which promoted stigma and discrimination\nand neglected HIV/AIDS programmes targeting gay men.\n\"We found countries that had more repressive anti-LGBT laws\nor harsher penalties for same sex relations had lower levels of\nHIV testing,\" said Kate Mitchell, one of the researchers at\nImperial College London who was involved in the study.\n\"Some of the studies suggested that this was due to stigma.\nMore research is required to see whether, if these laws were\nrepealed, more gay men would be tested and treated.\"\nAccording to the United Nations, about 470,000 people living\nwith HIV in Africa still die every year because they cannot or\ndo not get tested and gain access to treatment, accounting for\nmore than 60 percent of all global HIV-related deaths.\nWhile there are no official figures on the number of deaths\nof men who have sex with men (MSM), Mitchell said it would be\nfair to estimate that thousands of gay men who were unaware or\nunable to get medication were dying every year.\nAfrican countries have some of the world's most prohibitive\nlaws governing homosexuality. Same-sex relationships are\nconsidered taboo and gay sex is a crime across most of\ncontinent, with punishments ranging from imprisonment to death.\nA 2019 report by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,\nTrans and Intersex Association found 32 African countries out of\na total of 54 nations criminalize same sex relations. South\nAfrica is the only African nation to legalise gay marriage.\nGay rights groups say the laws promote homophobia across the\ncontinent and are used daily to persecute and discriminate\nagainst sexual minorities who face prejudice in getting jobs,\nrenting housing or seeking medical care or education.\nHate crimes like blackmail, extortion, physical and sexual\nassault are common - but most are too fearful to go to the\npolice due to their sexual orientation, say rights groups.\n\"Globally, men who have sex with men are about 28 times\nmore likely to be living with HIV than men in the general\npopulation, an inequality that is particularly apparent in\nsub-Saharan Africa, where the human rights of MSM are often\nviolated,\" said the study.\n\"These attitudes also create barriers to implementing\neffective HIV research, policy and health programmes for MSM,\nthrough prohibition of activism and research, arbitrary arrests\nof health-care providers, and disruption of services provided by\ncommunity-based and non-governmental organisations.\"\nLGBT+ rights campaigners in Kenya, where gay sex is\npunishable by up to 14 years in jail, said they were not\nsurprised by the results of the study.\n\"It is true the law makes if very difficult for MSM to seek\nmedical treatment. Many people fear they will be outed or face\nsome kind of abuse or be shamed by insensitive medical\npractitioners,\" said Andrew Maina, programme coordinator at\nHIVOS.\n\"If these anti-gay laws are scrapped, there will be more\nopenness, more advocacy and more awareness of the issue. Gay men\nliving with HIV would be able to seek medical care knowing they\nwill be treated with respect and dignity.\"\n(Reporting by Nita Bhalla @nitabhalla, Editing by Claire\nCozens.

        "text": "(Clarifies description of software tool)\nBy Kagondu Njagi\nILULA, Kenya, Oct 5 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Anyone\nhearing the loud singing coming from Isaac Chereger's farm would\nbe forgiven for thinking it was a particularly enthusiastic\nchurch gathering.\nInstead, it was a group of women calling to order a meeting\nof a local religious charity that teaches villagers how to\nconserve the forest around their homes in this southwestern\nKenya community, to help stop the Mara River from drying.\nFor more than a decade, environmental groups have raised the\nalarm over the Mara River, warning that population growth,\nillegal logging and overuse of its waters by communities\nstruggling through drought have caused a dramatic drop in the\nriver's water levels.\nAt the meeting on Chereger's farm, some villagers\nvolunteered to plant saplings where their fields meet the river,\nwhile others agreed to get training on why the unplanned felling\nof trees along the river could worsen the impact of drought.\nChereger told the Thomson Reuters Foundation he is proud of\nthe conservation work his community does, but has long wondered\nif it was enough.\nThat's why the Empowering Lives International Centre - which\nput on the meeting on his farm - has joined other local\norganisations in an effort to give their traditional\nconservation work some technological muscle.\nThe Stockholm Environment Institute, an international\nresearch organisation, has created a software-based water\nevaluation and planning (WEAP) tool designed to help government\nagencies and project partners better manage water.\nWhen communities know what to expect from the Mara River's\nchanging water levels, they can more quickly adapt and find the\nmost effective ways to slow the drying of the river, the\ninstitute's researchers say.\nThe group in Ilula village say they are keen to add the\nsystem to their conservation toolbelt.\n\"The Mara River gives us pasture and water for our cattle.\nIf this innovation can help in preventing bad use of the river,\nthen we are ready to work with it,\" said Chereger.\nWADING GOATS\nThere are currently no official figures on how much water\nlevels in the Mara River basin, home to about a million people,\nhave dropped over the past few decades.\nBut Nkoinko Siposha, from Oloroito village in the upper\nbasin, recalled that in the 1990s it was impossible for his\ncattle to wade through any part of the river because of its\ndepth.\nThese days, even goats walk leisurely through the drying\nriver to graze on the other side of its shores, the 65-year-old\nherder told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nStarting in the Mau forests, in southwestern Kenya, the Mara\nRiver basin stretches over 13,750 square kilometres (5,300\nsquare miles), through the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya\nand Tanzania's Serengeti plains, before it spills into\nTanzania's Lake Victoria.\nTom Ogol, a former researcher at the Stockholm Environment\nInstitute, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation there are several\nkey threats to the river.\nThey include loss of forests along its shores and\nunsustainable agricultural activity, such as farmers illegally\nsiphoning water from the river for irrigation.\nBoth are \"aggravating what climate change has already\naltered\", with increasingly long droughts now a problem, Ogol\nsaid.\nIn October last year, Rift Valley commissioner George\nNatembeya said the growing number of flower farms cropping up\nalong the river are a problem, with some farmers using\npetrol-powered pumps to suck water fromthe river.\nSuch pumps are restricted in the county due to the pollution\nthey cause.\nAccording to Natembeya, water demand in the Mara River basin\nis over 20 million cubic metres per year, with irrigated\nagriculture accounting for about half of that.\n\"This demand is too much. The river cannot provide it all\nbecause its water sources, which are in the basin, are drying up\ndue to climate change,\" Natembeya said during a press briefing.\nHe then delivered a dire prediction.\n\"The Mara River will be dead in three years,\" he warned.\nREPORTING VIOLATIONS\nTechnology has become a vital tool for protecting the river,\nsaid Emmanuel Nkurunziza, director general of the Nairobi-based\nRegional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development.\nTools such as the WEAP have made it easier for governments\nand partner organisations to detect changes in the Mara's water\nlevel and quality, and helped them reverse or adapt to those\nchanges, he said.\n\"Technology enables the tracking of threats to the Mara\nriver over a period of time. With this it is possible to\nidentify whether these threats are caused by human activities or\nclimate change,\" Nkurunziza told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nOgol described WEAP as a \"user-friendly\" software tool that\ncombines data on rainfall runoff, how surface and ground water\ninteract, and crop water requirements.\nNkurunziza was confident the system would play an important\nrole in tackling climate change threats.\nBut, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, how much the\nsystem will benefit farmers living along the Mara River depends\non the decisions local lawmakers make based on the data.\n\"We might be able to identify what is happening to the Mara\nRiver, but the political circumstances surrounding the causes of\nthe problems might determine whether there is action or not,\" he\nsaid.\n(Reporting by Kagondu Njagi; Editing by Jumana Farouky and\nLaurie Goering.

        "text": "(Reworks and updates with Cate Blanchett quotes)\nBy Emma Batha\nLONDON, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Film star Cate\nBlanchett called on Monday for the world to end the\n\"devastating\" plight of millions of people with no nationality\namid warnings that rising xenophobia is stymieing efforts to\nmeet a 2024 deadline for eradicating statelessness.\nThe double Oscar-winner said statelessness prevented people\nfulfilling their potential, and was a \"heartbreaking\" waste of\nhuman talent.\nBlanchett threw her weight behind the global #Ibelong\ncampaign to end statelessness as she addressed an\nintergovernmental meeting in Geneva aimed at dramatically\nescalating progress.\nHer support will boost attention on an issue that has long\nbeen neglected.\nNot recognised as nationals of any country, stateless people\nare often deprived of basic rights like education and\nhealthcare, and risk exploitation and detention.\nBlanchett held up her own passport, credit card and Medicare\ncard as she urged ministers and government officials to imagine\nhow difficult life would be if they had no documents.\n\"It's a condition of invisibility,\" she said. \"Stateless\npeople are unseen and unheard.\"\nBlanchett, a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. refugee agency\n(UNHCR), interviewed Maha Mamo, a formerly stateless activist\nwho has become a torchbearer for #Ibelong, describing her as an\n\"extraordinary beacon of hope\".\nThe activist, who speaks five languages, told delegates how\nher hopes of studying medicine and joining a Lebanese basketball\nteam were crushed because she had no papers.\nThe Geneva meeting comes halfway through the #Ibelong\ninitiative launched in 2014.\nBut the task ahead is monumental. Only about 200,000 people\nacquired citizenship during the first half of the campaign,\nbarely making a dent in the overall number.\nAnd U.N. officials admit the total may now be even higher\nthan in 2014 because of increasing displacement triggered by\ncrises in Syria, Venezuela and elsewhere, which has raised the\nrisk of many children growing up stateless.\nThere is also no solution in sight for many of the largest\ngroups of stateless people including the Rohingya, hundreds of\nthousands of whom have fled to Bangladesh following an upsurge\nin violence.\nU.N. officials are also keeping a close eye on India, where\n1.9 million people in the northeastern state of Assam have been\nleft off a register of citizens, stoking concerns that many\ncould become stateless.\nUNHCR chief Filippo Grandi said global awareness of the\nrepercussions of statelessness was growing and they had received\nmore than 170 pledges of action ahead of the meeting.\nBut he warned that \"damaging forms of nationalism\" and the\n\"manipulation of anti-refugee and migrant sentiment\" were\nputting progress at risk.\nDOGS HAVE MORE RIGHTS\nPeople end up stateless for a host of reasons including\nmigration, flawed citizenship laws and ethnic discrimination.\nOthers fall through the cracks when countries break up.\nAside from Myanmar, there are big stateless groups in Ivory\nCoast, Thailand, Nepal, Kuwait and some former Soviet countries.\nStateless people have previously told the Thomson Reuters\nFoundation that they feel stigmatised and forgotten.\n\"We've had people telling us, 'dogs are more important than\nI am',\" said Melanie Khanna, head of the UNHCR's statelessness\nsection.\n\"People feel totally scarred and isolated. They often say,\n'I thought it was just me'. It sends chills down your spine.\"\nAlmost all countries are represented at the Geneva meeting,\nwith some 1,000 delegates including a number of ministers. U.N.\nofficials say the pledges will provide a roadmap for\naccelerating the campaign.\nIn July, Kyrgyzstan made history when it became the first\ncountry to officially end statelessness. U.N. officials believe\nTurkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan could also meet the\n2024 deadline.\nThailand, where nearly 479,000 people are stateless,\nincluding members of ethnic hill tribes in the northern border\nregions, is also stepping up action.\nThe issue made international headlines last year during\nrescue efforts to save a young Thai football team trapped in a\nflooded cave.\nDuring the drama it emerged that several of the boys and\ntheir coach were stateless.

        "text": "By Emma Batha\nLONDON, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Film star Cate\nBlanchett will back a global campaign on Monday to end the\nplight of an estimated 10 million people with no nationality\namid warnings rising xenophobia is stymieing efforts to meet a\n2024 deadline for eradicating statelessness.\nThe double Oscar-winner will speak at a major meeting in\nGeneva aimed at persuading governments to dramatically escalate\nprogress in the campaign called #Ibelong.\nBlanchett's attendance will help boost attention on some of\nthe world's most invisible people.\nNot recognised as nationals of any country, stateless people\nare often deprived of basic rights like education and\nhealthcare, and risk exploitation and detention.\nBlanchett will interview Maha Mamo, a formerly stateless\nactivist who has become a torchbearer for #Ibelong.\nAs a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR),\nBlanchett recently visited Bangladesh to meet stateless Rohingya\nwho have fled Myanmar, and has met displaced Syrian families in\nthe Middle East.\nWhen U.N. chief Antonio Guterres launched the #Ibelong\ninitiative in 2014, during his time as head of the UNHCR, he\ndescribed statelessness as a \"cancer\" that must be excised.\nBut the task ahead is monumental. Only about 200,000 people\nacquired citizenship during the first half of the campaign,\nbarely making a dent in the overall number.\nAnd U.N. officials admit the total may now be even higher\nthan in 2014 because of increasing displacement triggered by\ncrises in Syria, Venezuela and elsewhere, which has raised the\nrisk of many children growing up stateless.\nThere is also no solution in sight for many of the largest\ngroups of stateless people including the Rohingya, hundreds of\nthousands of whom have fled to Bangladesh following an upsurge\nin violence.\nExperts on statelessness spoke of \"storm clouds on the\nhorizon\" as forced displacement, xenophobia and populism\ncomplicate efforts to meet the 2024 deadline.\nThey are keeping a close eye on India, where 1.9 million\npeople in the northeastern state of Assam have been left off a\nregister of citizens, stoking concerns that many could become\nstateless.\nDOGS HAVE MORE RIGHTS\nPeople end up stateless for a host of historical, social and\nlegal reasons including migration, flawed citizenship laws and\nethnic discrimination. Others fall through the cracks when\ncountries break up.\nAside from Myanmar, there are big stateless groups in Ivory\nCoast, Thailand, Nepal, Kuwait and some former Soviet countries.\nStateless people have previously told the Thomson Reuters\nFoundation that they feel stigmatised and forgotten.\n\"We've had people telling us, 'dogs are more important than\nI am',\" said Melanie Khanna, head of the UNHCR's statelessness\nsection.\n\"People feel totally scarred and isolated. They often say,\n'I thought it was just me'. It sends chills down your spine.\"\nDespite slow progress on reducing numbers, Khanna said there\nwas far greater global awareness of statelessness than five\nyears ago.\nAlmost all countries will be represented in Geneva, with\nmore than 20 sending ministers. U.N. officials expect\ngovernments to make scores of pledges which will provide a\nroadmap for accelerating the campaign.\nIn July, Kyrgyzstan made history when it became the first\ncountry to officially end statelessness. U.N. officials believe\nTurkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan could also meet the\n2024 deadline.\nThailand, where nearly 479,000 people are stateless,\nincluding members of ethnic hill tribes in the northern border\nregions, is also stepping up action.\nThe issue made international headlines last year during\nrescue efforts to save a young Thai football team trapped in a\nflooded cave.\nDuring the drama it emerged that several of the boys and\ntheir coach were stateless. They were granted citizenship after\ntheir ordeal.\n\nWIN-WIN\nBut resolving statelessness is not just a human rights\nissue. Statelessness has fuelled conflict and displacement in\nboth Myanmar and Ivory Coast.\nKhanna said there was a growing recognition that resolving\nstatelessness was a \"win-win\" because it was in governments'\ninterests to have everybody feel invested in the society they\nlive in and motivated to contribute.\nThe U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of\nglobal pledges on tackling poverty, inequality and other ills\nwith an overall ambition to \"to leave no one behind\", have\nhelped shift attitudes, Khanna said.\n\"The SDGs have allowed us to talk about this whole area as a\ndevelopment issue and not just a human rights one,\" she added.\n\"This makes a lot of sense because you don't want\ndisenfranchised, impoverished people on your territory.\"\nKhanna said an increasing number of countries were changing\ntheir nationality laws and policies to prevent future\ngenerations ending up in limbo.\nColombia, for example, has announced it will give\ncitizenship to thousands of children born to Venezuelan migrants\nto prevent them growing up stateless.\nOther countries have scrapped discriminatory laws that\nprevent women passing their citizenship to their children - a\nmajor cause of statelessness.\nThe impact of such laws has been clearly seen during the\nSyrian war with many displaced mothers unable to obtain\ndocuments for their children where the father is dead or absent.\nIran became the latest country to pass reforms last week - a\nmove human rights experts believe could help thousands of\nchildren obtain citizenship.\nThere has also been a flurry of countries joining the U.N.\nconventions on preventing and eliminating statelessness.\nThe 1961 convention stipulates that a state must grant\nnationality to anyone born on its territory who would otherwise\nbe stateless - a safeguard that would wipe-out most new cases of\nstatelessness if adopted by all countries.\n\"Statelessness causes devastating and totally unnecessary\ndamage,\" Khanna said.\n\"But solutions aren't complicated. The biggest obstacle is\npolitical will.\"\n(Reporting by Emma Batha @emmabatha; Editing by Claire Cozens.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

        "text": "By Emma Batha\nLONDON, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - As a teenager\ngrowing up in Lebanon Maha Mamo lived in constant terror of\ncheckpoints, but her only crime was to be born stateless.\nWith no documents to prove who she was, Mamo feared she\ncould be arrested and locked up indefinitely.\nLike other stateless people, she was deprived of basic\nrights most people take for granted.\nEverything from going to school or getting a job to even\nenjoying a night out with friends was fraught with difficulties.\nOn Monday, Mamo will tell her story to film star Cate\nBlanchett at the opening of a major intergovernmental meeting on\nstatelessness in Geneva.\nCharismatic, down-to-earth and fluent in five languages,\nMamo has become a powerful voice in #Ibelong, a campaign to\neradicate statelessness which is estimated to affect about 10\nmillion people worldwide.\n\"For most people a passport is a travel document, but for me\nit means everything,\" said Mamo, who became a Brazilian national\nlast year and now speaks at international events draped in a\nBrazilian flag.\n\"It means I exist. It's finally a sign I belong somewhere.\"\n\n'MASSIVE IMPACT'\nMamo's fate was sealed before she was born when her\nChristian father and Muslim mother fell in love in Syria.\nInterfaith marriages were banned so they eloped to neighbouring\nLebanon where she, her sister Souad and brother Eddy were born.\n\"You can only be Lebanese if your father is Lebanese, and we\ncouldn't be Syrian because our parents' marriage was illegal, so\nwe grew up stateless,\" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\"It has had a massive impact all my life. I had many\nchallenges every day. I was afraid of every single thing.\"\nMamo was rejected by many schools before eventually being\naccepted by an Armenian school which took pity on the family.\nA talented basketball player, she was scouted by\nprofessional coaches who believed she had potential to play on\nthe national team - until they realised she had no documents.\n\"That was when my world came crashing down,\" she said. \"This\nwas the first moment when the deprivations really hit home. But\nas a teenager I didn't yet understand how big my problem was.\"\nDespite good school grades, her applications to study\nmedicine at university were also rejected.\nHealth care was another obstacle. To get urgent hospital\ntreatment for a severe allergy Mamo was forced to pretend to be\nher best friend.\nWith no papers, even the most mundane things became a\nlogistical nightmare.\n\"There are simple things you would never imagine that are so\nimpossible; buying a sim card, getting a loan, having a library\ncard or even going to a club to dance with your friends or\ncelebrate a birthday,\" she said.\n\"If they ask for ID you have to give up and go home.\"\nIn Lebanon, there was the added danger posed by checkpoints.\n\"If the police stop you then you are going to jail just\nbecause you don't have documents,\" she said.\n\"Every time I saw one I had to run the other way just\nbecause my existence itself was illegal.\"\n\nNEW BEGINNING\nDesperate for a solution to her predicament, Mamo sent her\nstory to presidents, ministers and any organisation she thought\nmight be able to help - and was met with a wall of silence.\nBut in 2014 Brazil offered to take Mamo and her siblings\nunder a new humanitarian visa programme it had launched to help\nSyrians fleeing war.\n\"I went to Brazil not as a stateless person, but as a\nrefugee. I only knew two things about Brazil - the football and\nthe carnival,\" said Mamo, now 31 and fluent in Portuguese.\nHer arrival in Brazil coincided with the launch of the\nUnited Nations' #Ibelong campaign aimed at ending statelessness\nin a decade.\n\"For me, my brother and sister that was the hope. In 10\nyears we would have the chance to be a person, a human being,\"\nsaid Mamo.\nBut she did not have to wait that long. In 2017, Brazil\nchanged its law to recognise stateless people and provide a\nroute to naturalisation.\nLast year Mamo and her sister became the first stateless\npeople in Brazil to be granted citizenship.\nMamo, who is writing a book about her life, recalls vividly\nthe moment when she was presented with her Brazilian passport -\nending 30 years in limbo.\n\"I started shaking and crying,\" she said. \"I did not believe\nwhat was happening, that this was my moment when I'm born again\nand my life would totally change.\"\nHowever, the ceremony was bittersweet because her brother\ncould not share in her joy.\nJust weeks after being granted asylum in Brazil, Eddy had\nbeen killed in a street robbery.\n\"I couldn't make his dream come true, I couldn't make him a\ncitizen of this world,\" said Mamo. \"He died a stateless person.\"\n(Reporting by Emma Batha @emmabatha; Editing by Claire Cozens.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

        "text": "By Belinda Goldsmith and Sarah  Shearman\nADDIS ABABA/SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 23 (Thomson Reuters\nFoundation) - A s the brains behind a hydroponics farming system\nin rural Kenya, 17-year-old Jefferson Kang'acha struggled to get\nnoticed but he now expects the youth climate movement led by\nGreta Thunberg to bolster other young people on a mission.\nKang'acha, a computer technology student, decided to apply\ntechnology to farming when his parents were hit by another\ndrought and he came up with an automated hydroponics unit built\nfrom recycled waste and plastic bottles.\nAfter his first unit produced 2 tonnes of tomatoes, he\nfounded the Eden Horticultural Hub, a social enterprise that now\nruns four hydroponics systems in his home town of Limuru to\nsupply the local community and lunches to 1,500 school pupils.\nEchoing many young social entrepreneurs attending two of the\nsector's big annual events this week, Kang'acha said he was\nbrushed off at first but eventually - similarly to Swedish\nteenager Thunberg - people started to listen.\n\"At first it was hard to be heard, particularly as the\naverage age of a farmer in Kenya is about 60,\" said Kang'acha,\nnow 20, speaking on the sidelines of the 12th annual Social\nEnterprise World Forum (SEWF) in Ethiopia.\n\"But young people have the advantage of exposure to\ntechnology and can bring solutions to old problems, working\ntogether with the experience of older people, not as rivals.\"\nA Thomson Reuters Foundation poll released this week found\nthere was rising enthusiasm among young people globally to work\nfor businesses with a mission to do social good.\nThree in four of about 900 experts surveyed said more young\npeople - under the age of 25 - were interested in working in\nsocial enterprises, which tackle a host of issues, from\nhealthcare to climate change.\n\nJOBS WITH MEANING\n\"We don't just want jobs, we want meaningful jobs,\" said\nSabrina Chakori, 27, who set up a \"tool library\" in Brisbane in\nAustralia in 2017 that charges an annual membership fee to\nborrow donated tools, camping equipment and sports gear.\n\"The current economic system does not work for the majority\nof us and we are starting to look at new economic systems,\" she\nsaid, adding the library not only used equipment filling up\nlandfills but also cut consumerism.\nAs well as concerns about the global economy and climate\nchange, young entrepreneurs said a lack of jobs and worries\nabout affording their own homes weighed on their generation.\nHaving previously worked for a Wall Street hedge fund, New\nYorker Bree Jones decided to use her skills to help people so\nfounded Parity, a social enterprise that converts abandoned\nhomes in Baltimore into affordable ones.\nJones, 28, said younger generations have been spurred on by\nthe \"existential threats\" they face, from mass incarceration,\npolice brutality and maternal mortality rates afflicting black\npeople in the United States, to issues like climate breakdown.\n\"For me it was about using my college education and career\nskill set and bringing that back into my community in a way that\nlifts my community,\" Jones told the Thomson Reuters Foundation\nat the sidelines of SOCAP in San Francisco.\n\"We realise we have been extracting so much from the earth\nwithout replenishing and that is not sustainable \u2013 we can do\nbusiness, make a profit, make money, but also give back to our\ncustomers, community and the environment.\"\nA Deloitte report on the rise of social enterprise in 2018\nhighlighted that for the first time in mature markets, young\npeople believe their lives will be worse than their parents.\nThis was making them question corporate behaviour and the\neconomic and social principles that guide it, with 86% of\nmillennials saying business success should be measured in terms\nof more than just financial performance.\nAt the same time, technological advances were opening up new\nopportunities for businesses to positively impact society.\nEllen Chilemba, 25, a DJ and founder of Tiwale, a\ncommunity-based organisation set up in 2012 to give microloans,\ntraining and school grants to women and girls in Malawi, said\npeople were starting to take young people more seriously.\n\"For us, our future is not as visible as for older\ngenerations,\" said Chilemba at the SEWF, pointing to the global\nclimate movement spurred by Thunberg.\n\"It is time for movements and not just individual efforts.\"\n(Reporting by Belinda Goldsmith and Sarah Shearman; Editing by\nLyndsay Griffiths.

Its data will also be made publicly available through\nonline monitoring service Global Forest Watch.\nRosenbarger told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the ability\nto gather 10 major market players to work with the new platform\n\"has a lot of potential for impact\".\n\"The main thing was how we can get more reliable information\nquicker to help have faster follow-up on the ground so we can\nintervene where deforestation is happening,\" she added.\nThe online platform will highlight patches in concessions\nand protected areas suffering tree loss and deforestation.\nAs well as alerting companies to where action is needed,\ngovernments and conservation groups can also use the information\nto hold businesses linked to those areas accountable.\nThe palm oil and consumer goods firms in the project - which\nare already receiving alerts and giving feedback - are Bunge,\nCargill, Golden Agri-Resources, Mondelez, Musim Mas Group,\nNestle, PepsiCo, Sime Darby Plantation, Unilever and Wilmar.\nMany high-profile palm oil buyers have committed to zero\ndeforestation and to source only sustainable oil by 2020,\nalthough some are likely to miss their targets.\n\"We are committed to developing a range of technologies that\nwill enhance and accelerate our efforts to address potential\nissues within our supply chain,\" Petra Meekers, head of\nsustainable sourcing at Unilever, said in a statement. \"Better\nradar monitoring is an essential piece of this puzzle.\"\n(Reporting by Michael Taylor @MickSTaylor; editing by Megan\nRowling.

MAYA BAY, THAILAND: The island cove was made famous by\nthe 2000 film \"The Beach\" starring Leonardo DiCaprio. It was\nclosed to tourists last year until 2021 in a bid to salvage the\narea's coral reefs, which have been damaged by warmer\ntemperatures and a flood of tourists.\n\n2. BORACAY ISLAND, THE PHILIPPINES: The resort was closed\nfor a six-month cleanup from April to October 2018 after being\ndescribed as a \"cesspool\" by President Rodrigo Duterte. The\nisland attracted 2 million visitors the previous year but has\nnow limited numbers to 19,000 per day and banned beach parties,\nsmoking and drinking.\n\n3. MOUNT EVEREST BASE CAMP, CHINA: The Chinese government\nclosed its side of the Everest base camp this year to anyone\nwithout a climbing permit due to the huge amounts of rubbish\npiling up at the site, according to the Lonely Planet travel\nwebsite. The Chinese base camp, located in Tibet, was accessible\nby car.\n\n4. FJADRARGLJUFUR CANYON, ICELAND: The popular site, which\nfeatured in one of Justin Bieber's music videos, was closed to\ntourists for about three months this year due to damage from wet\nweather and foot traffic. The number of visitors had nearly\ndoubled after being featured in the pop singer's \"I'll Show You\"\nvideo.\n\n5. THE FAROE ISLANDS, DENAMRK: Ten popular tourists sites\nwere closed temporarily this year for maintenance by an\ninternational team of volunteers after a 10% growth in visitor\nnumbers in recent years.\n\n6. SIPADAN ISLAND, MALAYSIA: One of the world's most\nrenowned scuba diving spots on Malaysia's part of Borneo island\nwill be shut for a month every December from 2020 to allow the\ncoral and marine ecosystem to recuperate.\n\n7. KOMODO ISLAND, INDONESIA: Authorities are due to limit\nvisitor numbers and raise entry prices to the island in order to\nconserve the population of the Komodo dragons, the world's\nlargest living species of lizard. Officials initially planned to\nclose the island for one year from 2020 but later scrapped the\nidea.\n\n8. SPANISH STEPS, ITALY: Rome banned tourists from sitting\non the famous monument in August, in a crackdown on overcrowding\nby tourists. Visitors can still walk up and down, but offenders\nof the sitting ban can be fined up to 400 euros ($444).\nThe site was largely shut between October 2015 and September\n2016 for a private restoration after the 135 steps had become\nloose, stained and cracked under the strain of daily use by both\nresidents and visitors.\n\nSource: Thomson Reuters Foundation, Reuters, New Straits\nTimes, Lonely Planet\n($1 = 0.9001 euros)\n(Writing by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi; Editing by Michael Taylor.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

They should be a part of urban planning,\"\nSutanudjaja told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nResidents, many of whom have lived there for generations,\nhave valuable knowledge of disaster preparedness, flood\nmitigation and other risks linked to climate change, she said.\n\"Kampungs are living spaces with problems with sanitation\nand housing that reduce their resilience, so we also don't want\nto romanticise them. But demolition is not an answer,\" she said.\nThere is also risk attached to success: George Town on\nPenang island, off Malaysia's west coast, is a UNESCO world\nheritage site that is hugely popular with tourists that many\nresidents blame for congestion and higher rents.\nUnder-pressure cities need a conservation approach when\nmodernising, which includes residents to keeps alive traditional\nknowledge and cultures such as foods, clothing and music, said\nSaswat Bandyopadhyay, an urban planning professor at CEPT\nUniversity in Ahmedabad, India.\n\"The loss of heritage is irreversible - once it's gone, it's\ngone. So we must be doing everything we can to preserve it.\"\n(Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Michael\nTaylor.

Under-Secretary-General Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana\nsaid at an urban conference in Penang.\n\"Fast-evolving technologies have the potential to transform\nthe traditional way of doing things across all government\nfunctions and domains,\" she said, adding that public-private\npartnerships will be key.\nWorldwide, the rise of cloud-computing and artificial\nintelligence (AI) technologies have led to data-gathering\nstreetlights in China, autonomous buses in Singapore and facial\nrecognition systems in Indian airports.\nAI, which includes machine-learning, autonomous and data\nprocessing systems, is currently being used in crime prevention,\ntrademark applications and to improve crop yields, according to\na U.N. study https://www.unescap.org/publications/artificial-intelligence-delivery-public-services\nreleased this week.\nBut the increased use of data, and of systems such as facial\nrecognition software and closed-circuit television have also\nsparked concerns over bias, security, privacy and surveillance.\nWith systems of social assistance increasingly being driven\nby data and technologies, there is \"a grave risk of stumbling\nzombie-like into a digital welfare dystopia\", said Philip\nAlston, the U.N. special rapporteur on poverty and human rights.\nThis is \"especially problematic when the private sector is\ntaking a leading role in designing, constructing, and even\noperating significant parts of the digital welfare state\",\nAlston warned in a report last week.\nTechnology companies operate in an almost \"human rights-free\nzone\", he added.\nGovernments can guard against this by putting in adequate\nsafeguards, and ensuring that there is good planning and\ngovernance, said Lim Teng Leng, deputy director at the\nSingaporean government's Centre for Liveable Cities.\nTechnology-based solutions are no panacea for city problems,\nand can often cause just as many problems as they set out to\naddress, he said.\n\"Smart Cities cannot be a measure of how advanced the\ntechnologies are, but how these technologies are used to solve\nproblems,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\"People have to believe that all this data will improve\ntheir lives, make their cities better and safer. The government\nmust build trust by being upfront about what data they are\ncollecting, what it is for, and admit when there are mistakes.\"\nThis is particularly relevant to poorer residents and those\nwho are not tech-savvy and may be excluded, said Colin Fernandes\nat the Global Disaster Preparedness Center, a unit of the\nAmerican Red Cross.\n\"Data collection often misses those in informal settlements,\nwho are usually the most vulnerable to disasters and climate\nchange risks, and most in need of welfare benefits and other\nassistance,\" he said.\n\"There is a failure to collect data, or a reluctance on\ntheir part to give up data, because they don't know whether the\ndata will be used to evict them or protect them. They need to be\nassured of what they are signing up for.\"\n(Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Michael\nTaylor.

        "text": "By Rina Chandran\nPENANG, Malaysia, Oct 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -\nU rban planners in rapidly expanding Asian cities must involve\nthe poorest residents in decision-making and include informal\nspaces if they are serious about tackling inequality,\ndevelopment experts said on Wednesday.\nMore than 2.3 billion people in Asia-Pacific live in cities,\nand that number is expected to reach nearly 3.5 billion in 2050,\naccording to the United Nations.\nBut one-third of urban dwellers live in slums or slum-like\nconditions and are under constant threat of eviction as planners\nand authorities look to modernise cities, said Elisa Sutanudjaja\nat the Rujak Center for Urban Studies, a Jakarta think tank.\n\"Cities in Asia are largely a mix of formality and\ninformality, but urban planning is never neutral: it's all\nformal vs informal, legal vs illegal,\" she said on the sidelines\nof a U.N. urban conference in Penang.\n\"But the right to city is far more than individual liberty\nto access urban resources and livelihoods; it is also about\ninformality and community.\"\nThis year, a majority of Asia-Pacific's population for the\nfirst time became urban, with more than half the population\nliving in cities, according to a U.N. report published earlier\nthis week.\nWith growing pressure on resources such as land and water,\nthe region is struggling to make \"effective planning systems a\ncornerstone of national policy\", said Maimunah Mohd Sharif,\nexecutive director of UN-Habitat, the human settlements agency.\nCities in the region that are ranked high for liveability,\nincluding Singapore, and those in Australia, Japan and South\nKorea have co-produced solutions with citizens, she said.\n\"Bridging the digital divide, engaging the urban poor, and\nbuilding climate resilience must be a priority. We have to\nensure equitable distribution of resources,\" said Sharif, a\nformer town planner and mayor of Penang island, off Malaysia's\nwest coast.\nBut increasingly, planners are ignoring the poorest and most\nvulnerable residents including slum dwellers and street vendors,\nsaid Renu Khosla, director of the Centre for Urban & Regional\nExcellence in New Delhi.\n\"Our cities are not being planned for the poor. But when\ncities are planned without people in mind, you get more informal\nsettlements, you get more inequality,\" she told the Thomson\nReuters Foundation.\n\"Perhaps it's time to move away from territorial and\nland-based planning, and plan around people and their needs.\"\nFrom Bangkok to Manila, as Asian cities strive to become\nmore modern, street vendors and hawkers are viewed increasingly\nas a hindrance to city planning and are being evicted from\npavements.\nBut public spaces are for the good of all members of the\npublic and must be legally available to everyone, said\nChidchanok Samantrakul at WIEGO, a global non-profit that helps\ninformal workers.\n\"Half the city is informal - informal settlers, street\nvendors - yet planners only focus on the formal. But there has\nto be opportunity for everyone to co-exist,\" she said.\nSeveral cities in the region are now using Minecraft, a\nvideo game that allows players to build their own worlds using\nvirtual Lego-like pieces, to get communities to participate in\nupgrading their common spaces, under a UN-Habitat programme.\nIn the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi, where women and girls\noften face harassment on the streets and on public transport,\nMinecraft was used to identify safety issues and make public\nspaces safer, said Thu Dao Thi Bao of non-profit Plan\nInternational.\n\"Technology helps give girls and women a voice.

        "text": "(Repeats for clients in Asia.)\nBy Tom Allard\nBANGKOK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - He is Asia\u2019s most-wanted man. He\nis protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private\njet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night\nat a Macau casino.\nTse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected\nof leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate\nformed out of an alliance of five of Asia\u2019s triad groups,\naccording to law enforcement officials. Its members call it\nsimply \u201cThe Company.\u201d Police, in a nod to one of Tse\u2019s\nnicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for \u201cBrother Number\nThree.\u201d\nThe syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of\nmethamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen\ncountries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South\nPacific. But meth \u2013 a highly addictive drug with devastating\nphysical and mental effects on long-term users \u2013 is its main\nbusiness, they say.\nIn what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations\nOffice on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s\nmeth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be\nas high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the\ncartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a\n40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has\nexpanded at least fourfold in the past five years.\nThis unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an\nunprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the\nprime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously\nunreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the\nAustralian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about\n20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far\nthe biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug\ntrafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in\nthe investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar,\nChina, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan,\nwhile not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the\ninvestigation.\nA document containing AFP profiles of the operation\u2019s top 19\nsyndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the\nleader of the syndicate. According to the document, the\norganization has \u201cbeen connected with or directly involved in at\nleast 13 cases\u201d of drug trafficking since January 2015. The\ndocument does not provide specific details of the cases.\nA Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the\n\u201cMultinational CEO\u201d of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement\nAdministration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional\ngovernment agencies says Tse is \u201cbelieved to be\u201d the leader of\nthe Sam Gor syndicate.\nPolice have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected\nboss of the trafficking group.\nSome investigators say that the scope of the syndicate\u2019s\noperation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin\nAmerica\u2019s most legendary narco-traffickers. \u201cTse Chi Lop is in\nthe league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,\u201d said Jeremy\nDouglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC.\n\u201cThe word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no\ndoubt it applies here.\u201d\nReuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to\nquestions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan\u2019s Ministry\nof Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on\ninvestigations.\nDuring the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific\nto uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This\nincluded interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement\nofficials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence\nreports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings\nand other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in\nMyanmar\u2019s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia\u2019s Golden\nTriangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing\ndrugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited\nthe Thai compound of one of the syndicate\u2019s alleged drug lords.\nWhat emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly\ntransnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the\nAFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often\nrefer to as \u201cT1\u201d - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong,\nMacau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.\nThe syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and\nsophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin\nAmerican cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies\na bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a\nmore diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels\ndo, including Japan\u2019s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic\nChinese gangs across Southeast Asia.\nThe crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled\noutbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police\nsay. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked\nrivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a\nunited pursuit of gargantuan profits.\n\u201cThe crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate\nwith seamless efficiency,\u201d says one veteran Western anti-drugs\nofficial. \u201cThey function like a global corporation.\u201d\nLike most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed,\nthe investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.\nIn addition to the contrasts between their drug operations,\nthere\u2019s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop\nand Joaquin \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed\nMexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine\ntrafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their\nextravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has\nbeen revealed about Tse\u2019s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug\nlords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.\n\nA TRIP, A TRAP\nTse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern\nChina, and grew up during China\u2019s Cultural Revolution. Amid the\nbloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group\nof imprisoned members of Mao\u2019s Red Guard in the southern city of\nGuangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big\nCircle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police,\nand like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong\nKong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their\ncriminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.\nIn the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong,\nMacau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based\nin Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling\nring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless\nopium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand,\nChina and Laos meet.\nIn 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on\ndrug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New\nYork. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into\nAmerica, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over\nhis head.\nThrough a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged\nfor leniency.\nHis ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His\n12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed.\nIf freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed\n\u201cgreat sorrow\u201d for his crime, court records show.\nThe entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to\nnine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional\ninstitution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.\nAfter he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to\nCanada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for\nthe next four years. It\u2019s unclear when Tse returned to his old\nhaunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife\nregistered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company\nLtd, in Hong Kong in 2011.\nPolice suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He\n\u201cpicked up where he left off,\u201d said the senior AFP investigator.\nTse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and\nthe Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved\nirresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his\ndrug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no\nextra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.\nHis policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for\nbusiness, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011,\nAFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and\nmeth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather\nthan arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under\nsurveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely\nfor more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug\ncell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They\nwanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.\nThe syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other\ndrug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and\nselling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the\nsyndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the\nMelbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police\nwatched the Australian meet two men.\nOne of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted\nhair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese\nfamily man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance\nshowed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal\nsecurity. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of\nThai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eight\nworked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as\npart of his security protocol.\nTse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts\nand five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in\nprivate jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand\nfor a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt,\naccording to a member of the task force investigating the\nsyndicate.\nTse was a frequent visitor to Asia\u2019s casinos and fond of\nbetting on horses, especially on English races. \u201cWe believe he\nlost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the\ntables in Macau,\u201d said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.\nAs the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected\nthat the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia\nwith meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA,\ncommonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the\nSam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say,\nwhen a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of\nwhite powder strapped to each of his thighs.\n\n\u2018ALADDIN\u2019S CAVE OF INTEL\u2019\nCai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the\nairport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It\nwas the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous,\npicking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said\na former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation.\n\u201cHis hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,\u201d the\ncommander told Reuters. \u201cMethamphetamine is very toxic.\u201d\nCai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs\nwas a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful\ntranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. \u201cWe were very\nfortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,\u201d the\ncommander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been\nmonitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police\nhad no idea who he was.\nCai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a\n\u201cpesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,\u201d according to\nMyanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A\nfriend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father.\nCai\u2019s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for\nketamine at the airport, the commander said.\nUnimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight.\nThe next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport.\nOne recognized him from surveillance work he\u2019d been conducting.\nStill, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they\nlater found on one of his phones might have explained his\nsilence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least\nthree assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch\nand electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said\none investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy\nsaying \u201cLoyalty to the Heavens.\u201d The banner was a \u201ctriad-related\nsign,\u201d he added.\nThe tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed\nthe video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat\nbecause he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a\nlaw enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of\nthe victim\u2019s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad\nmembers were sending a message about the price of disloyalty,\nthe officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.\nThe torture videos were just one of the items allegedly\nfound in Cai\u2019s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was\na diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate\u2019s activities, but\nsloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones,\npolice say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media\nconversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.\nThey were \u201can Aladdin\u2019s Cave of intel,\u201d said one AFP\ncommander based in North Asia.\nFor at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly\ntravelled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for\nthe syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the\nDrug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its\ninvestigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip\nfrom an international courier company recording the delivery of\ntwo consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf\nChinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea\npackets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had\nbeen cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.\nTwo days after Cai\u2019s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon\naddress, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That\nevening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon\njetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so,\nMyanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but\nother than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate,\nincluding couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.\nThen came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery\nof photos and videos on Cai\u2019s phones, an AFP investigator based\nin Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing\nhe had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier.\n\u201cThis one stuck out because it was Canadian,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI\nsaid: \u2018Fuck, I know who you are!'\u201d\nIt was Tse Chi Lop.\nThe Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of\nintelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work\non Cai\u2019s phones.\nAustralia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime\ngangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade,\nthe AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and\nsmall, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent\ndescribed the database, which includes a trove of names,\nchemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and\nsurveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence\non Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.\nThe AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai\u2019s\nphones with the database. They discovered photos related to\nthree big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in\nChina, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators\nand Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese\nanti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and\naddresses in Cai\u2019s phones to other meth busts in China.\nFor regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations\nupended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by\ndifferent crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the\nwork of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics\nagent said they believed Cai was \u201cone of the members of a\nmega-syndicate,\u201d which had been involved in multiple \u201cdrugs\ncases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.\u201d\nCai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still\nin jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking\ncharges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to\ncontact Cai\u2019s lawyer.\n\nMETH PARADISE\nDuring his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing\nthe country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and\nobtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a\nbigger vessel in international waters, according to police and\nthe Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures\nof the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where\nthe meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.\nThe police reconstruction of Cai\u2019s dealings in Myanmar led\nto another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production\nhad shifted from China\u2019s southern provinces to Shan State in\nMyanmar\u2019s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had\nprovided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor\ningredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were\nsmuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in\nthe Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the\nfreedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.\nArmed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan\nState have long controlled large tracts of territory and used\ndrug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the\nmilitary. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar\ngovernment with rebel groups over the years has brought relative\ncalm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to\nflourish.\n\u201cProduction facilities can be hidden from law enforcement\nand other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,\u201d\nanalyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the\nInternational Crisis Group. \u201cDrug production and profits are now\nso vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.\u201d\nThe Myanmar government and police did not respond to\nquestions from Reuters.\nAlong the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there\nis evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts\na deep ravine known as the \u201cValley of Death,\u201d where ethnic\nKachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for\ndecades with Myanmar\u2019s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past\ntrucks carrying building materials and workers.\nThe Kaung Kha militia\u2019s immaculate and expansive new\nheadquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green\nhills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers\naway, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved\nout of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned\nout vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba\ntablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine.\nWhen it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more\nthan 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg\nof caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances\nused in drug production.\nThe Loikan facility was \u201cvery likely\u201d to have been the\nsource of much of the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s meth, said the\nYangon-based AFP officer.\n\u201cSome militia were involved in the lab,\u201d said Oi Khun, a\ncommunications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia,\nin an interview. He paused, then added: \u201cBut not with the\nknowledge of senior members\u201d of the militia.\nOne person in Loikan described how workers from the lab\nwould come down from the hills. The men, like most of the\nvillagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the\nlocals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.\n\u201cI asked them once. \u2018Why don\u2019t you bathe?\u2019\u201d the person said.\n\u201cThey said they did, but there was nothing they could do about\nthe smell.\u201d\nThe rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the\nskin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature\nstench might reveal their illicit activities. \u201cWe all knew,\u201d the\nperson said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t talk about it. That just brings you\ndanger.\u201d\nMeth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals,\nsay Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network\u2019s\ncouriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the\nAsia-Pacific.\nShan\u2019s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the\nworld, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told\nReuters. \u201cThey can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the\nground and let it dry.\u201d\nThe UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth\nis worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business\nmodel for meth is \u201cvery different\u201d to heroin, said the UNODC\u2019s\nDouglas. \u201cInputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not\nneeded, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore\nfar, far higher.\u201d\nThe wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in\nnortheastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a\nUNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control\nCommission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to\nthe UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand,\n$298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the\nJapanese market, that\u2019s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.\nThe money the syndicate is making \u201cmeans that if they lose\nten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,\u201d\nsaid the Chinese counter-narcotics official. \u201cThey can afford\nfailure. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u2018MONEY, MONEY\u2019\nThe analysis of Cai\u2019s phones was continuing to provide\nleads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the\npick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with\nMyanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at\nsea for weeks.\nOne of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the\nShun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement\ndocument reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea\nwhen, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a\nmarine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and\npaid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV\nValkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s\nand hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea\nsickness tablets. According to local media, he didn\u2019t have a\nfishing license at the time.\nAfter buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on\na course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in\nthe Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the\nrendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western\nAustralian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was\nseen \u201cunloading a lot of packages\u201d into a van, the commander\nsaid.\n\u201cWe knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of\norganized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and\ncomes back with some gear on it, that it hasn\u2019t just dropped\nfrom the sky in the middle of the ocean.\u201d\nInvestigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car\nhire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug\ntraffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say,\nthat some of Smith\u2019s alleged co-conspirators were members of an\nethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and\nComanchero motorcycle gangs, known as \u201cbikies\u201d in Australia.\nAs they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of\ncrystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor\nsyndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy\nof an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians\nreconvened in Perth a month later.\nBikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and\na self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had\nrefined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star\nhotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police\ninvestigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants,\nsaid the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth.\nThe restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that\nincluded caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.\nOn November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again,\nthis time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the\nAndaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth\nfrom Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast\nof the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the\nIndian Ocean.\nThe Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.\nWhen the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in\ninternational waters off the West Australian coast on December\n19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting \u201cmoney, money,\u201d\naccording to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De\nMan\u2019s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith\nand his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved\ntheir identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by\nthe crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.\nThe Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of\nGeraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The\nmen unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of\nthe AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault\nweapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty\nto importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of\nhis alleged associates are still on trial.\nTaiwan\u2019s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it\nhad \u201cworked together with our counterparts on the investigation\u201d\nof the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the \u201csubstantial\nseizure of illicit narcotics\u201d by the Australian authorities in\nDecember 2017. The bureau said it was \u201caware that Taiwanese\nsyndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in\n(the) Asia-Pacific region,\u201d and was working \u201ccollaboratively and\nclosely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and\ncross-border drug trafficking.\u201d\n\nNIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED\nAs the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police\nconcluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone\na kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the\nthree biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the\n1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The\nother two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse\u2019s original triad, and the\nBamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator,\nthe syndicate\u2019s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that\nit \u201cmust rival Apple\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cThe syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market\nto tap,\u201d said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior\ncolonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade.\n\u201cThe power this network possesses is unimaginable.\u201d\nInvestigators have had wins. In February last year, police\nbusted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough\ntea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66\nwas intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than\none tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor\nlieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar.\nIn December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected\nsyndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.\nLocated near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed\ncompound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used\nto experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a\n100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to\nthe back of the property.\nSue wasn\u2019t there, but property and money from 38 bank\naccounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized\nduring the investigation. Sue is still at large.\nBut the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the\nwider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal\nmeth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and\nSoutheast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in\nmost countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising\nseizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019,\n\u201csuggested the supply of the drug had expanded.\u201d\nIn the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive\nadversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug\nmotherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product\nin shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth\ncoming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the\nsyndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This\nincluded deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each\ncontaining about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on\nnarrow jungle paths.\nOver the years, police have had little success in taking\ndown Asia\u2019s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders\nhave been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to\nthe AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics\nkingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than\na short period was in the mid-1970s. That\u2019s when Ng Sik-ho, a\nwily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced\nto 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium\nand morphine, according to court records.\nSo far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho\u2019s fate. He is being\ntracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say\ncounter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they\nbelieve he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.\n(Reporting by Tom Allard. Additional reporting by Reuters\nStaff. Editing by Peter Hirschberg.)",

        "text": "By Tom Allard\nBANGKOK (Reuters) - He is Asia\u2019s most-wanted man. He is protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private jet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night at a Macau casino.\nTse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected of leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate formed out of an alliance of five of Asia\u2019s triad groups, according to law enforcement officials. Its members call it simply \u201cThe Company.\u201d Police, in a nod to one of Tse\u2019s nicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for \u201cBrother Number Three.\u201d\nThe syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of methamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen countries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South Pacific. But meth \u2013 a highly addictive drug with devastating physical and mental effects on long-term users \u2013 is its main business, they say.\nIn what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s meth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be as high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the cartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a 40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has expanded at least fourfold in the past five years.\nThis unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an unprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the prime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously unreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the Australian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about 20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far the biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug trafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in the investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar, China, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan, while not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the investigation.\nA document containing AFP profiles of the operation\u2019s top 19 syndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the leader of the syndicate. According to the document, the organization has \u201cbeen connected with or directly involved in at least 13 cases\u201d of drug trafficking since January 2015. The document does not provide specific details of the cases.\nA Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the \u201cMultinational CEO\u201d of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional government agencies says Tse is \u201cbelieved to be\u201d the leader of the Sam Gor syndicate.\nPolice have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected boss of the trafficking group.\nSome investigators say that the scope of the syndicate\u2019s operation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin America\u2019s most legendary narco-traffickers. \u201cTse Chi Lop is in the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,\u201d said Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC. \u201cThe word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no doubt it applies here.\u201d\nReuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to questions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on investigations.\nDuring the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific to uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This included interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement officials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence reports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings and other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in Myanmar\u2019s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia\u2019s Golden Triangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing drugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited the Thai compound of one of the syndicate\u2019s alleged drug lords.\nWhat emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly transnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the AFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often refer to as \u201cT1\u201d - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.\nThe syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and sophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin American cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies a bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a more diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels do, including Japan\u2019s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic Chinese gangs across Southeast Asia.\nThe crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled outbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police say. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked rivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a united pursuit of gargantuan profits.\n\u201cThe crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate with seamless efficiency,\u201d says one veteran Western anti-drugs official. \u201cThey function like a global corporation.\u201d\nLike most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed, the investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.\nIn addition to the contrasts between their drug operations, there\u2019s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop and Joaquin \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed Mexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine trafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their extravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has been revealed about Tse\u2019s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug lords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.\n\nA TRIP, A TRAP\nTse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern China, and grew up during China\u2019s Cultural Revolution. Amid the bloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group of imprisoned members of Mao\u2019s Red Guard in the southern city of Guangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big Circle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police, and like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong Kong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their criminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.\nIn the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong, Macau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based in Asia. He rose to become a\u00a0mid-ranking member of a smuggling ring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless opium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand, China and Laos meet.\nIn 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on drug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New York. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into America, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over his head.\nThrough a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged for leniency.\nHis ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His 12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed. If freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed \u201cgreat sorrow\u201d for his crime, court records show.\nThe entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to nine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional institution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.\nAfter he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to Canada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for the next four years. It\u2019s unclear when Tse returned to his old haunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife registered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company Ltd, in Hong Kong in 2011.\nPolice suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He \u201cpicked up where he left off,\u201d said the senior AFP investigator. Tse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and the Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved irresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his drug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no extra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.\nHis policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for business, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011, AFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and meth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather than arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under surveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely for more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug cell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They wanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.\nThe syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other drug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and selling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the syndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the Melbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police watched the Australian meet two men.\nOne of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted hair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese family man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance showed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal security. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators.\u00a0Up to eight worked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as part of his security protocol.\nTse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts and five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in private jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand for a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt, according to a member of the task force investigating the syndicate.\nTse was a frequent visitor to Asia\u2019s casinos and fond of betting on horses, especially on English races. \u201cWe believe he lost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the tables in Macau,\u201d said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.\nAs the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected that the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia with meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the Sam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say, when a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of white powder strapped to each of his thighs.\n\n\u2018ALADDIN\u2019S CAVE OF INTEL\u2019\nCai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the airport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It was the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous, picking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said a former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation. \u201cHis hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,\u201d the commander told Reuters. \u201cMethamphetamine is very toxic.\u201d\nCai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs was a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful tranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. \u201cWe were very fortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,\u201d the commander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been monitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police had no idea who he was.\nCai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a \u201cpesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,\u201d according to Myanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A friend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father. Cai\u2019s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for ketamine at the airport, the commander said.\nUnimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight. The next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport. One recognized him from surveillance work he\u2019d been conducting.\nStill, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they later found on one of his phones might have explained his silence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least three assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch and electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said one investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy saying \u201cLoyalty to the Heavens.\u201d The banner was a \u201ctriad-related sign,\u201d he added.\nThe tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed the video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat because he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a law enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of the victim\u2019s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad members were sending a message about the price of disloyalty, the officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.\nThe torture videos were just one of the items allegedly found in Cai\u2019s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was a diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate\u2019s activities, but sloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones, police say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media conversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.\nThey were \u201can Aladdin\u2019s Cave of intel,\u201d said one AFP commander based in North Asia.\nFor at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly traveled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for the syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the Drug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its investigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip from an international courier company recording the delivery of two consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf Chinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea packets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had been cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.\nTwo days after Cai\u2019s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon address, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That evening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon jetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so, Myanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but other than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate, including couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.\nThen came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery of photos and videos on Cai\u2019s phones,\u00a0an AFP investigator based in Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing he had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier. \u201cThis one stuck out because it was Canadian,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI said: \u2018Fuck, I know who you are!'\u201d\nIt was Tse Chi Lop.\nThe Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of intelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work on Cai\u2019s phones.\nAustralia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime gangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade, the AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and small, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent described the database, which includes a trove of names, chemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and surveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence on Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.\nThe AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai\u2019s phones with the database. They discovered photos related to three big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in China, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators and Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese anti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and addresses in Cai\u2019s phones to other meth busts in China.\nFor regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations upended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by different crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the work of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics agent said they believed Cai was \u201cone of the members of a mega-syndicate,\u201d which had been involved in multiple \u201cdrugs cases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.\u201d\nCai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still in jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking charges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to contact Cai\u2019s lawyer.\n\nMETH PARADISE\nDuring his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing the country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and obtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a bigger vessel in international waters, according to police and the Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures of the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where the meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.\nThe police reconstruction of Cai\u2019s dealings in Myanmar led to another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production had shifted from China\u2019s southern provinces to Shan State in Myanmar\u2019s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had provided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor ingredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were smuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the freedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.\nArmed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan State have long controlled large tracts of territory and used drug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the military. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar government with rebel groups over the years has brought relative calm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to flourish.\n\u201cProduction facilities can be hidden from law enforcement and other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,\u201d analyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the International Crisis Group. \u201cDrug production and profits are now so vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.\u201d\nThe Myanmar government and police did not respond to questions from Reuters.\nAlong the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there is evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts a deep ravine known as the \u201cValley of Death,\u201d where ethnic Kachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for decades with Myanmar\u2019s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past trucks carrying building materials and workers.\nThe Kaung Kha militia\u2019s immaculate and expansive new headquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green hills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers away, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved out of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned out vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba tablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine. When it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more than 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg of caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances used in drug production.\nThe Loikan facility was \u201cvery likely\u201d to have been the source of much of the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s meth, said the Yangon-based AFP officer.\n\u201cSome militia were involved in the lab,\u201d said Oi Khun, a communications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia, in an interview. He paused, then added: \u201cBut not with the knowledge of senior members\u201d of the militia.\nOne person in Loikan described how workers from the lab would come down from the hills. The men, like most of the villagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the locals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.\n\u201cI asked them once. \u2018Why don\u2019t you bathe?\u2019\u201d the person said. \u201cThey said they did, but there was nothing they could do about the smell.\u201d\nThe rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the skin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature stench might reveal their illicit activities. \u201cWe all knew,\u201d the person said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t talk about it. That just brings you danger.\u201d\nMeth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals, say Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network\u2019s couriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the Asia-Pacific.\nShan\u2019s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the world, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told Reuters. \u201cThey can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the ground and let it dry.\u201d\nThe UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth is worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business model for meth is \u201cvery different\u201d to heroin, said the UNODC\u2019s Douglas. \u201cInputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not needed, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore far, far higher.\u201d\nThe wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in northeastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a UNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control Commission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to the UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand, $298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the Japanese market, that\u2019s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.\nThe money the syndicate is making \u201cmeans that if they lose ten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,\u201d said the Chinese counter-narcotics official. \u201cThey can afford failure. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u2018MONEY, MONEY\u2019\nThe analysis of Cai\u2019s phones was continuing to provide leads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the pick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with Myanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at sea for weeks.\nOne of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the Shun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement document reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea when, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a marine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and paid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV Valkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s and hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea sickness tablets. According to local media, he didn\u2019t have a fishing license at the time.\nAfter buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on a course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in the Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the rendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western Australian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was seen \u201cunloading a lot of packages\u201d into a van, the commander said.\n\u201cWe knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of organized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and comes back with some gear on it, that it hasn\u2019t just dropped from the sky in the middle of the ocean.\u201d\nInvestigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car hire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug traffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say, that some of Smith\u2019s alleged co-conspirators were members of an ethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and Comanchero motorcycle gangs, known as \u201cbikies\u201d in Australia.\nAs they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of crystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor syndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy of an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians reconvened in Perth a month later.\nBikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and a self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had refined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star hotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police investigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants, said the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth. The restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that included caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.\nOn November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again, this time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the Andaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth from Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the Indian Ocean.\nThe Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.\nWhen the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in international waters off the West Australian coast on December 19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting \u201cmoney, money,\u201d according to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De Man\u2019s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith and his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved their identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by the crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.\nThe Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of Geraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The men unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of the AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault weapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty to importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of his alleged associates are still on trial.\nTaiwan\u2019s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it had \u201cworked together with our counterparts on the investigation\u201d of the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the \u201csubstantial seizure of illicit narcotics\u201d by the Australian authorities in December 2017. The bureau said it was \u201caware that Taiwanese syndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in (the) Asia-Pacific region,\u201d and was working \u201ccollaboratively and closely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and cross-border drug trafficking.\u201d\n\nNIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED\nAs the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police concluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone a kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the three biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the 1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The other two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse\u2019s original triad, and the Bamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator, the syndicate\u2019s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that it \u201cmust rival Apple\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cThe syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market to tap,\u201d said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior colonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade. \u201cThe power this network possesses is unimaginable.\u201d\nInvestigators have had wins. In February last year, police busted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough tea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66 was intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than one tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor lieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar. In December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected syndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.\nLocated near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed compound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used to experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a 100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to the back of the property.\nSue wasn\u2019t there, but property and money from 38 bank accounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized during the investigation. Sue is still at large.\nBut the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the wider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal meth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and Southeast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in most countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising seizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019, \u201csuggested the supply of the drug had expanded.\u201d\nIn the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive adversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug motherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product in shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth coming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the syndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This included deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each containing about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on narrow jungle paths.\nOver the years, police have had little success in taking down Asia\u2019s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders have been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to the AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics kingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than a short period was in the mid-1970s. That\u2019s when Ng Sik-ho, a wily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium and morphine, according to court records.\nSo far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho\u2019s fate. He is being tracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say counter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they believe he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.\n\n\n\n (Reporting by Tom Allard. Additional reporting by Reuters Staff. Editing by Peter Hirschberg.)",

        "text": "(For more Reuters Special Reports, click on)\nBy Tom Allard\nBANGKOK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - He is Asia\u2019s most-wanted man. He\nis protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private\njet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night\nat a Macau casino.\nTse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected\nof leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate\nformed out of an alliance of five of Asia\u2019s triad groups,\naccording to law enforcement officials. Its members call it\nsimply \u201cThe Company.\u201d Police, in a nod to one of Tse\u2019s\nnicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for \u201cBrother Number\nThree.\u201d\nThe syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of\nmethamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen\ncountries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South\nPacific. But meth \u2013 a highly addictive drug with devastating\nphysical and mental effects on long-term users \u2013 is its main\nbusiness, they say.\nIn what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations\nOffice on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s\nmeth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be\nas high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the\ncartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a\n40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has\nexpanded at least fourfold in the past five years.\nThis unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an\nunprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the\nprime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously\nunreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the\nAustralian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about\n20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far\nthe biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug\ntrafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in\nthe investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar,\nChina, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan,\nwhile not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the\ninvestigation.\nA document containing AFP profiles of the operation\u2019s top 19\nsyndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the\nleader of the syndicate. According to the document, the\norganization has \u201cbeen connected with or directly involved in at\nleast 13 cases\u201d of drug trafficking since January 2015. The\ndocument does not provide specific details of the cases.\nA Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the\n\u201cMultinational CEO\u201d of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement\nAdministration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional\ngovernment agencies says Tse is \u201cbelieved to be\u201d the leader of\nthe Sam Gor syndicate.\nPolice have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected\nboss of the trafficking group.\nSome investigators say that the scope of the syndicate\u2019s\noperation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin\nAmerica\u2019s most legendary narco-traffickers. \u201cTse Chi Lop is in\nthe league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,\u201d said Jeremy\nDouglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC.\n\u201cThe word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no\ndoubt it applies here.\u201d\nReuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to\nquestions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan\u2019s Ministry\nof Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on\ninvestigations.\nDuring the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific\nto uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This\nincluded interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement\nofficials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence\nreports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings\nand other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in\nMyanmar\u2019s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia\u2019s Golden\nTriangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing\ndrugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited\nthe Thai compound of one of the syndicate\u2019s alleged drug lords.\nWhat emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly\ntransnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the\nAFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often\nrefer to as \u201cT1\u201d - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong,\nMacau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.\nThe syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and\nsophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin\nAmerican cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies\na bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a\nmore diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels\ndo, including Japan\u2019s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic\nChinese gangs across Southeast Asia.\nThe crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled\noutbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police\nsay. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked\nrivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a\nunited pursuit of gargantuan profits.\n\u201cThe crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate\nwith seamless efficiency,\u201d says one veteran Western anti-drugs\nofficial. \u201cThey function like a global corporation.\u201d\nLike most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed,\nthe investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.\nIn addition to the contrasts between their drug operations,\nthere\u2019s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop\nand Joaquin \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed\nMexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine\ntrafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their\nextravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has\nbeen revealed about Tse\u2019s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug\nlords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.\n\nA TRIP, A TRAP\nTse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern\nChina, and grew up during China\u2019s Cultural Revolution. Amid the\nbloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group\nof imprisoned members of Mao\u2019s Red Guard in the southern city of\nGuangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big\nCircle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police,\nand like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong\nKong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their\ncriminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.\nIn the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong,\nMacau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based\nin Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling\nring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless\nopium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand,\nChina and Laos meet.\nIn 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on\ndrug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New\nYork. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into\nAmerica, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over\nhis head.\nThrough a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged\nfor leniency.\nHis ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His\n12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed.\nIf freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed\n\u201cgreat sorrow\u201d for his crime, court records show.\nThe entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to\nnine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional\ninstitution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.\nAfter he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to\nCanada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for\nthe next four years. It\u2019s unclear when Tse returned to his old\nhaunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife\nregistered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company\nLtd, in Hong Kong in 2011.\nPolice suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He\n\u201cpicked up where he left off,\u201d said the senior AFP investigator.\nTse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and\nthe Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved\nirresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his\ndrug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no\nextra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.\nHis policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for\nbusiness, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011,\nAFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and\nmeth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather\nthan arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under\nsurveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely\nfor more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug\ncell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They\nwanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.\nThe syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other\ndrug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and\nselling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the\nsyndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the\nMelbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police\nwatched the Australian meet two men.\nOne of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted\nhair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese\nfamily man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance\nshowed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal\nsecurity. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of\nThai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eight\nworked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as\npart of his security protocol.\nTse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts\nand five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in\nprivate jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand\nfor a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt,\naccording to a member of the task force investigating the\nsyndicate.\nTse was a frequent visitor to Asia\u2019s casinos and fond of\nbetting on horses, especially on English races. \u201cWe believe he\nlost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the\ntables in Macau,\u201d said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.\nAs the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected\nthat the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia\nwith meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA,\ncommonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the\nSam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say,\nwhen a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of\nwhite powder strapped to each of his thighs.\n\n\u2018ALADDIN\u2019S CAVE OF INTEL\u2019\nCai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the\nairport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It\nwas the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous,\npicking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said\na former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation.\n\u201cHis hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,\u201d the\ncommander told Reuters. \u201cMethamphetamine is very toxic.\u201d\nCai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs\nwas a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful\ntranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. \u201cWe were very\nfortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,\u201d the\ncommander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been\nmonitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police\nhad no idea who he was.\nCai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a\n\u201cpesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,\u201d according to\nMyanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A\nfriend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father.\nCai\u2019s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for\nketamine at the airport, the commander said.\nUnimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight.\nThe next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport.\nOne recognized him from surveillance work he\u2019d been conducting.\nStill, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they\nlater found on one of his phones might have explained his\nsilence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least\nthree assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch\nand electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said\none investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy\nsaying \u201cLoyalty to the Heavens.\u201d The banner was a \u201ctriad-related\nsign,\u201d he added.\nThe tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed\nthe video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat\nbecause he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a\nlaw enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of\nthe victim\u2019s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad\nmembers were sending a message about the price of disloyalty,\nthe officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.\nThe torture videos were just one of the items allegedly\nfound in Cai\u2019s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was\na diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate\u2019s activities, but\nsloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones,\npolice say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media\nconversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.\nThey were \u201can Aladdin\u2019s Cave of intel,\u201d said one AFP\ncommander based in North Asia.\nFor at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly\ntravelled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for\nthe syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the\nDrug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its\ninvestigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip\nfrom an international courier company recording the delivery of\ntwo consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf\nChinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea\npackets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had\nbeen cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.\nTwo days after Cai\u2019s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon\naddress, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That\nevening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon\njetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so,\nMyanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but\nother than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate,\nincluding couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.\nThen came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery\nof photos and videos on Cai\u2019s phones, an AFP investigator based\nin Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing\nhe had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier.\n\u201cThis one stuck out because it was Canadian,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI\nsaid: \u2018Fuck, I know who you are!'\u201d\nIt was Tse Chi Lop.\nThe Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of\nintelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work\non Cai\u2019s phones.\nAustralia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime\ngangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade,\nthe AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and\nsmall, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent\ndescribed the database, which includes a trove of names,\nchemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and\nsurveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence\non Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.\nThe AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai\u2019s\nphones with the database. They discovered photos related to\nthree big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in\nChina, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators\nand Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese\nanti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and\naddresses in Cai\u2019s phones to other meth busts in China.\nFor regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations\nupended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by\ndifferent crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the\nwork of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics\nagent said they believed Cai was \u201cone of the members of a\nmega-syndicate,\u201d which had been involved in multiple \u201cdrugs\ncases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.\u201d\nCai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still\nin jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking\ncharges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to\ncontact Cai\u2019s lawyer.\n\nMETH PARADISE\nDuring his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing\nthe country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and\nobtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a\nbigger vessel in international waters, according to police and\nthe Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures\nof the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where\nthe meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.\nThe police reconstruction of Cai\u2019s dealings in Myanmar led\nto another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production\nhad shifted from China\u2019s southern provinces to Shan State in\nMyanmar\u2019s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had\nprovided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor\ningredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were\nsmuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in\nthe Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the\nfreedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.\nArmed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan\nState have long controlled large tracts of territory and used\ndrug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the\nmilitary. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar\ngovernment with rebel groups over the years has brought relative\ncalm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to\nflourish.\n\u201cProduction facilities can be hidden from law enforcement\nand other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,\u201d\nanalyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the\nInternational Crisis Group. \u201cDrug production and profits are now\nso vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.\u201d\nThe Myanmar government and police did not respond to\nquestions from Reuters.\nAlong the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there\nis evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts\na deep ravine known as the \u201cValley of Death,\u201d where ethnic\nKachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for\ndecades with Myanmar\u2019s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past\ntrucks carrying building materials and workers.\nThe Kaung Kha militia\u2019s immaculate and expansive new\nheadquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green\nhills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers\naway, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved\nout of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned\nout vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba\ntablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine.\nWhen it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more\nthan 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg\nof caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances\nused in drug production.\nThe Loikan facility was \u201cvery likely\u201d to have been the\nsource of much of the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s meth, said the\nYangon-based AFP officer.\n\u201cSome militia were involved in the lab,\u201d said Oi Khun, a\ncommunications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia,\nin an interview. He paused, then added: \u201cBut not with the\nknowledge of senior members\u201d of the militia.\nOne person in Loikan described how workers from the lab\nwould come down from the hills. The men, like most of the\nvillagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the\nlocals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.\n\u201cI asked them once. \u2018Why don\u2019t you bathe?\u2019\u201d the person said.\n\u201cThey said they did, but there was nothing they could do about\nthe smell.\u201d\nThe rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the\nskin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature\nstench might reveal their illicit activities. \u201cWe all knew,\u201d the\nperson said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t talk about it. That just brings you\ndanger.\u201d\nMeth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals,\nsay Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network\u2019s\ncouriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the\nAsia-Pacific.\nShan\u2019s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the\nworld, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told\nReuters. \u201cThey can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the\nground and let it dry.\u201d\nThe UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth\nis worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business\nmodel for meth is \u201cvery different\u201d to heroin, said the UNODC\u2019s\nDouglas. \u201cInputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not\nneeded, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore\nfar, far higher.\u201d\nThe wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in\nnortheastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a\nUNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control\nCommission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to\nthe UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand,\n$298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the\nJapanese market, that\u2019s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.\nThe money the syndicate is making \u201cmeans that if they lose\nten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,\u201d\nsaid the Chinese counter-narcotics official. \u201cThey can afford\nfailure. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u2018MONEY, MONEY\u2019\nThe analysis of Cai\u2019s phones was continuing to provide\nleads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the\npick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with\nMyanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at\nsea for weeks.\nOne of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the\nShun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement\ndocument reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea\nwhen, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a\nmarine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and\npaid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV\nValkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s\nand hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea\nsickness tablets. According to local media, he didn\u2019t have a\nfishing license at the time.\nAfter buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on\na course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in\nthe Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the\nrendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western\nAustralian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was\nseen \u201cunloading a lot of packages\u201d into a van, the commander\nsaid.\n\u201cWe knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of\norganized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and\ncomes back with some gear on it, that it hasn\u2019t just dropped\nfrom the sky in the middle of the ocean.\u201d\nInvestigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car\nhire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug\ntraffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say,\nthat some of Smith\u2019s alleged co-conspirators were members of an\nethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and\nComanchero motorcycle gangs, known as \u201cbikies\u201d in Australia.\nAs they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of\ncrystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor\nsyndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy\nof an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians\nreconvened in Perth a month later.\nBikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and\na self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had\nrefined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star\nhotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police\ninvestigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants,\nsaid the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth.\nThe restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that\nincluded caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.\nOn November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again,\nthis time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the\nAndaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth\nfrom Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast\nof the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the\nIndian Ocean.\nThe Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.\nWhen the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in\ninternational waters off the West Australian coast on December\n19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting \u201cmoney, money,\u201d\naccording to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De\nMan\u2019s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith\nand his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved\ntheir identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by\nthe crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.\nThe Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of\nGeraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The\nmen unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of\nthe AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault\nweapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty\nto importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of\nhis alleged associates are still on trial.\nTaiwan\u2019s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it\nhad \u201cworked together with our counterparts on the investigation\u201d\nof the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the \u201csubstantial\nseizure of illicit narcotics\u201d by the Australian authorities in\nDecember 2017. The bureau said it was \u201caware that Taiwanese\nsyndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in\n(the) Asia-Pacific region,\u201d and was working \u201ccollaboratively and\nclosely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and\ncross-border drug trafficking.\u201d\n\nNIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED\nAs the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police\nconcluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone\na kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the\nthree biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the\n1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The\nother two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse\u2019s original triad, and the\nBamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator,\nthe syndicate\u2019s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that\nit \u201cmust rival Apple\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cThe syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market\nto tap,\u201d said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior\ncolonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade.\n\u201cThe power this network possesses is unimaginable.\u201d\nInvestigators have had wins. In February last year, police\nbusted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough\ntea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66\nwas intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than\none tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor\nlieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar.\nIn December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected\nsyndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.\nLocated near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed\ncompound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used\nto experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a\n100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to\nthe back of the property.\nSue wasn\u2019t there, but property and money from 38 bank\naccounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized\nduring the investigation. Sue is still at large.\nBut the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the\nwider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal\nmeth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and\nSoutheast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in\nmost countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising\nseizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019,\n\u201csuggested the supply of the drug had expanded.\u201d\nIn the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive\nadversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug\nmotherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product\nin shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth\ncoming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the\nsyndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This\nincluded deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each\ncontaining about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on\nnarrow jungle paths.\nOver the years, police have had little success in taking\ndown Asia\u2019s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders\nhave been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to\nthe AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics\nkingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than\na short period was in the mid-1970s. That\u2019s when Ng Sik-ho, a\nwily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced\nto 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium\nand morphine, according to court records.\nSo far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho\u2019s fate. He is being\ntracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say\ncounter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they\nbelieve he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.\n(Reporting by Tom Allard. Additional reporting by Reuters\nStaff. Editing by Peter Hirschberg.)",

        "text": "By Nellie Peyton\nNEW YORK, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda on\nThursday announced plans for a bill that would impose the death\npenalty on homosexuals, following plans announced by Brunei\nearlier this year to do the same.\nSame-sex relations are illegal in at least 68 countries\naround the world, according to the International Lesbian, Gay,\nBisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA).\nIn addition to Uganda and Brunei, here are eight countries\nthat have recently moved to roll back LGBT+ rights.\n\n1. United States\nThe United States began implementing a ban on transgender\npeople serving in the military this year, after President Donald\nTrump announced the change in 2017.\nTrump cited medical costs as one reason for rolling back a\n2016 policy of his predecessor Barack Obama, which had allowed\ntransgender people to serve openly for the first time and also\nreceive medical care to transition genders.\n\n2. Russia\nRussia fined its first minor last year under a so-called\n\"gay propaganda\" law that has been increasingly used to repress\nthe LGBT+ community.\nThe 2013 law makes illegal any event or act regarded by the\nauthorities as an attempt to promote homosexuality to minors. It\nhas been used to stop gay pride marches and detain gay rights\nactivists.\n\n3. Poland\nPoland's ruling party leader condemned gay pride marches\nthis year and said the rule of law should be used to regulate\nwhat he called a \"travelling theatre\".\nAhead of elections later this month, the conservative Law\nand Justice (PiS) party has used its anti-LGBT+ stance as a key\ncampaign issue, which critics say has fomented violence toward\nthe gay community.\n\n4. Indonesia\nIndonesia has drafted a law that would ban gay sex, which\nparliament delayed voting on last month amid protests.\nThe proposed revisions to the criminal code also include a\nban on sex outside of marriage, a four-year jail term for\nabortions in the absence of a medical emergency or rape and a\nprison term for black magic.\n\n5. Nigeria\nNigeria passed a bill in 2014 that criminalized same-sex\nrelationships with penalties of up to 14 years in prison.\nAuthorities charged 43 people with homosexual acts in one\ncase in 2017, ordering most to undergo monitoring and \"sexual\nrehabilitation.\"\n\n6. Malaysia\nMalaysia's LGBT+ community has faced growing persecution,\nwith two women caned in public for \"attempting lesbian sex\" in\nthe state of Terengganu last year.\nPrime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the leader of a new\ngovernment elected last year, has said the country cannot accept\nsame-sex marriage or LGBT+ rights.\n\n7. Chad\nChad introduced a new penal code in 2017 with light prison\nsentences and fines for same-sex relations which had not been\nexplicitly criminalized before, although there was a law\ncondemning \"acts against nature\", according to the ILGA.\nAn earlier draft of the legislation from 2014 would have\ncriminalized gay sex with up to 20 years in prison.\n\n8. Slovakia\nSlovakia inserted a definition of traditional marriage in\nits constitution in 2014.\nIn 2015 the country held a referendum which would have\nstrengthened its ban on marriage and child adoption by same-sex\ncouples, but it failed to pass on low voter turnout.\n(Writing by Nellie Peyton; Editing by Chris Michaud.

        "text": "By Beh Lih Yi\nKUALA LUMPUR, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A\nMalaysian recruitment agency set to launch a pioneering\n\"ethical\" hiring model has called for an industry overhaul to\ntackle debt bondage among migrant workers and end modern slavery\nin the Southeast Asian nation.\nLed by a team of three women, Kuala Lumpur-based Pinkcollar\nhas billed itself as the first ethical recruitment agency in\nMalaysia, which relies heavily on foreign labourers to fill jobs\nin construction, factories or domestic care.\nThe company will drop the hefty fees usually imposed by\nrecruitment firms on workers for helping them find jobs, an\nindustry-wide policy that has pushed thousands of people into\ncrippling debt they are rarely able to escape.\n\"We are trying to disrupt it (the industry) really,\" founder\nZenna Law told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at Pinkcollar's\noffice ahead of the \"ethical\" scheme's launch on Wednesday.\n\"We are hoping that ... we can elevate the standard of the\nentire industry,\" said Law, who along with her partners is in\nher 20s and was raised with the help of migrant domestic workers\nas a child.\nMalaysia is home to millions of foreign labourers and one of\nthe top destinations in Asia for impoverished women from\ncountries such as Indonesia and the Philippines who take up jobs\nas domestic workers.\nCases of abuse have been widely reported, but migrant rights\ngroups say workers often cannot escape as they have to work to\nrepay the recruiters that found them work and make deductions\nfrom their monthly wages.\nThe Malaysian government said last year it was looking into\nways to cut middlemen and end debt bondage, a form of modern-day\nslavery.\nAlthough it is a first for Malaysia, ethical recruiters have\nsprung up in the Philippines and Hong Kong in recent years as\nbusinesses and private households come under pressure to end\nslavery.\nPinkcollar will focus on domestic workers from the\nPhilippines in its first phase, recruiting through social media\nbefore matching them with employers through interviews that give\nboth parties a say in the hiring process and terms.\nThe hiring fees, which typically range from 12,000 to 18,000\nMalaysian ringgit ($2,900-$4,300), will be payable by the\nemployer, said Pinkcollar's Law.\nThe firm's name is derived from the term given to jobs\nusually held by women - such as nannies and helpers.\n\"When workers owe agencies, not only they have less freedom\nto switch jobs but also to leave bad and unsafe work place. Debt\nbondage is what we are trying to tackle,\" Law said.\nMigrant rights groups welcomed the initiative but warned its\nimplementation could be problematic as countries such as\nIndonesia would only allow workers to go abroad through its\nlocally-approved agencies.\n\"It could be quite chaotic for the sending country because\nthey want to monitor the whereabouts of the workers,\" said Alex\nOng from advocacy group Migrant Care, which campaigns for\nmigrant workers in Malaysia.\nRecruitment agencies are not allowed to charge workers in\nthe formal sectors - such as manufacturing and plantation - fees\nthat are higher one month's salary, under current guidelines set\nby the employers' group, the Malaysian Employers' Federation.\nBut domestic workers are excluded from the clause, and\ntypically have to spend six months with almost all their wages\ndeducted to cover the costs they owe the recruiters for local\ntravel or medical tests, said Ong.\n\"The question is why this protection is not applicable for\ndomestic workers too,\" asked Ong, calling for a legal reform.\nMalaysia is home to an estimated 212,000 of about 40 million\npeople trapped in modern slavery worldwide, according to the\nGlobal Slavery Index by human rights group Walk Free Foundation.\n($1 = 4.1910 ringgit)\n(Reporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi; Editing by Michael Taylor.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

The police also\nfroze 42 bank accounts it says were used by the group to finance\ntheir activities.\nAl-Mamun entered Brazil six years ago as a refugee, and was\nliving in Bras, a diverse neighborhood in Sao Paulo that is home\nto immigrants from around the world.\nHe has been indicted on U.S. charges. According to the\nUnited States Department of Justice, Al-Mamun is alleged to have\nhoused people coming from Southeast Asia in S\u00e3o Paulo and\narranged for their travel through a network of smugglers\noperating in Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica,\nNicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico.\nAccording to Brazilian police, he and his group were\nsmuggling into Brazil, and then to the United States, people\nfrom Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan.\nThey were sent to Brazil's northern Acre state to start a\nlong and dangerous trip through Central America all the way to\nthe Mexican border, to cross into the United States.\nReuters was not able to confirm whether Al-Mamun had a\nlawyer in Sao Paulo who could be contacted for comment.\nBrazilian police said the group charged people coming from\nAsia around 50,000 reais ($12,524) for the attempt to reach the\nUnited States. Some would also stay illegally in Brazil, where\nthey were given fraudulent documentation.\nPolice said people suffered violence while waiting in Sao\nPaulo to start the trip north.

        "text": "By Oscar Lopez\nMEXICO CITY, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When\nMexican entrepreneur Alvaro Velasco came up with the idea of a\ndigital app that provided earthquake warnings he was convinced\nhe had the ideal business that could be a commercial success\nwhile helping society.\nBut door after door slammed as he tried to get money and\nlegal assistance from both the government and the private sector\nto set up his social enterprise, SkyAlert - and he was not alone\nin this challenge.\nMexico was listed on Tuesday as the worst country for social\nentrepreneurs out of the world's 45 biggest economies in the\nsecond global poll of experts by the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nIt fell 15 places from the inaugural survey three years ago.\nArgentina, Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela were the other\nLatin American countries in the poll, coming 26th, 38th, 39th\nand 40th respectively in the ranking of 43 nations. Iran and\nSaudi Arabia were dropped due to difficulties polling there.\n\"In Mexico City, there's been a brutal slowdown in the\natmosphere for entrepreneurship,\" said Velasco.\n\"With few resources, with zero possibility of accessing\npublic funds ... and always fighting local and federal\ngovernments that don't want you to operate, it becomes mission\nimpossible, and that's what we have to fight against in Mexico.\"\nThe poll of about 900 social enterprise experts, conducted\nwith Deutsche Bank, found Mexico saw the biggest slump of any\ncountry when respondents were asked if social entrepreneurship\nwas gaining momentum there. It dropped 32 places to number 40.\nMexico was one of the worst two countries when it came to\npublic understanding the work of social entrepreneurs, leaving\nthem struggling to sell to the public, and also in the bottom\ntwo countries when it came to support from government policy.\nThe findings echoed a 2017 study from the Failure Institute,\na nonprofit organization that investigates why various\nendeavours fail, that found more than 80% of Mexican social\nenterprises had a life expectancy of less than three years.\nThe biggest causes of failure, the study found, were a lack\nof resources and infrastructure and public and private\nresistance to investing in social enterprises.\n\nLACK OF UNDERSTANDING\n\"There's only a small minority of people who see social\nentrepreneurship as a significant or important value\nproposition,\" said Alejandro Morales Garcia, from the Eugenio\nGarza Laguera Entrepreneurship Institute at Mexico's Tecnologico\nde Monterrey university.\n\"It's difficult for projects to flourish or be born or to\ncontinue to develop if we keep thinking in this same way.\"\nThe country of about 130 million people fared badly in most\nof 12 indicators used to measure political economic, regulatory\nand cultural factors impacting social entrepreneurs. Topping the\npoll were Canada, Australia and France.\nMexico also came third last when looking at where women were\nplaying a leading role as social entrepreneurs, rating just\nabove Brazil and the United States.\nMarcela Torres, founder of startup Hola Code, said Mexican\nmachismo was a constant battle for women in social enterprise.\nWhen she was first launching her company, which teaches\nyoung deportees in Mexico how to code, she said investors would\noften only address her male co-founder.\n\"There's an expectation in Mexico that a woman should behave\na certain way or talk a certain way,\" Torres told the Thomson\nReuters Foundation.\n\"I know a lot of women who develop strategies to seem more\nlikeable, so that they're not perceived as hard.\"\nTorres said she also had to struggle with a legal system\nthat offered no real incentives for startups, and a government\nthat offered little support for social entrepreneurs.\n\"(Social enterprise) doesn't even enter the radar of the\nMexican government,\" she said.\nIn June, the administration of leftist President Andres\nManuel Lopez Obrador, who took office in December, scrapped the\nNational Institute for Entrepreneurs (Inadem), a government\nagency which supported small businesses.\nLeaders of his Morena party said dissolving the Inadem would\ncut out the middleman and root out corruption with support going\ndirectly to beneficiaries.\nBut Torres and other business leaders were concerned the\ngovernment hasn't done enough to ensure they get this support.\n\"The Inadem was a fairly corrupt institution, and I don't\nthink it was a bad decision to dissolve it but the problem is\nthat it's left a gap,\" she said.\nA representative from Mexico's economy ministry did not\nrespond to a Thomson Reuters Foundation request for comment on\nthe poll.\nMexico also ranked among the lowest for access to investment\nand the ability to sell to businesses, which entrepreneurs said\nmade long-term survival all but impossible.\n\"It's very difficult to become self-sustainable in Mexico,\"\nsaid Velasco. \"It's hard for investors to notice you because\nthey only look at the return on investment, more than leaving a\nmark on society.\"\n(Reporting by Oscar Lopez.

Dozens of U.S. border agents stood behind a gate topped with razor wire, which blocked the path into the United States.\nSome migrants said they were trying to cross as a group into the United States, and were frustrated that court dates kept being pushed backwards, leaving them uncertain of how long they would be stuck in Mexico.\n\"We want to argue to cross over - we didn't ask to be in Mexico, they sent us here unjustly,\" said a man who declined to give his name. He said he had a court date in the United States.\nMatamoros mayor Mario Lopez and a Mexican migration official pleaded with asylum-seekers to clear the blockage. \nA Honduran man responded by indicating the lumps and rash on the throat of his young daughter, which he attributed to unhygienic conditions in the camp.\nHe said Mexican officials encouraged those in the camp to take a government paid-for bus back to the border with Guatemala, instead of pursuing their U.S. asylum claims. He said this was not a safe option for his family.\n\"I'd have to go back to Honduras. And you know the news there. If we go back to Honduras, in one day, in 24 hours, we're dead.\"\nTens of thousands of Hondurans have fled gang violence and criminality in the country, whose murder rate ranks among the world\u2019s highest.\nElias Rodriguez, public affairs liaison for U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Brownsville, wrote in a statement that traffic on the Gateway bridge between the two cities remained closed in both directions and that Thursday's MPP immigration court hearings were being rescheduled.\nRodriguez separately told Reuters there had been no violence.\nMore than 51,000 migrants, mostly asylum seekers, have been returned to Mexico under MPP. At least 8,000 have been sent to Matamoros, a border city in crime-wracked Taumaulipas state, since the policy was expanded in July from other parts of the U.S.-Mexico border.\nTheir sense of uncertainty comes amid news of shifting U.S. policies. The U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision last month that would allow the U.S. government to deny asylum to people who have passed through a third country, such as Mexico, and not requested refuge there first.\n\n (Additional reporting by Delphine Schrank in Mexico City, Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Paul Simao and David Gregorio)",

He said he had a court date in the United States.\nMatamoros mayor Mario Lopez and a Mexican migration official\npleaded with asylum-seekers to clear the blockage.\nA Honduran man responded by indicating the lumps and rash on\nthe throat of his young daughter, which he attributed to\nunhygienic conditions in the camp.\nHe said Mexican officials encouraged those in the camp to\ntake a government paid-for bus back to the border with\nGuatemala, instead of pursuing their U.S. asylum claims. He said\nthis was not a safe option for his family.\n\"I'd have to go back to Honduras. And you know the news\nthere. If we go back to Honduras, in one day, in 24 hours, we're\ndead.\"\nTens of thousands of Hondurans have fled gang violence and\ncriminality in the country, whose murder rate ranks among the\nworld\u2019s highest.\nElias Rodriguez, public affairs liaison for U.S. Customs and\nBorder Protection in Brownsville, wrote in a statement that\ntraffic on the Gateway bridge between the two cities remained\nclosed in both directions and that Thursday's MPP immigration\ncourt hearings were being rescheduled.\nRodriguez separately told Reuters there had been no\nviolence.\nMore than 51,000 migrants, mostly asylum seekers, have been\nreturned to Mexico under MPP. At least 8,000 have been sent to\nMatamoros, a border city in crime-wracked Taumaulipas state,\nsince the policy was expanded in July from other parts of the\nU.S.-Mexico border.\nTheir sense of uncertainty comes amid news of shifting U.S.\npolicies. The U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision last month\nthat would allow the U.S. government to deny asylum to people\nwho have passed through a third country, such as Mexico, and not\nrequested refuge there first.\n(Additional reporting by Delphine Schrank in Mexico City,\nEditing by Frank Jack Daniel and Paul Simao and David Gregorio)",

        "text": "By Megan Rowling\nBARCELONA, Oct 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The Green\nClimate Fund, one of the main sources of finance for developing\nnations to tackle climate change, is hoping wealthy countries\nwill pledge between $9 billion and $10 billion to refill its\ncoffers at a conference in Paris on Friday.\nClimate finance analysts said the outcome would be key to\nbuilding trust with poorer states preparing more ambitious\nclimate action plans which are due to be submitted to the United\nNations by the end of 2020.\nEnvironment and development groups are calling for at least\n$15 billion in new commitments for the Green Climate Fund (GCF),\nsaying projects that may use up close to that amount are already\nin the pipeline, with needs only increasing as the planet warms.\nLucile Dufour, international policy advisor with Climate\nAction Network France, said the GCF replenishment was happening\n\"at a crucial point in the fight against climate change\", and\ncalled on donors to double their contributions at a minimum.\n\"This is a matter of justice and survival for developing\ncountries and the most vulnerable communities,\" she told\njournalists, noting the devastation from increasingly wild\nweather around the world.\nThe fund's executive director, Yannick Glemarec, told the\nThomson Reuters Foundation this week's meeting would be a\n\"success\" if pledges exceeded the $9.3 billion garnered at its\nfirst conference in 2014.\nSince late last year the fund has secured pledges of about\n$7.4 billion from 16 countries for 2020-2023, with large donors\nlike Germany, France and Britain doubling 2014 contributions.\nNew announcements from some other potentially large donors\nare expected to raise that figure on Friday, including Japan,\nItaly, Switzerland, Finland and Belgium.\n\"It is not easy right now for any kind of financial\ncontributors to dramatically increase their contribution because\nmost of them are facing real budgetary constraints,\" Glemarec\nsaid, noting some \"exceptional efforts\" to double donations.\nDespite total promises of just over $10 billion for the\nfund's first five years, U.S. President Donald Trump, a\nclimate-change sceptic, refused to deliver two-thirds of his\ncountry's  $3 billion pledge.\nCurrency fluctuations meanwhile further cut the actual total\navailable to the fund, to about $7.2 billion.\nGlemarec and others expressed hope the United States could\n\"re-engage\" with the fund in coming years.\nJoe Thwaites, a climate finance researcher with\nWashington-based World Resources Institute, said domestic\npolitics meant it was \"disappointing but not surprising\" that\nthe United States and Australia had indicated they would not\ncontribute now.\nHe also urged some countries whose new pledges were flat or\nup slightly, like Canada and the Netherlands, to give more.\nA report from the U.N. climate science panel showed last\nyear that climate action financing, both from governments and\nbusiness, had so far been inadequate, Thwaites said.\n\"There is a very clear sense that we need to see major\nincreases and particularly for adaptation, where the needs are\nonly going to rise.\"\n\nMORE FOR THE POOREST?\nThe GCF has allocated some $5.2 billion to 111 projects in\n99 countries ranging from green, low-cost housing in Mongolia's\npolluted capital and a rapid-transit bus system in Karachi using\nmethane to restoring climate-threatened ecosystems in Namibia.\nIt expects to have parcelled out the rest of its initial pot\nby the end of 2019, Glemarec said, adding he hoped it would be\nable to grow its project pipeline in future.\nAid agencies praise the fund's push to divide its money\nbetween projects to reduce planet-warming emissions and efforts\nto adapt to climate shifts and rising seas, as adaptation has\nreceived only about a fifth of global climate finance until now.\nGlemarec said that since 2015 nearly 70% of the $1.9 billion\nthe fund had allocated for adaptation was for projects in the\nmost vulnerable poor countries, African nations and small island\nstates, stressing the aim was to maintain or raise that share.\nLiane Schalatek, associate director at the Heinrich B\u00f6ll\nFoundation North America and civil society observer at the GCF,\nsaid it should increasingly work with approved ministries and\nagencies in developing states to reach local communities.\n\"There needs to be a focus on the poorest and most\ndisenfranchised people who are usually not given voice and much\nopportunity to participate in or benefit from decision-making on\nclimate change,\" she said.\n(Reporting by Megan Rowling @meganrowling; editing by Chris\nMichaud.

        "text": "By Maina Waruru\nNAIROBI, Kenya, Oct 8 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -\nH appiness Kapota will remember forever the day when her children\nlined up in Nairobi to receive their birth certificates.\nJoyce, Caleb and Sidet Moyo were among the first children\nfrom Kenya's stateless Shona group to receive the\ngovernment-issued certificates, which will give them\nopportunities and rights long denied to the Shona.\nThe day was particularly poignant for Kapota, 25, because\nshe was barred from sitting a key school exam for lack of\ndocuments, forcing her to drop out at 15.\n\"My teachers tried to help but there's nothing they could\ndo, so I dropped out and became a housemaid since we were very\npoor,\" Kapota told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding she\nhoped to return to school one day.\nKenya's move to end the plight of the Shona comes amid a\nglobal campaign to eradicate statelessness thought to affect an\nestimated 10 million people worldwide who are not recognised as\nnationals by any country.\nKenya sent a high-level delegation to a major\nintergovernmental meeting in Geneva on Monday to discuss\nprogress at the midpoint of the #Ibelong campaign, ahead of a\n2024 deadline.\nA person may be stateless as a result of discrimination\nbased on ethnicity, religion or gender, the transfer of\nterritory between states, or conflicting nationality laws.\nStateless people often lack documentation necessary to\nattend school, open a bank account, get a job, passport or\nmobile phone, or enter government buildings, according to the\nU.N. refugee agency (UNHCR).\nThe 3,500-strong stateless Shona community has been in Kenya\nfor more than 50 years, many of them born and raised there, but\nthey are not recognised as Kenyan nationals and have no official\nstatus in Zimbabwe from where they arrived in the 1960s.\nKapota's children were among 600 young Shona who received\ntheir birth certificates at a ceremony in August, said Wanja\nMunaita, Kenya's UNHCR officer on statelessness.\nAbout 2,000 adults have also applied and are waiting for\ntheir documents to be processed, she added.\nKenya set a precedent two years ago when it awarded\ncitizenship to another stateless group, the Makonde, originally\nfrom Mozambique, ending 80 years of statelessness for its 8,000\npeople.\n\nDISCRIMINATION\nOliver Muregerera, a community leader from the Shona's\nGospel of God Church, said his people have faced widespread\ndiscrimination.\n\"We have a lived a life of poverty and squalor since without\ndocuments (we) cannot secure a good job, own property or access\ncritical government services,\" said Muregerera.\nShumarry Maleon, a government assistant director of\nregistration, said all Shona would be issued with birth\ncertificates.\nBut while this is an important step it does not guarantee\nthe Shona citizenship, a recognition President Uhuru Kenyatta\npromised in 2017.\nKenya has an estimated 18,500 stateless people.\nGeorge Kegoro of the Kenyan Human Rights Commission said the\ncountry could not say it was on course to meet social goals such\nas improved access to education and health while failing to\nrecognise part of its population as citizens.\nKegoro, the charity's executive director, said birth\ncertificates were not enough and it was crucial to keep up\npressure until the community received formal recognition.\n\nBETTER DATA\nKenya hopes to get a clearer picture of its stateless\npopulation when the results of a national census conducted in\nAugust are made public next year.\n\"We have been told that the national census has a provision\nto capture data on stateless people which is important, and\nUNHCR is appealing to all stateless people in Kenya to come out\nand identify themselves during the exercise,\" said the UNHCR's\nMunaita.\nAfrican states have increasingly become aware that\nstatelessness is a major problem.\nA 2017 declaration by the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS), a grouping of 15 countries, highlighted the\npolitical will of its member states to tackle the issue.\nThe African Court on Human and People's Rights ruled in 2018\nthat Tanzania arbitrarily deprived a man of Tanzanian\ncitizenship and ordered the government to update its\nlegislation, potentially paving the way for other countries to\nfollow suit.\n(Reporting by Maina Waruru, editing by Astrid Zweynert, Zoe\nTabary and Emma Batha.

But food is not\nbeing produced where it is most needed. Countries are failing to\nprovide incentives to farmers to produce more nutritious food.\n\"Countries keep subsidising products with low nutritional\nvalue, favouring staple foods \u2014 wheat, rice, maize \u2014 over\nfruits and vegetables. This has a negative effect on nutrition\nand dietary diversity.\n\"If we want to envision a world free of hunger and\nmalnutrition, production incentives have to change.\n\"We need better incentives for the world's agricultural\nproducers. Better information to prod consumers into choosing\nhealthier diets. Sustainable trade with clear rules. And a big\npush to think of nutrition as part of food safety.\"\nJESSICA FANZO, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, JOHN HOPKINS UNIVERSITY\nAND CO-CHAIR, GLOBAL NUTRITION REPORT\n\"One thing that would be a game-changer for food systems is\nfor countries to develop holistic food system policies with\nclear, near and long-term, time-bound actions and goals to be\nachieved for human and planetary health.\n\"There are agriculture, climate change and nutrition\nnational policies, but very few that bring it all together.\"\nBABA DIOUM, JOINT WINNER OF 2019 AFRICA FOOD PRIZE AND\nAGRICULTURAL ENTREPRENEUR, SENEGAL\n\"To respond to such concerns, it is imperative to move\ntowards a new agricultural policy capable of preserving the\nproductive bases of soil, water and biodiversity in order to\nestablish durability.\n\"Such a policy, through innovative technologies and\nincentives, enables farmers to produce and market enough\nagri-food products with high nutritional value that meet\nsanitary and phytosanitary standards for the protection of\nconsumers.\"\nMAHESH BADAL, LIVELIHOOD AND NATURAL RESOURCE COORDINATOR,\nACTIONAID NEPAL\n\"There can be no end to rising world hunger without\nempowering women farmers and restoring the rights of rural\ncommunities.\n\"Women make up at least half of the smallholders, marginal\nfarmers, pastoralists, fisher folk, forest dwellers, tribal and\nindigenous peoples who produce 80% of the world's food. But they\nare being denied access to land and natural resources.\"\nAGNES KALIBATA, PRESIDENT, ALLIANCE FOR A GREEN REVOLUTION\nIN AFRICA (AGRA), FORMER MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND ANIMAL\nRESOURCES IN RWANDA\n\"Food systems are often designed with an end in mind; be it\nfood security, better incomes, better livelihoods, or pure\nprofit motive.\n\"What we need is to refine the end, ensuring healthy,\naffordable and accessible diets for all. This is critical for\nbuilding household resilience.\n\"As food systems are complicated with no silver bullets,\ncreating the right policy environment should be prioritised.\nThis will enable farmers to diversify into more nutritious foods\nand embrace nature-based solutions.\n\"It will also create incentives for private-sector\ninvolvement in food systems.\u201d\nBRUCE CAMPBELL, DIRECTOR, THE CGIAR RESEARCH PROGRAM ON\nCLIMATE CHANGE, AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SECURITY (CCAFS)\n\"In low-income countries, the governments need to provide an\nenabling framework to facilitate orders of magnitude more\ninvestment by the private sector in fostering local and national\nfood value chains to both meet needs of rising urban populations\nand changing diets, as well as to tap into smallholder farming\noperations.\n\"The unacceptable alternative is a massive increase in food\nimports.\"\n(Reporting By Thin Lei Win @thinink, Editing by Chris Michaud.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, climate\nchange, women's and LGBT+ rights, human trafficking, and\nproperty rights.

        "text": "By Emma Batha\nLONDON, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - An estimated 10\nto 15 million people are not recognised as nationals by any\ncountry, often depriving them of basic rights most of the world\ntakes for granted such as education, healthcare, housing and\njobs.\nThe U.N. refugee agency is hosting a major intergovernmental\nmeeting in Geneva on Monday to assess progress at the midpoint\nof its #Ibelong campaign which aims to end statelessness by\n2024. Here are examples of stateless populations:\n\nMYANMAR/BANGLADESH: In 1982, Buddhist-majority Myanmar\npassed a citizenship law that effectively rendered stateless\nmost Rohingya, who are Muslim and of South Asian descent.\nEthnic violence has driven many to leave, but hundreds of\nthousands remain in Myanmar. There are about 900,000 Rohingya in\nneighbouring Bangladesh and smaller populations across Asia.\nSome are sold into slavery on fishing boats and plantations.\n\nIVORY COAST: Ivory Coast is home to 692,000 stateless\npeople. Many are descended from migrants from neighbouring\ncountries who were encouraged to work on Ivory Coast's coffee\nand cotton plantations in the 20th century.\nAt least a quarter of Ivory Coast's population is estimated\nto be of foreign descent, and the question of who is or is not\nIvorian helped fuel two civil wars in the West African country.\n\nTHAILAND: Nearly 479,000 people are stateless, including\nmembers of ethnic hill tribes such as the Yao, Hmong and Karen\nwho live in the mountainous border with Myanmar and Laos, and\nthe semi-nomadic \"Sea Gypsies\" along the Andaman coast.\n\nESTONIA/LATVIA: When the Soviet Union broke up, many ethnic\nRussians remained in the new Baltic states and were defined as\n\"non-citizens\".\nNearly 221,000 stateless people live in Latvia and 78,000 in\nEstonia, mainly ethnic Russians who have trouble obtaining\ncitizenship and at times face discrimination.\n\nSYRIA: In 1962, many Kurds in the northeast were stripped of\ncitizenship, a move Human Rights Watch described as part of a\nplan to \"Arabise\" the resource-rich region.\nBefore the civil war, there were an estimated 300,000\nstateless Kurds in Syria, many of whom were promised nationality\nby President Bashar al-Assad in reaction to the 2011 uprising.\nU.N. data suggests the number fell to 160,000, but this may\nbe partly because many fled the war.\nHuman rights experts have warned that babies born to Syrian\nrefugee women in Lebanon and Jordan could end up stateless.\n\nKUWAIT: Stateless people are known as Bidoon, which is short\nfor bidoon jinsiya meaning \"without nationality\" in Arabic. Some\ntrace their origins to nomadic tribes that once moved freely\naround the Gulf region.\nThere are about 92,000 Bidoon in Kuwait, according to U.N.\ndata, but some estimates are much higher. They are often barred\nfrom free education, healthcare and many jobs.\n\nNEPAL: Although Nepal says it does not have a stateless\npopulation, experts on statelessness believe many people,\npossibly hundreds of thousands, may be affected.\nPart of the problem derives from a law banning women married\nto foreigners from passing their nationality to their children.\nThere is also a stateless population of people who were expelled\nby Bhutan in the 1990s.\n\nDOMINICAN REPUBLIC: A 2013 court ruling, along with earlier\nchanges to nationality laws aimed at tackling illegal migration,\nhas left many stateless, mostly people of Haitian descent who\nwere born in Dominican Republic.\nIn 2015, there were about 134,000 stateless people,\naccording to U.N. data, but the figures are being updated.\n\nIRAQ: There are about 47,500 stateless people who include\nBidoon and Faili Kurds, an ethnic group that historically live\nboth sides of the Iraq-Iran border.\nMore than 100,000 Faili Kurds had their nationality revoked\nin 1980 under the Ba'ath regime. Although many have since had\ntheir nationality reinstated, others remain stateless.\n\nEUROPE: Tens of thousands of stateless Roma - an ethnic\ngroup with origins in India - are thought to live in central,\neastern and southern Europe. With the break-up of Czechoslovakia\nand Yugoslavia, successor states claimed they belonged\nelsewhere.\nOther Roma in Kosovo and Bosnia have become stateless due to\nwar-time displacement.\nRoma are often unable to register their children's births or\nhold official property titles. This can make it hard to prove\nwhere they are from.\n\nVENEZUELA: Some children born to Venezuelan parents who have\nfled to other countries amid a political and economic crisis at\nhome are at increased risk of statelessness.\n(Reporting by Emma Batha @emmabatha, Editing by Claire Cozens.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

Devine, assistant geography\nprofessor at Texas State University and co-author of the\nstudies, said in a statement.\nProtected mangrove and wetland areas in coastal parts of\nHonduras and Costa Rica are \"attractive for supplying maritime\nroutes and warehousing cocaine\", researchers wrote.\nEnvironmental degradation caused by drug trafficking leads\nto losses of about $215 million annually in natural and cultural\nresources across Central America's protected forest areas,\nshowed estimates by report co-author Bernardo Aguilar-Gonzalez.\n\"That is more than double the conservation budget the\nregion's governments allocate to the forest areas,\" noted\nAguilar-Gonzalez, who heads Fundacion Neotropica, a Costa Rican\nnonprofit that promotes community management of natural\nresources.\nEnsuring forest communities have secure land tenure,\nincluding collective land titles, and allowing them to decide\nhow their land should be managed could help deter trafficking\nand slow deforestation, researchers said.\nAreas that are managed by communities record \"very low\nforest losses\", they added.\n\"Investing in community land rights and participatory\ngovernance in protected areas is a key strategy to combat drug\ntrafficking and climate change simultaneously,\" Aguilar-Gonzalez\nsaid in a statement.\nForest protection has come under the spotlight as a low-cost\nway to keep climate change in check because trees store\nplanet-warming carbon. They release it when they are burned or\nrot.\nDeforestation rates have risen in the world's tropical\nregions, while Latin American countries have also been\nstruggling to curb forest fires in the Amazon this year.\nThe forest research was presented at a meeting in Costa Rica\nthis week to examine progress on the 2015 Paris Agreement to\ntackle climate change, including commitments to cut greenhouse\ngas emissions, ahead of December's U.N. climate talks in Chile.\n(Reporting by Anastasia Moloney @anastasiabogota, Editing by\nMegan Rowling.

High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said.\n\"So far 14 states have pledged 6,611 places of\nresettlement...That's all,\" Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR special\nenvoy for the central Mediterranean situation, told a briefing.\nCanada, Norway and Italy are among them, while Niger and\nRwanda have offered others temporary sanctuary, he said.\n\"There are many countries that could offer places of\nresettlement and that do not,\" he added.\nLibya has become the main conduit for Africans fleeing war\nand poverty trying to reach Europe since former leader Muammar\nGaddafi was toppled in 2011, though the number of crossings\ndropped sharply from 2017 amid a European Union-backed push to\nblock arrivals.\nLibya is host to 45,000 registered refugees and\nasylum-seekers, as well as an estimated 650,000 migrants, many\nof whom have found jobs there, Cochetel said.\nMore than 5,000 refugees and migrants are held in 19\nofficial detention facilities, some controlled by armed groups,\nas well as an unknown number in squalid centres run by\ntraffickers, he said. Rights groups say abuses are rife\nincluding beating and forced labour.\nDetainees include those who left on boats for Europe and\nwere brought back by the Libyan Coast Guard, Cochetel said,\nunderlining it is not a safe country of asylum.\n\"And you have desperate individuals who go to detention\ncentres, sometimes they pay to get inside detention centres.\nSometimes they feel better protected in a detention centre than\noutside,\" Cochetel said.\n\"Because some nationalities outside detention centres are\ntargeted by human traffickers, are kidnapped, and then you have\nextortion, you have torture.\n\"Some people don\u2019t feel safe in many urban centres in Libya.\nSo some of them prefer to be detained, even if conditions are\nnot good in those detention centres. Others try to bribe their\nway to get inside the detention centre in the hope that UNHCR\nwill resettle them,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay)",

        "text": "By Sebastien Malo\nNIAMEY, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Abdulaziz,\nAminatu, Absatu, Abdulmanaf. Fahad. And, well, also Mansour.\nThey are the names Zeinab Garba has in mind for any future\nchildren she has.\nBut for now the mother of two has decided to set aside plans\nfor more offspring by using a contraceptive, to give a better\nfuture to Rachid, her restless 3-year-old boy, and her newborn\nson Bilyaminou, mostly a passionate sleeper for now.\n\"I'm proud to wear the (contraceptive) implant,\" said Garba,\n20.\nIn a country with the world's highest birth rate per woman,\nhers is an uncommon move and, to some, a controversial one.\nBut environmentalists and youth activists in Niger hope it\nis one more families will embrace, to help reduce threats from\nthe destructive effects of a changing climate.\nClimate change has meant Niger has seen a swift rise in\ntemperatures and less abundant water flows in rivers, in\naddition to more intense droughts and floods, said Issa Lele, a\nmeteorologist with the United Nations Development Programme.\nThat is a growing threat to food and water supplies - and\nthe pressures heighten as the nation's population booms, with\neach woman having on average 7.6 children, said Sani Ayouba, the\ndirector of environmental group Young Volunteers for the\nEnvironment.\n\"We're not saying to stop having children,\" Ayouba, who has\nthree offspring of his own, said at a September meeting with\nlocal non-profit leaders, prompting a wave of laughter.\nInstead, he said, his group advocates the use of\ncontraceptives to slow the rate of births - a relief to one\nlistener who said he was expecting his fifth child.\nAround the world, a rising global population is increasing\npressure on the world's limited resources, with every additional\nperson in need of food, transport, energy and other resources\nthat drive climate change.\nThat pressure is worst in the richest countries, where each\nadditional person consumes far more resources than an added\nchild in a poorer country.\nBut very high birthrates in places like Niger also mean the\ncountry's own limited resources must be shared among more people\n- a particular problem as climate change disrupts farming and\nherding, threatening food supplies.\n\nEFFECTIVE - BUT CONTROVERSIAL\nAt the clinic where Garba was getting a contraceptive\nimplant on a September afternoon, in the district of Talladje in\nNiamey, herds of cows made their way to pasture just outside.\nShe breathed deeply when a midwife poked two tiny holes in\nher arm with a needle and slid in the small, elongated implant.\nThe five-minute procedure will give her three years without\na pregnancy, with a 99% effectiveness rate, the midwife said.\nThe pill is by far the most popular birth control method in\nNiger, but at this clinic of the international charity Marie\nStopes it is an implant, placed under the skin, that most women\nseek, said Adama Abdoulaye, a doctor who coordinates the clinic.\nMore women like Garba streamed in and out of the center's\nwaiting room, glancing at soap operas playing on the television.\nNigerien authorites back some aspects of family planning,\nand have begun to allocate money toward the push, said Issoufou\nHarou, director of family planning at Niger's Ministry of Public\nHealth.\nBut a national budget of 200 million FCFA ($340,000) for\npurchasing contraceptives doesn't go far enough, said Salamatou\nTraore, president of the Coalition of Stakeholders for the\nRepositioning of Family Planning in Niger.\nEven that budget - and Garba's tiny implant - raise big\nquestions in this highly devout Islamic society, however.\nSome 99% of Nigerians are Muslim, census data shows, and\nIslam does not advocate limiting the number of children in a\nfamily if they are well cared for, said Sita Amadou of the\nIslamic Association of Niger, the chief Islamic organisation in\nthe country.\nThat complicates the ambitious plans of environmental\nactivists who since last year have been working to spread family\nplanning as a buffer against the effects of climate change in\nNiger.\nThe activists have met with parliamentarians and cabinet\nministers, as well as a range of community groups.\nAt a recent gathering, in a small, damp room in Niamey, a\ndozen representatives listened, silently at first, to the pitch\nabout a novel way of fighting growing climate pressures.\n\"It's not just about investing in agriculture so that it is\norganic or sustainable but also in contraceptive methods and\nfamily planning everywhere,\" said Ayouba, who spoke alongside\nIssa Garba, who heads the Nigerien Youth Network on Climate\nChange.\nBut worries quickly arose from a handful of listeners.\nMuslim authorities will not accept the proposal, one participant\ncommented.\nAyouba and Garba said current projections - which show the\npopulation of Niger tripling by 2050, from 22 million people\ntoday, according to U.N. estimates - are untenable.\nBy some estimates, Niamey, Niger's sleepy capital of 1\nmillion, could become one of the 10 largest cities in Africa by\n2100, with as many as 50 million residents as a result of\npopulation growth and urbanisation, European scientists said in\nthe journal Earth's Future earlier this year.\nThe country's 2012-2020 Action Plan for Family Planning\ncommits to making contraceptives available to half of the\npopulation by next year - though their availability is less than\n20% for now, government data shows.\nBut Niger's population growth rate is not simply the result\nof lack of access to contraception, said Abdou Batouati, a\nresearcher at the Institute for Research in Human Sciences at\nNiamey's Abdou Moumouni University.\n\"Culturally, in Niger, women space out their births at a\nrate of a child every two years,\" he said.\nIn the city's open markets, among bars of soap, stalls of\nlemons and the calls of salesmen, some vendors sell boxes of\ncontraceptive pills, stacked in colorful towers atop trays\ncarried on the vendors' heads.\nThe Pharmacy du Point, in the affluent district of Plateau,\nalso sells them. On a table, the manager spreads out rectangular\npeach, blue and orange boxes of the contraceptives, which sell\nfor anywhere from 300 to 3,060 FCFA ($0.50 to $5.10).\nBut some people think that the pill \"is a way to get people\ninto debauchery,\" said Adama Jonathna, a midwife at the clinic\nthat helped Garba with her contraceptive implant.\n\nIN THE PLAN?\nNiger is currently a national plan on how it will adapt to\nclimate threats, aiming to integrate those efforts into\ngovernment planning and budgeting.\nIn what would be a pioneering move, it may include a section\nnoting the links between boosting family planning and lessening\nclimate change impacts.\n\"I do not mind doing it, but before that I need to have the\napproval of my officials\" to do so, said Gousmane Moussa, the\nplan's liaison to national authorities.\nHe said U.N. guidelines that inform such adaptation plans do\nnot urge family planning be a part of them.\nShould Niger make clear the link between reducing birthrates\nand lowering climate risks, it might be the first such case in a\nnational plan, said Christian Ledwell, an adaptation plan\nspecialist at the International Institute for Sustainable\nDevelopment, a Canadian think tank.\nBut the idea ruffles plenty of feathers in the Sahelian\ncountry.\nWhile preparing for the afternoon prayer on the campus of\nthe Abdou Moumouni University, Laminou Adamou Abdoul Azize - a\nmember of the Association of Muslim Students of Niger - said the\nthe idea of \u200b\u200ba family planning awareness campaign left him\nlukewarm.\nIslam already demands that births be spaced by 30 months,\nmore than the World Health Organization recommendation of 24\nmonths, said Azize, who at 30 has two children and says he will\ntake as many as God provides.\nSeydou Boubacar, the former head of the Islamic Association\nof Niger, offered a blunter rationale for opposing family\nplanning.\n\"Non-profits, when speaking of family planning, encourage\nyouth to debauchery,\" he insisted.\n\"As soon as they speak of spacing out births, all they do is\nshow rubbers, and that is not okay.\"\n(Reporting by Sebastien Malo @sebastienmalo, Editing by Laurie\nGoering.

        "text": "By Adaobi Nwaubani and Sarah Shearman\nABUJA/LONDON, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When\nOlamide Ayeni-Babajide discovered an expensive ornament she\npurchased on a trip abroad was made of old corn husk it opened\nher eyes to the potential of Nigeria's own waste problem.\nIn 2016 she founded Pearl Recycling, which remodels solid\nwaste such as old tyres into furniture in Lagos, Africa's most\npopulous city with 21 million people and home to one of the\nworld's largest garbage sites.\nThe social enterprise \u2013 a business that aims to do good \u2013 is\nalso looking to tackle Nigeria's youth unemployment problem,\ntraining hundreds of young locals to recycle disused materials,\nwith most them going on to set up their own waste ventures.\n\"Nigeria is a good place for social entrepreneurs because\nthere are diverse problems to be solved,\" said Ayeni-Babajide.\nThe Thomson Reuters Foundation's second global poll on the\nbest country to be a social entrepreneur found the three African\nnations among the world's 45 biggest economies surveyed -\nNigeria, Egypt and South Africa - failed to make the top 20.\nBut Nigeria came sixth when about 900 social enterprise\nexperts were asked where young people are playing a key role in\nthe growing sector. Egypt came fourth and South Africa 34th in\nthe youth ranking in the poll, supported by Deutsche Bank.\nIn Nigeria - a young country where the median age is about\n18 - young people are rising to find business solutions to\nchallenges ranging from poverty to environmental and cultural\nissues \u2013 from illiteracy to pollution \u2013 neglected by the\ngovernment.\nFacing a youth unemployment crisis \u2013 with more than half of\n15-35 year olds out of work or not in full-time jobs \u2013 a new\ngeneration of social entrepreneurs wants to create opportunities\nand economic prosperity themselves.\nPASSION AND ENERGY\nFemi Taiwo, executive director of LEAP Africa, said\nencouragement from faith-based organisations, motivational\nspeakers, an array of local and international programmes and\ncompetitions for young leaders has helped pave the way.\n\"These initiatives and many more put a spotlight on young\npeople making a change, and inspired many more to jump on the\nbandwagon,\" said Taiwo, whose Lagos-based youth leadership\nnon-profit provides free training for social innovators.\nBut with this zeal for social entrepreneurship comes risks.\n\"The enthusiasm, the energy, the drive of young people is\nincomparable,\" said Atinuke Lebile, 31, founder of Ibadan-based\nsocial enterprise Cato Foods.\n\"However, young people often lack experience and the\npatience to learn,\" added Lebile, whose biotechnology business\naims to reduce malnutrition and poverty by creating fortified\nfood products, such as custard enriched with vitamins A and C.\nIn addition to young people, women are increasingly well\nrepresented in leadership positions in social enterprises in\nNigeria, which jumped to joint ninth place on this issue from\n40th in the inaugural global poll in 2016.\nAyeni-Babajide, 36, who worked as an engineer in a\nmale-dominated sector for almost a decade before founding Pearl\nRecycling, finds Nigerians are gradually getting used to women\nin leadership positions.\n\"Women now know their rights and power they possess,\" she\nsaid, but added that women still found it hard to access funds.\n\"The majority of laid down rules are favouring men,\nespecially access to capital. Women need access to funds and an\nenabling environment devoid of gender profiling to thrive.\"\nLike Nigeria, in Egypt there has also been a concerted push\nto support young social entrepreneurs, especially since the\ncountry's 2011 uprising, said Iman Bibars of Ashoka Arab World,\na non-profit organisation that supports social entrepreneurs.\nEgypt, like Nigeria, has a large youth population with 34%\nof people under the age of 14 compared to 44% in Nigeria,\naccording to World Bank data from 2018.\n\"After the Arab Spring there was a lot of interest in the\nyouth, there were a lot of programmes by the government and\ninternational donors and CSR [corporate social responsibility]\nin trying to figure out how to support young people,\" she said.\nThis year Ashoka Arab World launched a Young Changemakers\nscheme with the British Council and social enterprise Red Ochre\nto help support females aged 16-20 from rural Egypt develop\nsocial enterprise ideas.\nEgypt rose to 22nd place from 29th three years ago when\nasked if women were well represented in social enterprises.\nSouth Africa was in 23rd place, also up from 29th.\n\"The reason why young people are excited is it gives them an\nopportunity to be leaders, it gives them an opportunity to be of\nhelp to others and recognition, and this is something that young\npeople did not have before,\" said Bibars.\n\"Since there are so many social problems in the country and\npoverty, there is a lot of space for them to innovate.\"\n(Reporting by Sarah Shearman @Shearmans.

        "text": "By Chitra Nagarajan\nMAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Oct 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -\nK ellu became pregnant after a Nigerian soldier offered her food\nand shelter in exchange for sex. But the destitute teenager -\nwho lost her family when Boko Haram militants attacked her\nvillage two years earlier - did not want to have the baby.\nAfter moving to a camp for displaced people in northeastern\nBorno state, where she relied on neighbours for food,\n18-year-old Kellu wanted an abortion but did not know where to\ngo - like a growing number of women since the Islamist\ninsurgency began.\n\"If I continue with this pregnancy, it will ruin my life,\"\nKellu, who guessed she was about two months pregnant, told the\nThomson Reuters Foundation, sitting on a mat in a building\npock-marked with bullet holes.\n\"Everyone will know what I did. They will stigmatise me for\nhaving a baby without a husband. Also, I have no money to take\ncare of myself. How am I supposed to look after a child?\" asked\nKellu, who declined to publish her real name.\nNigeria has some of the world's most restrictive abortion\nlaws, which only allow abortion to save the life of the mother.\nThe Johns Hopkins University estimates that 2.7 million\nabortions are carried out in Nigeria each year, the majority\nperformed secretly and in dangerous conditions, with poor,\nuneducated women most at risk.\nHealth and aid workers say unsafe abortions have surged in\nnorthern Nigeria since the start of the Boko Haram conflict in\n2009, which has driven 1.8 million Nigerians from their homes,\naccording to the United Nations.\nAt least 40 women and girls come in for emergency\npost-abortion care each month, said Aminu, a senior nurse in a\nbusy government clinic in Yobe state - west of Borno state -\nabout three times the average of 10 to 15 a month a decade\nearlier.\nNigeria has the fourth highest maternal mortality rate\nglobally, according to the World Health Organization, with about\n100 women and girls dying each day.\nDeath rates in the northeast - where clinics and hospitals\nhave been destroyed as armed groups fight to create an Islamic\ncaliphate - are the worst in Nigeria, government data shows.\nWomen and girls go to pharmacies, vendors of locally made\ndrugs and older women to terminate pregnancies, using\nmedication, herbs or tools like sticks, Aminu said.\nFatima, is was in her 40s, went to an aunt who gave her\nherbs that caused a miscarriage in a few hours.\n\"It wasn't a choice, I had to end it,\" said Fatima, who\ndeclined to publish her real name, who was raising five children\nand four grandchildren in a displaced camp in Borno state.\n\"Men say it's immorality. But they are not the ones who have\nto give birth and look after the babies. When your children are\ntelling you they are hungry, how can you have another one?\" she\nasked, adding foetuses are often found in the camp's toilets.\nNigerian officials insist the law is upheld.\n\"Regardless of circumstances, abortion is prohibited except\nfor medical reasons,\" said Ali Grema, deputy director of\nemergency medical response in the health ministry in Borno\nstate. \"It is not allowed for social reasons.\"\nTABOO\nWith many husbands missing, detained or dead, more women are\nhaving sex outside marriage, aid workers said.\nWhile some women choose to get into new relationships, the\nUnited Nations has recorded thousands of cases of sexual\nviolence and transactional sex, particularly by women and girls\nwho lack food, shelter or money.\n\"Many people who are displaced live with hosts who take\nadvantage of them. If they say no, they may lose their housing,\"\nsaid Maryam Aje, head of the African Youth for Peace Development\nand Empowerment Foundation, which gives women business grants.\nPointing to a poster in a Maiduguri camp encouraging women\nto space their children, Hadiza - a nurse working in a nearby\nclinic - said family planning messages focused on married women\nbecause of conservative attitudes.\n\"Women will ask for contraception but they don't want\nhusbands to know,\" said Hadiza, who declined to publish her real\nname. \"(They) come at night, when nobody is around.\"\nHadiza said she often received calls or visits from young\nwomen after working hours, asking for the morning-after pill.\n\"It's better to prevent such pregnancies than try and deal\nwith them when they happen,\" she said.\nMany girls do not even know sex can make them pregnant, said\nLucy Dlama of Women in New Nigeria, which supports rape\nsurvivors with health care.\n\"Our culture means it is taboo for parents to discuss sex\neducation with their daughters,\" said Dlama, who encourages\nmothers to teach girls about their bodies. \"They can think it is\nstomach pain, give birth and then panic.\"\nAminu, the nurse, said most of his patients needing\npost-abortion care were teenagers who tried to abort after\nseveral months because they did not know they were pregnant or\nhid it.\n\"They do not die if we admit them to hospital,\" he said.\n\"But there are so many more cases where women and girls take\nherbs on their own, do not come to the hospital and die because\nthey do not want to expose themselves.\"\nPregnancy outside marriage is a taboo, even when it is the\nresult of rape by soldiers, militias or camp officials.\n\"They consider you to be a whore and your child to be a\nbastard. You have spoiled your family name,\" Aminu said.\nAnother factor is a decades-old U.S. government policy,\nknown as the global \"gag rule\" and reinstated by President\nDonald Trump in 2017, barring clinics that receive federal funds\nfrom talking to patients about abortion.\n\"We see young girls and women requesting abortion,\" said one\naid worker who worked to support health clinics across Borno\nstate and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\"But we are constrained by concerns about legal risks,\ncommunity reactions and by our U.S. funding which prohibits us\nfrom providing abortion information or services.\"\nTurning desperate women away is dangerous, said Hauwa\nShekarau of IPAS, an advocacy group promoting safe abortion.\n\"If the hospital will not help, she will go elsewhere - even\nif it is unsafe. We bury our heads in the sand and women\ncontinue to die,\" she said.\n(Reporting by Chitra Nagarajan; Editing by Katy Migiro.

        "text": "By Thin Lei Win\nROME, Oct 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Farmers around\nthe world are losing up to 20% of the food they produce every\nyear but action can be taken to reduce this, according to the\nUnited Nations on Monday as it quantified such losses for the\nfirst time.\nA combination of causes, ranging from harvesting and\nhandling practices, to lack of infrastructure and market prices\nto pests, diseases and climatic conditions, contributed to these\nlosses, said the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\nThis \"means that land and water resources have been wasted,\npollution created and greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted to no\npurpose\", said FAO Director-General Qu Dongyu in a report\nreleased ahead of World Food Day on Oct. 16.\nAn earlier, widely-cited figure estimated about a third of\nthe world's food - about 1.3 billion tonnes - was lost or wasted\nannually but that was a rough figure including estimates for\nlosses along the whole supply chain, according to the FAO.\nThe FAO said the latest numbers, which showed 14% losses\nglobally, focused on losses between harvest and markets and\nshowed variations among the world's regions and commodities.\nCentral and southern Asia have the highest level of food\nlosses of 20% followed by northern America and Europe at more\nthan 15%. Australia and New Zealand have the lowest at about 6%.\n\"This number is important because now we can measure the\neffects of different policies to reduce losses and we can track\nit over time to see if we're improving or not,\" said the FAO's\nAssistant Director-General Maximo Torero Cullen.\nWith the right policies the world \"can eliminate a\nsignificant amount of that 14% food loss\" but this had costs and\ndepended on lawmakers, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\"Reductions in the early stages of the food supply chain is\nmost effective in addressing food security or natural resources\nstress, but reduction of food waste by consumers and retailers\nis the best to reduce GHG emissions,\" he added.\nThe findings show losses of one in four roots, tubers and\noil-bearing crops, such as cassava and potatoes, and more than\none in five fruits and vegetables, but less than 10% in cereals\nand pulses.\nSlashing these losses on the farm could increase food\navailability for small-scale farmers in low-income countries who\nmight also make money selling the surplus, but a glut in produce\ncould depress prices as well as demand, the report warned.\nAlso some losses were easier to address than others. Making\nair-conditioned storage available in rural locations without\nproper roads or electricity would take time but others might\nonly require small adjustments, Torero Cullen said.\nFor example in Ghana, switching from conventional bags to\ntriple-layer bags with an air-tight seal can protect cassava\nchips and maize from insects and fungus, according to\nWashington-based International Food Policy Research Institute.\nNew technologies could also help. California-based start-up\nApeel Sciences produces a plant-based coating that comes in\npowder form and, when applied with water, can double the shelf\nlife of fruits and vegetables without refrigeration.\nIt is being tested on mangoes and cassava in Africa.\n\"Our hope is that with better information and better quality\ndata, we can accelerate this process of reducing food loss,\"\nsaid Torero Cullen. \"This is a big step towards action.\"\n(Reporting By Thin Lei Win @thinink, Editing by Belinda\nGoldsmith\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, climate\nchange, women's and LGBT+ rights, human trafficking, and\nproperty rights.

        "text": "By Nellie Peyton\nNEW YORK, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda on\nThursday announced plans for a bill that would impose the death\npenalty on homosexuals, following plans announced by Brunei\nearlier this year to do the same.\nSame-sex relations are illegal in at least 68 countries\naround the world, according to the International Lesbian, Gay,\nBisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA).\nIn addition to Uganda and Brunei, here are eight countries\nthat have recently moved to roll back LGBT+ rights.\n\n1. United States\nThe United States began implementing a ban on transgender\npeople serving in the military this year, after President Donald\nTrump announced the change in 2017.\nTrump cited medical costs as one reason for rolling back a\n2016 policy of his predecessor Barack Obama, which had allowed\ntransgender people to serve openly for the first time and also\nreceive medical care to transition genders.\n\n2. Russia\nRussia fined its first minor last year under a so-called\n\"gay propaganda\" law that has been increasingly used to repress\nthe LGBT+ community.\nThe 2013 law makes illegal any event or act regarded by the\nauthorities as an attempt to promote homosexuality to minors. It\nhas been used to stop gay pride marches and detain gay rights\nactivists.\n\n3. Poland\nPoland's ruling party leader condemned gay pride marches\nthis year and said the rule of law should be used to regulate\nwhat he called a \"travelling theatre\".\nAhead of elections later this month, the conservative Law\nand Justice (PiS) party has used its anti-LGBT+ stance as a key\ncampaign issue, which critics say has fomented violence toward\nthe gay community.\n\n4. Indonesia\nIndonesia has drafted a law that would ban gay sex, which\nparliament delayed voting on last month amid protests.\nThe proposed revisions to the criminal code also include a\nban on sex outside of marriage, a four-year jail term for\nabortions in the absence of a medical emergency or rape and a\nprison term for black magic.\n\n5. Nigeria\nNigeria passed a bill in 2014 that criminalized same-sex\nrelationships with penalties of up to 14 years in prison.\nAuthorities charged 43 people with homosexual acts in one\ncase in 2017, ordering most to undergo monitoring and \"sexual\nrehabilitation.\"\n\n6. Malaysia\nMalaysia's LGBT+ community has faced growing persecution,\nwith two women caned in public for \"attempting lesbian sex\" in\nthe state of Terengganu last year.\nPrime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the leader of a new\ngovernment elected last year, has said the country cannot accept\nsame-sex marriage or LGBT+ rights.\n\n7. Chad\nChad introduced a new penal code in 2017 with light prison\nsentences and fines for same-sex relations which had not been\nexplicitly criminalized before, although there was a law\ncondemning \"acts against nature\", according to the ILGA.\nAn earlier draft of the legislation from 2014 would have\ncriminalized gay sex with up to 20 years in prison.\n\n8. Slovakia\nSlovakia inserted a definition of traditional marriage in\nits constitution in 2014.\nIn 2015 the country held a referendum which would have\nstrengthened its ban on marriage and child adoption by same-sex\ncouples, but it failed to pass on low voter turnout.\n(Writing by Nellie Peyton; Editing by Chris Michaud.

        "text": "* S.Korea, Japan relations at a low over wartime history,\ntrade\n* Japanese, South Korean PMs meet in highest level talks in\na year\n* Abe, Lee agree on importance of cooperating on North Korea\n* Abe says Korean court ruling \"breaks down\" framework for\nties\n* Disputed islets, forced asset sales threaten relations\nfurther\n(Adds Abe quote, Japan government official comment)\nBy Kiyoshi Takenaka\nTOKYO, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\nand South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon agreed on Thursday\non the importance of cooperating on North Korea and other\nissues, seeking to rebuild relations amid a bitter feud over\nhistory and trade.\nBut there was scant sign of real progress and Abe reiterated\nthat South Korea would need to keep its promises for ties\nbetween the two Asian allies of Washington to improve.\nRelations between Tokyo and Seoul have deteriorated to their\nlowest in decades since South Korea's top court last October\nordered some Japanese firms to compensate Koreans forced to work\nin their wartime mines and factories.\nJapan, which says the matter was settled by a 1965 treaty,\ncalls the decision a violation of international law, and the\nfeud has spilled over into trade and security matters.\nAbout 100 journalists were present at the start of talks in\nTokyo, the highest-level meeting between the two sides since the\nrow flared. The meeting began with a handshake but no smiles.\nAbe urged Seoul to keep its promises - a reference to the\n1965 treaty - in order to restore relations, according to\nstatement issued by Japan's foreign ministry.\n\"Our two nations are important neighbours for each other,\nand keeping in contact over North Korea, bilateral relations and\nour ties with the United States are quite important,\" Abe was\nquoted as telling Lee.\n\"Relations are currently in quite a severe state but should\nnot be left that way. If South Korea can keep bilateral\npromises, that could be a chance to return to a healthy\nrelationship,\" Abe added.\nThe statement also quoted Lee as saying he shared the view\nthat dialogue was important, while a parallel statement from\nSouth Korea's foreign ministry said Lee agreed relations should\nnot be left in their current difficult state.\nAbe also repeated Tokyo's stance that the South Korean court\nruling overturned the basis of two-way ties.\n\u201cAbe said the South Korean top court ruling is in clear\nviolation of international law and ... fundamentally breaks down\nthe legal framework for Japan-South Korea relations,\" Japanese\nDeputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Naoki Okada told reporters.\nIn a sign that gaps remain wide, Lee told Abe: \"South Korea\nhas also respected and complied with the 1965 Treaty on Basic\nRelations and Claims, and will continue to do so,\" according to\nSeoul's statement.\nLee, who was in Tokyo to attend Japanese Emperor Naruhito's\nenthronement ceremony this week, delivered to Abe a personal\nletter from South Korean President Moon Jae-in in which Moon\ncalled for attempts to resolve the pending bilateral issues,\nSouth Korea's Yonhap news agency reported.\nMoon and Abe have not held a summit in more than a year and\nthe statements made no mention of any meeting planned between\nthe two.\nA Japanese government official questioned whether Thursday's\nmeeting would lead to a breakthrough. \"It depends on their\n(South Korea's) deeds, not words,\" the official told Reuters.\n\nDIFFICULT HISTORY\nThe animosity between Japan and South Korea is linked to the\nhistory of Japan's 1910-45 colonisation of the Korean peninsula,\nthe mobilisation of forced labour at companies and women in\nwartime military brothels, and a row over the ownership of\nislets in the sea between the two nations.\nEarlier this year, the dispute escalated when Japan\ntightened export controls on materials vital for South Korean\nchipmakers. It then dropped Seoul from a list of countries\neligible for fast-track exports, steps angrily denounced by\nSouth Korea.\nThe spat has prompted protests in South Korea, where\nJapanese companies and products have been boycotted, and trade\nbetween the two countries has slowed sharply.\nIn August, South Korea announced it would scrap a military\nintelligence-sharing pact with Japan when it expires next month,\njust as the allies face rising tensions over North Korea's\nnuclear weapons programme and increased competition from China\nand Russia.\nFurther potential flashpoints loom.\nThousands of South Korean students and activists are\nexpected to gather on Friday to celebrate \"Dokdo Day\". Dokdo is\nthe Korean name for islets claimed by South Korea and by Japan,\nwhich calls them Takeshima.\nSouth Korea is also planning to order asset sales of the\nJapanese companies found liable for damages under last year's\nforced labour rulings as early as December, which could further\nsour bilateral relations, analysts said.\n\"Precautions must be taken to prevent that,\" said Yang\nKee-ho, professor of Japanese Studies at Sungkonghoe University.\n(Reporting by Kiyoshi Takenaka in Tokyo and Joyce Lee in Seoul;\nwriting by Linda Sieg and Elaine Lies; Editing by Lincoln Feast)",

        "text": "By Hyonhee Shin\nSEOUL, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The animosity between Japan and\nSouth Korea is entwined with the history of Japan's 1910-45\noccupation of the Korean peninsula, the mobilisation of forced\nlabour at companies and women in wartime brothels, and a row\nover the ownership of islets in the sea between the two nations.\nHere is an outline of the issues that bedevil their ties:\n\nFORCED LABOUR\nLast October, South Korea's Supreme Court ordered Japan's\nNippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp and Mitsubishi Heavy\nIndustries to compensate some wartime forced labourers.\nThe ruling infuriated Tokyo, which sees the former\nlabourers' right to reparation ceased under a 1965 treaty\nnormalising diplomatic ties.\nRelations deteriorated when Japan restricted exports of\nhigh-tech material to South Korea in July, while a group of\nformer labourers requested a court order to forcibly liquidate\nMitsubishi assets for compensation.\nThousands of South Koreans protested condemning what they\ncalled Japan's \"economic invasion.\"\nLast week, a commercial by Japanese clothing brand Uniqlo\nstirred a backlash in South Korea as mocking victims of forced\nlabour and comfort women, prompting a parody video featuring a\n90-year-old woman who worked for Mitsubishi to go viral.\nYang Kee-ho, a professor of Japanese Studies at Sungkonghoe\nUniversity in Seoul, said the two sides were far apart.\n\"But it could get even worse if the asset sale of Japanese\nfirms is materialised, so it's good to listen and talk to the\nJapanese to see if they can find a new, creative way out.\"\n\n'COMFORT WOMEN'\nReminders of Japan's rule are inflammatory for both sides,\nbut the issue of \"comfort women,\" a Japanese euphemism for\nwomen, many of them Korean, forced into wartime brothels, is\nparticularly contentious.\nMany surviving South Korean victims demand Japan's formal\napology and compensation.\nJapan says the matter of compensation for the women was\nsettled under the 1965 treaty.\nIn 2015, South Korea and Japan reached a settlement under\nwhich Tokyo issued an official apology and provided 1 billion\nyen ($9.23 million) to a fund to help the victims.\nTaking office two years later, South Korean President Moon\nJae-in dissolved the fund, effectively scrapping the agreement,\na move that analysts said convinced Japanese Prime Minister\nShinzo Abe the South Korean leader was deceitful.\nTokyo wants Seoul to remove a statue near the Japanese\nembassy in Seoul commemorating the comfort women, and another\nnext to the Japanese consulate in Busan.\nSome comfort women victims continue their weekly protest in\nfront of the embassy.\n\nISLETS\nThe two countries also have a territorial dispute which\nflared this month when South Korea flew fighter jets over a set\nof remote islands marking its Armed Forces Day.\nThe windswept volcanic islets, known as Dokdo in Korea and\nTakeshima in Japan, are controlled by Seoul with a small band of\ncoast guards although also claimed by Tokyo.\nThe cluster sit astride fertile fishing grounds and possibly\nenormous deposits of natural gas hydrate that could be worth\nbillions of dollars, experts say.\nThe territorial feud is emotional for Koreans, who say the\nislands, recorded as part of their territory since 512, were the\nfirst land seized by Japan as part of forcible occupation of the\npeninsula.\nJapan argues the islands were never part of Korea and it had\nestablished sovereignty by the mid-17th century as a stop-over\npoint for its fishermen.\nSeoul rejects Tokyo's proposal to refer the dispute to the\nInternational Court of Justice.\nIn 2017, Japan complained after Moon served visiting U.S.\nPresident Donald Trump a dish called \"Dokdo shrimp,\" and invited\na comfort women survivor to a banquet for Trump.\n($1 = 108.3400 yen)\n(Reporting by Hyonhee Shin; Additional reporting by Joyce Lee;\nEditing by Jack Kim; Raju Gopalakrishnan)",

        "text": "By Ashutosh Sharma\nBOBIYA, India, Oct 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When\nhalf a dozen trucks loaded with construction material screeched\nto a halt on their farms, Baryam Singh and fellow residents in\nthe Indian village of Bobiya sensed they were soon going to lose\nmore land to the military.\nThe farmers chased away the contractors and labourers with\nprotests and threats of deflated tyres, knowing it was only a\ntemporary reprieve.\n\"The military infrastructure has been growing in our village\nand our farmlands are shrinking,\" Singh told the Thomson Reuters\nFoundation, as other farmers sitting around him nodded.\n\"More than 50% of our agricultural land is under military\nlockdown,\" he said of the village on the border with Pakistan.\nOver the past 15 years, the Indian army and the country's\nBorder Security Force (BSF) have been acquiring land to fortify\ndefences in the border districts of Jammu and Kashmir, according\nto the Border Welfare Committee, a local organisation\ncampaigning for the rights of border residents.\nBoth India and Pakistan administer the disputed state of\nKashmir in part while claiming it in full.\nThe fertile land where Jammu and Kashmir meets Pakistan has\nbecome dotted with barbed wire and landmines, leaving hundreds\nof farmers cut off from their farms, often with no warning or\ncompensation, said Bobiya villagers.\n\"This is adding to the economic distress of farmers who\ndon't have alternative sources of livelihood,\" said Singh.\nAfter India revoked the autonomy of its portion of Kashmir\nin August, farmers in border areas now fear losing even more of\ntheir land to the military, according to ID Khajuria, an\nactivist who heads up the Jammu and Kashmir Forum for Peace and\nTerritorial Integrity.\nWith India bringing Jammu and Kashmir deeper into its fold,\nthe central government will have greater power to seize\nterritory in the border regions in the name of national\nsecurity, he warned.\n\"The local elected political representatives will now have a\nvery limited say in the functioning of the (Jammu and Kashmir)\ngovernment,\" Khajuria said.\nJammu divisional commissioner Sanjeev Verma said that all\nfarmers in Jammu province would eventually be paid for their\nland.\n\"Whatever new agricultural land is being acquired, the\nfarmers will get financial compensation,\" he said in a phone\ninterview.\nSome have already been compensated, he added, though he\ndeclined to specify how many.\n'I AM LANDLESS NOW'\nThe defence system includes a fence of about 900 km (560\nmiles) in length that sits several kilometres into India from\nthe border, slicing through villages and leaving vast tracts of\nfarmland on the other side of the fence towards Pakistan.\nIndia's government is also working on a \"Wall of Defence\"\nalong the border between India and Pakistan, according to the\nBorder Security Force.\nThe project consists of a 10-metre-high (32-foot) mud\nembankment to protect residents of India's border villages from\nfrequent ceasefire violations that both sides blame on each\nother.\nThere are also plans to install high-tech surveillance\nsystems to plug gaps where physical surveillance is not\npossible, India's ministry of home affairs announced last year.\nMembers of the Border Welfare Committee - which is based in\nthe city of K    athua - said that thousands of hectares of\nIndian farmland now sit untouched on the other side of the\nfence.\nTechnically, farmers can still get to their land, but the\ncheckpoints in the fence are opened only during specific times\nof day and farmers have to walk for hours to reach their fields,\nexplained Bharat Bhushan Sharma, the committee's vice president.\nEven if they do manage to successfully cultivate their\ncrops, \"there is always a threat of cross-border fire\", said\nSharma, who is also head of Bobiya village.\n\"And then (they) can't protect their crops from wild\nanimals.\"\nCommittee president Nanak Chand, 87, said he lost almost\neight hectares of land to the fence when it was first built in\n2004.\n\"Three months ago, the military acquired the remaining two\nhectares of farmland as well,\" he said. \"I am landless now.\"\nChand was given 3 million rupees ($42,000) as compensation,\nwhich he says is not enough to buy himself an equivalent piece\nof land in a peaceful part of the country.\nKhajuria agreed, saying that \"with developers and\nbusinessmen from other states rushing to Jammu and Kashmir, land\nprices are likely to soar and it would make it difficult for\npoor border residents to buy land in peaceful areas.\"\nIn December 2018, Chand filed a petition with the Jammu and\nKashmir High Court on behalf of farmers living in the border\nareas of the affected districts.\nThe petition called for the government to pay rent for\nfarmland on the Pakistan side of the fence and provide farmers\nwith compensation for each crop season during which their land\nremains uncultivated.\nThe Ministry of Home Affairs, the BSF and the local\nadministration have not yet filed their responses, according to\nlawyers representing the farmers.\nJugal Kishore Sharma, a member of the ruling Bharatiya\nJanata Party who represents the Jammu-Poonch parliamentary\nconstituency, could not specify how much of the land along the\nborder currently being used by the military is farmland.\nBut he said officials in the border districts are in the\nprocess of measuring that amount.\n\"Thereafter, the government will start paying rent to\nfarmers,\" he said in a phone interview.\nWAITING FOR PEACE\nOften times, when the border fence cuts through a farm, it\nalso isolates the village in which the farm is located, said\nMohammad Arif Khan, 67, head of Behrooti village in Poonch\ndistrict.\nAs a result, \"the villages (are) deprived of even the basic\nfacilities and infrastructure,\" he explained.\nThe huge razor-wire fence has turned Behrooti into what\nlocals have described as an open prison.\n\"Our village doesn't have roads and healthcare facilities.\nThere is no internet or mobile phone connectivity,\" said\nMohammad Nisar Khan, 30, another resident.\n\"A zoo is visited by people every day, but here the\noutsiders are not allowed. Socially, we are completely\nisolated.\"\nThe knowledge that the military plans to add high-tech\nsurveillance equipment to the fence is disheartening, said Khan,\nwho like many Indians living on the border is holding out hope\nthat the fence will one day be moved onto the border itself.\n\"We'll become permanent prisoners if the fence gets upgraded\nat its current location,\" he said.\nWhile the residents of Behrooti feel trapped in their\nvillage by the fence, others fear it will force them to leave\ntheir homes for good.\n\"There's little chance that our next generation will be in a\nposition to continue living here (at the border),\" said Meer\nChand, a rice farmer in Nanga village, 30 kilometres (18 miles)\nfrom Bobiya.\n\"We've lost hope that there will ever be peace between India\nand Pakistan. We have neither security of life nor livelihood.\"\n(Reporting by Ashutosh Sharma, Editing by Jumana Farouky and\nZoe Tabary.

        "text": "By Megan Rowling\nBARCELONA, Oct 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The Green\nClimate Fund, one of the main sources of finance for developing\nnations to tackle climate change, is hoping wealthy countries\nwill pledge between $9 billion and $10 billion to refill its\ncoffers at a conference in Paris on Friday.\nClimate finance analysts said the outcome would be key to\nbuilding trust with poorer states preparing more ambitious\nclimate action plans which are due to be submitted to the United\nNations by the end of 2020.\nEnvironment and development groups are calling for at least\n$15 billion in new commitments for the Green Climate Fund (GCF),\nsaying projects that may use up close to that amount are already\nin the pipeline, with needs only increasing as the planet warms.\nLucile Dufour, international policy advisor with Climate\nAction Network France, said the GCF replenishment was happening\n\"at a crucial point in the fight against climate change\", and\ncalled on donors to double their contributions at a minimum.\n\"This is a matter of justice and survival for developing\ncountries and the most vulnerable communities,\" she told\njournalists, noting the devastation from increasingly wild\nweather around the world.\nThe fund's executive director, Yannick Glemarec, told the\nThomson Reuters Foundation this week's meeting would be a\n\"success\" if pledges exceeded the $9.3 billion garnered at its\nfirst conference in 2014.\nSince late last year the fund has secured pledges of about\n$7.4 billion from 16 countries for 2020-2023, with large donors\nlike Germany, France and Britain doubling 2014 contributions.\nNew announcements from some other potentially large donors\nare expected to raise that figure on Friday, including Japan,\nItaly, Switzerland, Finland and Belgium.\n\"It is not easy right now for any kind of financial\ncontributors to dramatically increase their contribution because\nmost of them are facing real budgetary constraints,\" Glemarec\nsaid, noting some \"exceptional efforts\" to double donations.\nDespite total promises of just over $10 billion for the\nfund's first five years, U.S. President Donald Trump, a\nclimate-change sceptic, refused to deliver two-thirds of his\ncountry's  $3 billion pledge.\nCurrency fluctuations meanwhile further cut the actual total\navailable to the fund, to about $7.2 billion.\nGlemarec and others expressed hope the United States could\n\"re-engage\" with the fund in coming years.\nJoe Thwaites, a climate finance researcher with\nWashington-based World Resources Institute, said domestic\npolitics meant it was \"disappointing but not surprising\" that\nthe United States and Australia had indicated they would not\ncontribute now.\nHe also urged some countries whose new pledges were flat or\nup slightly, like Canada and the Netherlands, to give more.\nA report from the U.N. climate science panel showed last\nyear that climate action financing, both from governments and\nbusiness, had so far been inadequate, Thwaites said.\n\"There is a very clear sense that we need to see major\nincreases and particularly for adaptation, where the needs are\nonly going to rise.\"\n\nMORE FOR THE POOREST?\nThe GCF has allocated some $5.2 billion to 111 projects in\n99 countries ranging from green, low-cost housing in Mongolia's\npolluted capital and a rapid-transit bus system in Karachi using\nmethane to restoring climate-threatened ecosystems in Namibia.\nIt expects to have parcelled out the rest of its initial pot\nby the end of 2019, Glemarec said, adding he hoped it would be\nable to grow its project pipeline in future.\nAid agencies praise the fund's push to divide its money\nbetween projects to reduce planet-warming emissions and efforts\nto adapt to climate shifts and rising seas, as adaptation has\nreceived only about a fifth of global climate finance until now.\nGlemarec said that since 2015 nearly 70% of the $1.9 billion\nthe fund had allocated for adaptation was for projects in the\nmost vulnerable poor countries, African nations and small island\nstates, stressing the aim was to maintain or raise that share.\nLiane Schalatek, associate director at the Heinrich B\u00f6ll\nFoundation North America and civil society observer at the GCF,\nsaid it should increasingly work with approved ministries and\nagencies in developing states to reach local communities.\n\"There needs to be a focus on the poorest and most\ndisenfranchised people who are usually not given voice and much\nopportunity to participate in or benefit from decision-making on\nclimate change,\" she said.\n(Reporting by Megan Rowling @meganrowling; editing by Chris\nMichaud.

        "text": "By Zofeen Ebrahim and Elena Berton\nKARACHI/LONDON, Oct 22  (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From\nturning organic waste into fertiliser to sharing farm equipment,\nnew businesses seeking to address social problems in Pakistan\nhave made the South Asian nation one of the best performers in\nthe second global poll on social entrepreneurs.\nPakistan was one of the three countries, along with\nAustralia and the Netherlands, whose overall ranking improved\nthe most since the first Thomson Reuters Foundation experts'\npoll on the best countries for social entrepreneurs in 2016.\nThe country advanced 18 spots to place 14th among the\nworld's 45 biggest economies, seen as a nation where social\nentrepreneurs can make a living and attract good staff.\n\"The landscape has changed tremendously in terms of openness\nand receptivity for entrepreneurship,\" said Shaista Ayesha, 39,\nwho heads product development at SEED Ventures, a business\nincubator based in Karachi.\n\"Almost all universities have business incubation centres\nthat are either working with the public or the private sectors\nto support home-grown enterprises.\"\nInterest of young people in the sector was seen as spurring\ngrowth, with a youth boom giving Pakistan one of the world's\nyoungest populations, a trend seen continuing until at least\n2050, according to the United Nations Development Programme.\nAbout two-thirds of Pakistan's 210 million people are\nyounger than 30 with 29% percent aged between 15 and 29.\nThis new generation of young Pakistanis was not only aware\nof the political and socio-economic challenges faced by the\ncountry, but has also found social networks to voice opinions.\n\"Social issues no longer go unnoticed, and there is a\ngeneral increase in public eagerness, particularly among the\nyouth, to step up and bring positive change,\" Ayesha said.\n\nYOUTH MOVEMENT\nAs the government struggles to find solutions for a nation\naffected by poverty, water scarcity, climate change and lack of\nsanitation, social startups are emerging to fill the gaps.\nPakistani banker and economist Ishrat Hussain, adviser to\nPrime Minister Imran Khan for Institutional Reforms and\nAusterity, said he was not surprised by the poll results.\nHussain cited microfinance institutions, business schools\nand the digital economy for supporting entrepreneurship.\n\"There are higher education institutions that have set up\nentrepreneur centres which are arming people who are not\nformally trained with business tools, especially women, farmers,\nyouth ... people otherwise neglected,\" he added.\nMost social enterprises in Pakistan are headed by young\nentrepreneurs. About one-fifth are led by women compared with 5%\nof mainstream companies, according to British Council research.\nNeelum Hassan, a 26-year-old industrial design graduate,\nfounded her social enterprise, Aerosync, in 2016 to design and\nmanufacture products with a social or environmental impact.\nHer first project is a design for a lightweight,\nsolar-powered mobile cart with foldable counter that converts\ninto a shelter for the thousands of street vendors in Pakistani\ncities.\nStreet and mobile vending lets people set up businesses with\nminimal outlay and no paperwork, but they have increasingly\nfaced crackdown from authorities for not having licences.\nHer plan would provide a ready-made package with registered\ncarts, allocated space and affordable lease schemes.\nHassan won the \"Most Promising Woman-Led Business\" award at\nthe Global Clean tech program set up by the United Nations\nIndustrial Development Organization and the $15,000 prize money\nwent towards developing a small manufacturing line, she said.\n\"I personally won't call this a success story because the\njourney has just begun,\" Hassan said.\nImproved access to local and international investment - with\nPakistan jumping 24 places to 9th place in the latest poll,\nconducted in partnership with Deutsche Bank - has helped many\nyoung social entrepreneurs get their ideas off the ground.\nSupport group Impact Link was launched in December 2018 with\nbacking from the Scottish government to support a small number\nof social enterprises moving beyond the early growth stages.\nIn the latest round of funding, it gave 4,000 pounds\n($4,946) each to five startups to scale up their business.\nThese included TrashIt, which is working on collecting\norganic waste from food vendors and turn it into fertiliser, and\nGood Earth, which is behind sharing platforms for farm\nequipment, often beyond the means of poor farmers.\nSEED Ventures co-founder Faraz Khan said a proposed law to\nprovide a legal definition for social enterprises would also\nhelp attract more foreign investors to Pakistan once approved.\n\"Once under a legal umbrella, they will be able to attract\nglobal impact capital and philanthropic funding,\" said Khan.\nAhad Nazir, head of the Centre for Private Sector Engagement\nat Pakistan's Sustainable Development Policy Institute, said the\nlaw would give certainty to investors and social entrepreneurs.\n\"Some of the companies claiming to be social enterprises are\nnot actually social enterprises, and some companies that are\nactually social enterprises don't know they are,\" he said.\nIshrat Hussain, however, disagreed.\n\"I think it's a bit premature to gag these entrepreneurs\nwith a legal framework. Let them bloom and flourish, and when\nthey reach maturity, then rein them,\" he said. \"You should not\nsuppress their creativity at this stage.\"\n($1 = 0.8086 pounds)\n(Reporting by Zoleen Ebrahim and Elena Berton\n@ElenaBerton; Editing by Belinda Goldsmith\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

In addition, more than two\nmillion have been internally displaced by the ongoing conflict.\nHundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees are being forced\nback, or returning of their own accord and struggling to find\nhousing in the cities where they often settle for jobs, said\nAbdul Baqi Popal, the deputy minister of municipalities.\nThe government has made affordable housing a priority, with\nthe aim of giving 1 million \"Occupancy Certificates\" for\ninformal settlers over the next three years, he said.\n\"The aim is to formalise informal settlements, which are\nlargely on government land. But the government has low financial\nand management capacity to implement the plan, so the pace is\nslow,\" he said on the sidelines of a U.N. urban forum in Penang.\n\"The certificate will give them the right to occupy the plot\nwithout eviction for five years, after which if they meet\ncertain conditions, they can get a land title that gives them\nfull ownership,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nAll certificates will be in the name of both the husband and\nwife - and in the case of widows, the name of the woman, which\nis unusual in Afghanistan, he said.\nFour decades of war have uprooted millions of Afghans from\ntheir homes, and sent them to seek refuge elsewhere in the\ncountry, or in neighbouring Pakistan and Iran.\nAbout 2.4 million displaced Afghans have returned to\nAfghanistan since 2014, according to U.N. estimates.\nReturnees generally experience a deterioration in livelihood\nopportunities and wages after returning to Afghanistan,\naccording to a study published this year by the World Bank and\nthe U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).\nThey also have limited housing options, urban experts said.\nUnder the City For All programme launched in 2016, the\nAfghan government has committed to urban planning and land\nmanagement, including surveying and registering properties in\nurban areas.\nThe government is using mapping tools to collect land data\nand, under a presidential decree issued last year, is\nregistering properties and informal settlements for Occupancy\nCertificates, said Popal, who oversees 165 municipalities.\nMore than 70% of homes in urban areas are informal or\nwithout a title, said Popal, who has previously worked at UNHCR\nand UN-Habitat, the settlements agency.\n\"Giving security of tenure to residents is important for\ntrust building and greater economic stability, because they will\npay taxes, and that will boost government revenue,\" Popal said.\nThe government has a land bank of about 400,000 hectares,\nand plans to allocate some of it to build low-cost housing for\nreturning refugees and migrants from rural areas, he said.\nFunding could come from aid agencies and the private sector.\n\"The country has been in war for four decades - the economy\nis poor, government capacity is limited, our options are few,\"\nhe said.\n\"But with housing and tenure security, people can invest in\ntheir homes, they can make plans, and try to move forward with\ntheir lives,\" he added.\n(Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Michael\nTaylor.

MAYA BAY, THAILAND: The island cove was made famous by\nthe 2000 film \"The Beach\" starring Leonardo DiCaprio. It was\nclosed to tourists last year until 2021 in a bid to salvage the\narea's coral reefs, which have been damaged by warmer\ntemperatures and a flood of tourists.\n\n2. BORACAY ISLAND, THE PHILIPPINES: The resort was closed\nfor a six-month cleanup from April to October 2018 after being\ndescribed as a \"cesspool\" by President Rodrigo Duterte. The\nisland attracted 2 million visitors the previous year but has\nnow limited numbers to 19,000 per day and banned beach parties,\nsmoking and drinking.\n\n3. MOUNT EVEREST BASE CAMP, CHINA: The Chinese government\nclosed its side of the Everest base camp this year to anyone\nwithout a climbing permit due to the huge amounts of rubbish\npiling up at the site, according to the Lonely Planet travel\nwebsite. The Chinese base camp, located in Tibet, was accessible\nby car.\n\n4. FJADRARGLJUFUR CANYON, ICELAND: The popular site, which\nfeatured in one of Justin Bieber's music videos, was closed to\ntourists for about three months this year due to damage from wet\nweather and foot traffic. The number of visitors had nearly\ndoubled after being featured in the pop singer's \"I'll Show You\"\nvideo.\n\n5. THE FAROE ISLANDS, DENAMRK: Ten popular tourists sites\nwere closed temporarily this year for maintenance by an\ninternational team of volunteers after a 10% growth in visitor\nnumbers in recent years.\n\n6. SIPADAN ISLAND, MALAYSIA: One of the world's most\nrenowned scuba diving spots on Malaysia's part of Borneo island\nwill be shut for a month every December from 2020 to allow the\ncoral and marine ecosystem to recuperate.\n\n7. KOMODO ISLAND, INDONESIA: Authorities are due to limit\nvisitor numbers and raise entry prices to the island in order to\nconserve the population of the Komodo dragons, the world's\nlargest living species of lizard. Officials initially planned to\nclose the island for one year from 2020 but later scrapped the\nidea.\n\n8. SPANISH STEPS, ITALY: Rome banned tourists from sitting\non the famous monument in August, in a crackdown on overcrowding\nby tourists. Visitors can still walk up and down, but offenders\nof the sitting ban can be fined up to 400 euros ($444).\nThe site was largely shut between October 2015 and September\n2016 for a private restoration after the 135 steps had become\nloose, stained and cracked under the strain of daily use by both\nresidents and visitors.\n\nSource: Thomson Reuters Foundation, Reuters, New Straits\nTimes, Lonely Planet\n($1 = 0.9001 euros)\n(Writing by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi; Editing by Michael Taylor.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

We have to\nensure equitable distribution of resources,\" said Sharif, a\nformer town planner and mayor of Penang island, off Malaysia's\nwest coast.\nBut increasingly, planners are ignoring the poorest and most\nvulnerable residents including slum dwellers and street vendors,\nsaid Renu Khosla, director of the Centre for Urban & Regional\nExcellence in New Delhi.\n\"Our cities are not being planned for the poor. But when\ncities are planned without people in mind, you get more informal\nsettlements, you get more inequality,\" she told the Thomson\nReuters Foundation.\n\"Perhaps it's time to move away from territorial and\nland-based planning, and plan around people and their needs.\"\nFrom Bangkok to Manila, as Asian cities strive to become\nmore modern, street vendors and hawkers are viewed increasingly\nas a hindrance to city planning and are being evicted from\npavements.\nBut public spaces are for the good of all members of the\npublic and must be legally available to everyone, said\nChidchanok Samantrakul at WIEGO, a global non-profit that helps\ninformal workers.\n\"Half the city is informal - informal settlers, street\nvendors - yet planners only focus on the formal. But there has\nto be opportunity for everyone to co-exist,\" she said.\nSeveral cities in the region are now using Minecraft, a\nvideo game that allows players to build their own worlds using\nvirtual Lego-like pieces, to get communities to participate in\nupgrading their common spaces, under a UN-Habitat programme.\nIn the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi, where women and girls\noften face harassment on the streets and on public transport,\nMinecraft was used to identify safety issues and make public\nspaces safer, said Thu Dao Thi Bao of non-profit Plan\nInternational.\n\"Technology helps give girls and women a voice. We have to\nencourage their participation in city planning and management.\"\n(Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Michael\nTaylor.

It is the address\nof India's most famous monument - the Taj Mahal - on a mapping\napp that aims to help millions of slum dwellers, rural\nresidents, refugees and those in need of emergency aid.\nAs smartphones become a common sight in developing nations\nand mapping technologies get more advanced, apps such as\nWhat3Words, CitoCode and Google's Plus Code are making it\npossible to locate even the world's most remote areas on a map.\nBut it is particularly useful in a country like India, where\nmore than a quarter of the urban population lives in informal\nsettlements which may lack street names and house numbers, said\nGiles Rhys Jones, chief marketing officer at What3Words.\n\"The lack of a formal address can be very limiting - from\ndifficulty in receiving post to being unable to open a bank\naccount or vote,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by\nphone from London.\n\"Having a uniform system is a potentially radical shift, as\nit enables digitisation of databases of addresses, land\nadministration geoportals, and accurate disaster and emergency\nservice responses,\" he said on Friday.\nWhat3Words divides the Earth into 3 metre x 3 metre squares\nand assigns each box a unique three-word address. It is\navailable as a mobile app in 36 languages, including five Indian\nlanguages introduced earlier this year, with plans for more.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross in the\nPhilippines uses the system in disaster zones where buildings\nmay be flattened and roads washed away.\nIn Mongolia, home to a large nomadic population, it is used\nin government documents and is recognised by many banks.\nIn a pilot for postal services in three Indian states last\nyear, What3Words was faster than traditional sorting methods,\nJones said, adding that it would take less than five days to\nprovide everyone in the country a three-word address.\nMore than a billion people live in slums and informal\nsettlements, according to the United Nations, and they are often\ndenied government documentation and benefits because they lack a\nformal address.\n\"Accurate identification of a housing unit enables\ninhabitants to demand, access and pay for services such as\nelectricity and water easily,\" said Vikram Jain, director of\nsocial consultancy FSG in Mumbai.\n\"Rights can be accessed when an individual can be linked to\na property accurately, which allows the individual to use,\ntransfer and inherit rights confidently,\" he said.\nFor slum dwellers in the Indian city of Kolkata,\nDublin-based non-profit Addressing the Unaddressed uses GPS\nnavigation system coordinates to create a 10-character word code\nthat can then be located on Google maps.\n\"It has the potential to help a large number of people\naround the world,\" said Google spokesman Dusan Farrington,\nreferring to Plus Code.\n\"Our goal is that everyone, regardless of who they are or\nwhere they live, can be found on Google maps.\"\n(Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran.

Debt\nbondage is what we are trying to tackle,\" Law said.\nMigrant rights groups welcomed the initiative but warned its\nimplementation could be problematic as countries such as\nIndonesia would only allow workers to go abroad through its\nlocally-approved agencies.\n\"It could be quite chaotic for the sending country because\nthey want to monitor the whereabouts of the workers,\" said Alex\nOng from advocacy group Migrant Care, which campaigns for\nmigrant workers in Malaysia.\nRecruitment agencies are not allowed to charge workers in\nthe formal sectors - such as manufacturing and plantation - fees\nthat are higher one month's salary, under current guidelines set\nby the employers' group, the Malaysian Employers' Federation.\nBut domestic workers are excluded from the clause, and\ntypically have to spend six months with almost all their wages\ndeducted to cover the costs they owe the recruiters for local\ntravel or medical tests, said Ong.\n\"The question is why this protection is not applicable for\ndomestic workers too,\" asked Ong, calling for a legal reform.\nMalaysia is home to an estimated 212,000 of about 40 million\npeople trapped in modern slavery worldwide, according to the\nGlobal Slavery Index by human rights group Walk Free Foundation.\n($1 = 4.1910 ringgit)\n(Reporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi; Editing by Michael Taylor.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

        "text": "By Michelle Nichols\nUNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The fight for justice for victims of Islamic State militants does not end with the death of leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Nobel laureate Nadia Murad said on Wednesday, asking: \"How about those that raped us?\"\nMurad, who won the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, is an Iraqi Yazidi woman who was enslaved and raped by Islamic State (ISIS)fighters in Mosul, Iraq, in 2014. Several of her brothers were killed by Islamic State and their wives also held captive.\nSince 2010, Baghdadi led the jihadist group.

        "text": "* West German did not know lover was unofficial Stasi\ninformant\n* He was arrested in 1986 and initially accused of spying\n* Aims to tell younger generation what Stasi prison was like\n* Germany approaching 30th anniversary of Berlin Wall's fall\nBy Tanja Daube and Michelle Martin\nBERLIN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - When Hans Schulze was imprisoned\nin Communist East Germany back in the 1980s, he never thought\nhe'd ever return once he got out. But now he regularly unlocks\nhis old cell door to show tourists what life was like in a jail\nrun by the Stasi secret police.\nA West German responsible for his chemical company's\nbusiness in the East, Schulze was on his way to a trade fair in\nthe East German city of Leipzig in 1986 when he stopped at a\nmotorway service station and met a woman by chance.\nSchulze, now 66, was fascinated by the well-dressed woman\nand they began a relationship. The East-West dimension of their\nliaison gave Schulze a thrill, but to this day he does not know\nfor sure whether she loved him or was just using him.\n\"I didn't know that she was an unofficial Stasi informant,\"\nsaid Schulze, who gives tours of Hohenschoenhausen prison, where\nhe spent some of his 13 months behind bars three decades ago, in\neastern Berlin.\n\"It was only later, when the accusation of spying was\nraised, that everything appeared in a different light.\"\nSuch themes of temptation, duplicity and betrayal that\nmarked Cold War-era espionage have come back into focus in the\nrun-up to the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall on\nNov. 9 that brought about German reunification.\n\n\"ROMEO SPIES\"\nSchulze found out some time after he became romantically\ninvolved with the woman that her husband - from whom she was\nseparated - worked for the Stasi, but he did not grasp the full\nextent until the media reported on her Stasi files in 2009.\nUnder its foreign intelligence chief Markus Wolf, the Stasi\nperfected the use of \"Romeo spies\" - agents who used their\npersonal charms as well as their wiles to ensnare Western\nsources of valuable intelligence.\nUnbeknown to Schulze, his lover had been tasked by the Stasi\nwith picking up solo travellers and business people from the\nWest. She told him she wanted to flee to the West and Schulze\nstill isn't sure whether that was her personal desire or whether\nthe Stasi wanted her to continue working for them in the West.\nThree years before the fall of the Wall, Schulze was\narrested at the border as he tried to leave the East. A letter\nthe woman had written about her husband's work was found in his\ncar, as was some money she wanted Schulze to take to the West.\nSchulze was accused of spying and a day later his lover was\narrested, though he is not sure what the charge against her was.\nEast German authorities ultimately withdrew accusations of\nspying, subversive human trafficking and betraying state secrets\n- which would have triggered a long prison term - and he was\nultimately sentenced to 2-1/2 years in prison for currency\ncrimes and helping prepare an illegal border crossing.\n\"I can tell you it really hits you hard. You have to absorb\nit first,\" he said of the emotional manipulation. \"And I know\nnow that they did it on purpose - that's what I accuse them of.\"\nSchulze thinks his status as a West German meant he was\nprobably treated better than others at Hohenschoenhausen, where\nphysical violence was widely used in the 1950s before\npsychological interrogation methods took over.\nHe was transferred to another prison before his release in\nOctober 1987. His lover, who had spent her imprisonment working\nin the kitchen at Hohenschoenhausen, was freed a month later.\nThey saw each other in prison but Schulze said their\nrelationship ended around the time they were released, and after\nreunification in 1990 she became a car saleswoman and hotel\ndirector in the West.\nIt was initially hard for Schulze to return to the prison\nfollowingr reunification but he wants to make sure that others -\nincluding children born long after East Germany collapsed - know\nwhat happened behind the prison's walls.\nHe now tells his story to some of the more than 455,000\npeople who visit Hohenschoenhausen every year. Thousands of\npolitical prisoners were incarcerated in the prison, which has\nsince been turned into a museum and memorial.\n\"That period of time still affects me to this day and that's\nwhy I give tours here now, to pass on the message,\" Schulze\nsaid.\n(Additional reporting by Inke Kappeler and Thomas Escritt\nWriting by Michelle Martin\nEditing by Paul Carrel and Mark Heinrich)",

        "text": "By Nellie Peyton\nNEW YORK, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda on\nThursday announced plans for a bill that would impose the death\npenalty on homosexuals, following plans announced by Brunei\nearlier this year to do the same.\nSame-sex relations are illegal in at least 68 countries\naround the world, according to the International Lesbian, Gay,\nBisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA).\nIn addition to Uganda and Brunei, here are eight countries\nthat have recently moved to roll back LGBT+ rights.\n\n1. United States\nThe United States began implementing a ban on transgender\npeople serving in the military this year, after President Donald\nTrump announced the change in 2017.\nTrump cited medical costs as one reason for rolling back a\n2016 policy of his predecessor Barack Obama, which had allowed\ntransgender people to serve openly for the first time and also\nreceive medical care to transition genders.\n\n2. Russia\nRussia fined its first minor last year under a so-called\n\"gay propaganda\" law that has been increasingly used to repress\nthe LGBT+ community.\nThe 2013 law makes illegal any event or act regarded by the\nauthorities as an attempt to promote homosexuality to minors. It\nhas been used to stop gay pride marches and detain gay rights\nactivists.\n\n3. Poland\nPoland's ruling party leader condemned gay pride marches\nthis year and said the rule of law should be used to regulate\nwhat he called a \"travelling theatre\".\nAhead of elections later this month, the conservative Law\nand Justice (PiS) party has used its anti-LGBT+ stance as a key\ncampaign issue, which critics say has fomented violence toward\nthe gay community.\n\n4. Indonesia\nIndonesia has drafted a law that would ban gay sex, which\nparliament delayed voting on last month amid protests.\nThe proposed revisions to the criminal code also include a\nban on sex outside of marriage, a four-year jail term for\nabortions in the absence of a medical emergency or rape and a\nprison term for black magic.\n\n5. Nigeria\nNigeria passed a bill in 2014 that criminalized same-sex\nrelationships with penalties of up to 14 years in prison.\nAuthorities charged 43 people with homosexual acts in one\ncase in 2017, ordering most to undergo monitoring and \"sexual\nrehabilitation.\"\n\n6. Malaysia\nMalaysia's LGBT+ community has faced growing persecution,\nwith two women caned in public for \"attempting lesbian sex\" in\nthe state of Terengganu last year.\nPrime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the leader of a new\ngovernment elected last year, has said the country cannot accept\nsame-sex marriage or LGBT+ rights.\n\n7. Chad\nChad introduced a new penal code in 2017 with light prison\nsentences and fines for same-sex relations which had not been\nexplicitly criminalized before, although there was a law\ncondemning \"acts against nature\", according to the ILGA.\nAn earlier draft of the legislation from 2014 would have\ncriminalized gay sex with up to 20 years in prison.\n\n8. Slovakia\nSlovakia inserted a definition of traditional marriage in\nits constitution in 2014.\nIn 2015 the country held a referendum which would have\nstrengthened its ban on marriage and child adoption by same-sex\ncouples, but it failed to pass on low voter turnout.\n(Writing by Nellie Peyton; Editing by Chris Michaud.

        "text": "By Emma Batha\nLONDON, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - An estimated 10\nto 15 million people are not recognised as nationals by any\ncountry, often depriving them of basic rights most of the world\ntakes for granted such as education, healthcare, housing and\njobs.\nThe U.N. refugee agency is hosting a major intergovernmental\nmeeting in Geneva on Monday to assess progress at the midpoint\nof its #Ibelong campaign which aims to end statelessness by\n2024. Here are examples of stateless populations:\n\nMYANMAR/BANGLADESH: In 1982, Buddhist-majority Myanmar\npassed a citizenship law that effectively rendered stateless\nmost Rohingya, who are Muslim and of South Asian descent.\nEthnic violence has driven many to leave, but hundreds of\nthousands remain in Myanmar. There are about 900,000 Rohingya in\nneighbouring Bangladesh and smaller populations across Asia.\nSome are sold into slavery on fishing boats and plantations.\n\nIVORY COAST: Ivory Coast is home to 692,000 stateless\npeople. Many are descended from migrants from neighbouring\ncountries who were encouraged to work on Ivory Coast's coffee\nand cotton plantations in the 20th century.\nAt least a quarter of Ivory Coast's population is estimated\nto be of foreign descent, and the question of who is or is not\nIvorian helped fuel two civil wars in the West African country.\n\nTHAILAND: Nearly 479,000 people are stateless, including\nmembers of ethnic hill tribes such as the Yao, Hmong and Karen\nwho live in the mountainous border with Myanmar and Laos, and\nthe semi-nomadic \"Sea Gypsies\" along the Andaman coast.\n\nESTONIA/LATVIA: When the Soviet Union broke up, many ethnic\nRussians remained in the new Baltic states and were defined as\n\"non-citizens\".\nNearly 221,000 stateless people live in Latvia and 78,000 in\nEstonia, mainly ethnic Russians who have trouble obtaining\ncitizenship and at times face discrimination.\n\nSYRIA: In 1962, many Kurds in the northeast were stripped of\ncitizenship, a move Human Rights Watch described as part of a\nplan to \"Arabise\" the resource-rich region.\nBefore the civil war, there were an estimated 300,000\nstateless Kurds in Syria, many of whom were promised nationality\nby President Bashar al-Assad in reaction to the 2011 uprising.\nU.N. data suggests the number fell to 160,000, but this may\nbe partly because many fled the war.\nHuman rights experts have warned that babies born to Syrian\nrefugee women in Lebanon and Jordan could end up stateless.\n\nKUWAIT: Stateless people are known as Bidoon, which is short\nfor bidoon jinsiya meaning \"without nationality\" in Arabic. Some\ntrace their origins to nomadic tribes that once moved freely\naround the Gulf region.\nThere are about 92,000 Bidoon in Kuwait, according to U.N.\ndata, but some estimates are much higher. They are often barred\nfrom free education, healthcare and many jobs.\n\nNEPAL: Although Nepal says it does not have a stateless\npopulation, experts on statelessness believe many people,\npossibly hundreds of thousands, may be affected.\nPart of the problem derives from a law banning women married\nto foreigners from passing their nationality to their children.\nThere is also a stateless population of people who were expelled\nby Bhutan in the 1990s.\n\nDOMINICAN REPUBLIC: A 2013 court ruling, along with earlier\nchanges to nationality laws aimed at tackling illegal migration,\nhas left many stateless, mostly people of Haitian descent who\nwere born in Dominican Republic.\nIn 2015, there were about 134,000 stateless people,\naccording to U.N. data, but the figures are being updated.\n\nIRAQ: There are about 47,500 stateless people who include\nBidoon and Faili Kurds, an ethnic group that historically live\nboth sides of the Iraq-Iran border.\nMore than 100,000 Faili Kurds had their nationality revoked\nin 1980 under the Ba'ath regime. Although many have since had\ntheir nationality reinstated, others remain stateless.\n\nEUROPE: Tens of thousands of stateless Roma - an ethnic\ngroup with origins in India - are thought to live in central,\neastern and southern Europe. With the break-up of Czechoslovakia\nand Yugoslavia, successor states claimed they belonged\nelsewhere.\nOther Roma in Kosovo and Bosnia have become stateless due to\nwar-time displacement.\nRoma are often unable to register their children's births or\nhold official property titles. This can make it hard to prove\nwhere they are from.\n\nVENEZUELA: Some children born to Venezuelan parents who have\nfled to other countries amid a political and economic crisis at\nhome are at increased risk of statelessness.\n(Reporting by Emma Batha @emmabatha, Editing by Claire Cozens.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

The move \"symbolises our ability to come\ntogether\" while also boosting tourism and jobs, his office said.\nThe palace opening was cited at an annual gathering of\nsocial entrepreneurs in Addis Ababa as an example of a rising\nnumber of tourism businesses set up with a mission to help local\ncommunities - with warnings these projects came with risks.\n\"(The palace) will add value to our tourism ... it will help\nEthiopia,\" said Samrawit Moges, founder of Travel Ethiopia,\nfirst company in the country to use female guides.\n\"But tourism is a very delicate sector that can change the\ncountry for better or for worse ... we need to give high\nimportance to the environment.\"\nThe growing social enterprise sector is tapping into the\nglobal travel and tourism industry, which contributed a record\n$8.8 trillion and 319 million jobs to the world economy in 2018,\naccording to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC).\nThe WTTC forecast another 100 million new jobs by 2029.\n\nDANGERS OF GROWTH\nMatt Pfahlert, co-founder of the Australian Centre for Rural\nEntrepreneurship, said growing numbers of tourism projects from\nAustralia to Africa were being led by social enterprises -\nbusinesses set up with a mission to help society.\nThere was no official record on the number of such ventures.\nPfahlert led a A$2.5 million ($1.7 million) community\nbuy-back of an old jail in his home town of Beechworth in the\nAustralian state of Victoria, that was famed for its connection\nto the nation's legendary outlaw Ned Kelly.\nIt opened in 2017, creating 22 jobs in a rural area with few\nopportunities and was helping to raise funds to train young\npeople on business development to stem a decline in rural areas.\n\"For us the jail is the engine for a national project,\"\nPfahlert told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at the 12th annual\nSocial Enterprise World Forum (SEWF).\n\"If we get it right we can make a huge difference,\" said\nPfahlert, adding that cycling tours were another draw.\nHe said tourism social enterprises focused on helping\ncommunities, while traditional tourism businesses tended to be\nprofit-oriented with a focus on volume growth.\nIn Ireland, for example, the social enterprise My Streets\ntrains homeless people to run tours of Dublin and Drogheda.\nWhile in India, Grassroutes aims to create \"one million\nlivelihood opportunities\" and reduce rural migration by running\nvarious tourist activities in villages outside Mumbai.\nBut tourism social entrepreneurs said in the rush to do\ngood, it was important to be wary of not growing too fast as\nthis could negatively impact communities and the environment.\nTheodore Nzabonimpa, founder of Beyond The Gorilla\nExperiences in Rwanda, said it had been important to stem the\nnumber of tourists visiting the mountain gorillas in his country\nby doubling national park prices in 2017 before damage occurred.\n\"The risks can be huge even if the intention is good ... you\nhave to take quick action to address any risks,\" said\nNzabonimpa, whose tour company promotes community ecotourism.\n($1 = 1.4650 Australian dollars)\n(Reporting by Belinda Goldsmith @BeeGoldsmith; Editing by\nClaire Cozens.

High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said.\n\"So far 14 states have pledged 6,611 places of\nresettlement...That's all,\" Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR special\nenvoy for the central Mediterranean situation, told a briefing.\nCanada, Norway and Italy are among them, while Niger and\nRwanda have offered others temporary sanctuary, he said.\n\"There are many countries that could offer places of\nresettlement and that do not,\" he added.\nLibya has become the main conduit for Africans fleeing war\nand poverty trying to reach Europe since former leader Muammar\nGaddafi was toppled in 2011, though the number of crossings\ndropped sharply from 2017 amid a European Union-backed push to\nblock arrivals.\nLibya is host to 45,000 registered refugees and\nasylum-seekers, as well as an estimated 650,000 migrants, many\nof whom have found jobs there, Cochetel said.\nMore than 5,000 refugees and migrants are held in 19\nofficial detention facilities, some controlled by armed groups,\nas well as an unknown number in squalid centres run by\ntraffickers, he said. Rights groups say abuses are rife\nincluding beating and forced labour.\nDetainees include those who left on boats for Europe and\nwere brought back by the Libyan Coast Guard, Cochetel said,\nunderlining it is not a safe country of asylum.\n\"And you have desperate individuals who go to detention\ncentres, sometimes they pay to get inside detention centres.\nSometimes they feel better protected in a detention centre than\noutside,\" Cochetel said.\n\"Because some nationalities outside detention centres are\ntargeted by human traffickers, are kidnapped, and then you have\nextortion, you have torture.\n\"Some people don\u2019t feel safe in many urban centres in Libya.\nSo some of them prefer to be detained, even if conditions are\nnot good in those detention centres. Others try to bribe their\nway to get inside the detention centre in the hope that UNHCR\nwill resettle them,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay)",

But food is not\nbeing produced where it is most needed. Countries are failing to\nprovide incentives to farmers to produce more nutritious food.\n\"Countries keep subsidising products with low nutritional\nvalue, favouring staple foods \u2014 wheat, rice, maize \u2014 over\nfruits and vegetables. This has a negative effect on nutrition\nand dietary diversity.\n\"If we want to envision a world free of hunger and\nmalnutrition, production incentives have to change.\n\"We need better incentives for the world's agricultural\nproducers. Better information to prod consumers into choosing\nhealthier diets. Sustainable trade with clear rules. And a big\npush to think of nutrition as part of food safety.\"\nJESSICA FANZO, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, JOHN HOPKINS UNIVERSITY\nAND CO-CHAIR, GLOBAL NUTRITION REPORT\n\"One thing that would be a game-changer for food systems is\nfor countries to develop holistic food system policies with\nclear, near and long-term, time-bound actions and goals to be\nachieved for human and planetary health.\n\"There are agriculture, climate change and nutrition\nnational policies, but very few that bring it all together.\"\nBABA DIOUM, JOINT WINNER OF 2019 AFRICA FOOD PRIZE AND\nAGRICULTURAL ENTREPRENEUR, SENEGAL\n\"To respond to such concerns, it is imperative to move\ntowards a new agricultural policy capable of preserving the\nproductive bases of soil, water and biodiversity in order to\nestablish durability.\n\"Such a policy, through innovative technologies and\nincentives, enables farmers to produce and market enough\nagri-food products with high nutritional value that meet\nsanitary and phytosanitary standards for the protection of\nconsumers.\"\nMAHESH BADAL, LIVELIHOOD AND NATURAL RESOURCE COORDINATOR,\nACTIONAID NEPAL\n\"There can be no end to rising world hunger without\nempowering women farmers and restoring the rights of rural\ncommunities.\n\"Women make up at least half of the smallholders, marginal\nfarmers, pastoralists, fisher folk, forest dwellers, tribal and\nindigenous peoples who produce 80% of the world's food. But they\nare being denied access to land and natural resources.\"\nAGNES KALIBATA, PRESIDENT, ALLIANCE FOR A GREEN REVOLUTION\nIN AFRICA (AGRA), FORMER MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND ANIMAL\nRESOURCES IN RWANDA\n\"Food systems are often designed with an end in mind; be it\nfood security, better incomes, better livelihoods, or pure\nprofit motive.\n\"What we need is to refine the end, ensuring healthy,\naffordable and accessible diets for all. This is critical for\nbuilding household resilience.\n\"As food systems are complicated with no silver bullets,\ncreating the right policy environment should be prioritised.\nThis will enable farmers to diversify into more nutritious foods\nand embrace nature-based solutions.\n\"It will also create incentives for private-sector\ninvolvement in food systems.\u201d\nBRUCE CAMPBELL, DIRECTOR, THE CGIAR RESEARCH PROGRAM ON\nCLIMATE CHANGE, AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SECURITY (CCAFS)\n\"In low-income countries, the governments need to provide an\nenabling framework to facilitate orders of magnitude more\ninvestment by the private sector in fostering local and national\nfood value chains to both meet needs of rising urban populations\nand changing diets, as well as to tap into smallholder farming\noperations.\n\"The unacceptable alternative is a massive increase in food\nimports.\"\n(Reporting By Thin Lei Win @thinink, Editing by Chris Michaud.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, climate\nchange, women's and LGBT+ rights, human trafficking, and\nproperty rights.

With more local training and online sales,\nshe thinks Senegal's nascent clothing industry can grow.\n\"We have so much talent, but I think we just need a little\nbit more structure to take it to the next level,\" said Diouf in\nan interview in the Senegalese capital, Dakar.\n\"For me, the Beyonce storyline is opening the conversation\nand opening doors.\"\nDiouf started her brand in 2016 after going back and forth\nbetween Dakar and Paris and realising that her friends in France\nwere eager to buy the clothes she had made in Senegal.\nDakar is known for its vibrant fashion scene but most\ntailors are self-taught, work on street corners and have no way\nto reach a wider customer base.\nAfter Tongoro was featured in Elle and Vogue magazines,\nDiouf recognised its potential to sell worldwide. She plans to\nscale up next year and eventually open a production facility\nwith 100 to 150 tailors.\n\"I feel like, for so long, everything that comes from Africa\nhas been associated with bad quality,\" she said.\n\"It was important for me to push that narrative forward, to\nsay, you can actually buy something from Africa that is not\ncliche ... but something that can be modern and youthful.\"\nThe challenges are big. Senegalese tailors are not used to\nproducing en masse, and selling clothes online is a relatively\nnew idea for locals, said Diouf.\nIf more African businesses embraced e-commerce it could be a\ngame-changer for expanding their reach, she said.\n\"In Dakar there are more and more emerging brands,\" said\nDiouf. \"I think with the new generation, especially because\nwe're more keen on digital, things are slowly changing.\"\nHer biggest markets are currently Nigeria, South Africa and\nGhana but she hopes to lower prices as the company grows and\nbecome an African version of Zara, the giant Spanish chain.\n\"To scale, I will have to invest in training. I think this\nis the next challenge for 'Made in Africa',\" she said.\n\"We have a lot of artisans with great skills and talent, but\nwhen it comes to scale we cannot afford to have one item not\nlooking alike.\"\nOther West African designers have recognised the same need.\nSophie Sy, who recently launched the Senegalese brand BAAX,\nplans to open a tailoring school in Dakar next year.\nDiouf said she hopes the attention on her brand will lead to\nmore respect for and investment in other African businesses too.\n\"It's very important for me to create an ecosystem where\neveryone can benefit from what I do,\" she said.\n($1 = 0.9072 euros)\n(Reporting by Nellie Peyton; Editing by Katy Migiro.

        "text": "By Emma Batha\nLONDON, Oct 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When a\nchildren's hospital in Aleppo was decimated in 2016 after\nmultiple bombings, British-Syrian doctor Rola Hallam decided to\nturn her grief into action.\nWithin weeks the London consultant anaesthetist was on the\nway to the Syrian border with enough equipment to build the\nworld's first crowdfunded hospital.\n\"Thousands of people from around the world came together to\nraise the money we needed,\" said Hallam, who won the Women of\nthe Year lifetime achievement award in London on Monday.\n\"The Syrian doctors and nurses were blown away. For the\nfirst time they felt heard and seen by people around the world.\nIt gave them so much hope that they named it Hope Hospital.\"\nThe hospital, which has since treated 200,000 children, is\nsupported by CanDo, a social enterprise Hallam set up to help\nlocal humanitarians in warzones crowdfund lifesaving work that\nlarger aid organisations often cannot do.\n\"In Syria, I've really seen the absolute worst of humanity,\nbut I've also seen the very best,\" Hallam told the Thomson\nReuters Foundation at the award ceremony.\n\"The remarkable doctors and nurses that I've had the honour\nand privilege to work with inspire me and motivate me every\nsingle day.\"\nHallam, 40, who moved to Britain as a teenager after growing\nup in Damascus, said the idea for CanDo was born in 2013 when\nshe was working in a Syrian field hospital in rural Aleppo.\nShe was among medics who treated children for horrific burns\nafter a schoolyard was bombed.\nIt was a heartbreaking day made even worse because Hallam\ndid not have all the equipment, medicines and resources she\nneeded to help the children.\n\"I should have been able to give them sedation and pain\nkillers, put a breathing tube in ... Instead, I had to send them\nsuffocating and in pain to Turkey,\" she said.\n\n\"BEYOND BURNT-OUT\"\nAlthough Syrian non-governmental organisations carry out 75%\nof humanitarian work they receive less than 1% of aid funds for\nthe country, Hallam said, a pattern also seen in other warzones.\nAt the same time Hallam said there is growing public\ndisillusionment with some bigger charities, with many people\nwanting to know exactly how and where their donations go.\nNot only are local humanitarians first on the scene, but\nthey can reach communities cut off from other aid and remain\nafter other agencies have pulled out. They also share the same\nculture and language as the people they are helping.\nHallam said CanDo had raised 1.3 million pounds ($1.6\nmillion) since 2017 for projects that have helped 500,000\npeople. It wants to expand to Yemen, South Sudan and Myanmar.\nIn Syria, Hallam would like to see mental health support and\nrest breaks for the \"heroes\" on the frontline.\n\"International aid workers get rest and recuperation. Local\naid workers do not get any of that. They are beyond burnt-out.\nImagine, eight years of this hell,\" she said.\nHallam said attacks on Syria's health services were used as\na weapon of war and were \"crimes against humanity\".\nShe said there had been more than 500 attacks on hospitals,\n90% by Syrian forces and their allies, and more than 800 of her\ncolleagues had been killed, many under torture.\n\"This is premeditated destruction ... in order to terrorise\na civilian population into submission,\" she said.\nBut she warned that the destruction of Syria's health\ninfrastructure also had global repercussions - fuelling the\nrefugee crisis and raising the risks that Syria will be the\nsource of the next Ebola-scale health emergency.\n\"If we don't rebuild Syria's healthcare system we are going\nto be the next exporter of these global diseases,\" she said.\n(1 = 0.7960 pounds)\n(Reporting by Emma Batha @emmabatha; Editing by Belinda\nGoldsmith\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

Police took them to the Immigration Office\nin the city of Antwerp. All were in good health, police said.\nA spokeswoman for the federal police said the prosecutor's\noffice in Antwerp had opened an investigation into the incident,\nwhich occurred on motorway E34 near the town of Turnhout.\nThe investigation is to determine the planned route of the\ntruck, how the migrants climbed on board and if they were trying\nto reach Britain.\nLast week, 39 migrants were found dead in a refrigerated\ntruck in Britain after crossing from the Belgian port of\nZeebrugge. Belgian authorities, facing increasing scrutiny of\ntheir fight against human trafficking, are cooperating with a\nBritish investigation.\nMigrants sometimes choose refrigerated trucks to cross\nborders because their construction makes it more difficult for\ndogs and heat scanners at checkpoints to detect stowaways.\nBelgian paper De Morgen reported that in the Turnhout\nincident, the truck driver and his co-driver were Polish and\ncalled the police after noticing on Wednesday morning that the\nseal on the trailer was broken.\n(Reporting by Marine Strauss; Editing by Janet Lawrence and\nMark Potter)",

        "text": "BANGKOK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - A Thai court of appeal has\nincreased prison time for a former army general and more than\nfifty others convicted in the country's largest human\ntrafficking trial.\nThe case, which involved 103 defendants, began in 2015 after\na crackdown following the gruesome discovery of dozens of\nshallow graves in jungle camps near the Thai-Malaysian border.\nTraffickers had been using the camps to hold mostly Rohingya\nMuslim migrants hostage until their relatives were able to pay\nfor their release, authorities said.\nIn 2017, a criminal court sentenced 62 defendants on 13\ndifferent charges, including trafficking in persons, smuggling\nillegal migrants into the country and organised crime.\nThe appeals court late on Thursday dismissed convictions for\ntwo defendants while increasing the jail terms for 55 others\nwith additional charges of smuggling illegal migrants. Some of\nthese were also given additional prison time for multiple human\ntrafficking charges.\nThose receiving longer sentences include former army\nLieutenant General Manas Kongpan, who saw his 27-year prison\nterm for trafficking and corruption increased to 82 years.\nBanjong Pongphol, an ex-mayor of Padang Besar in Songkhla\nprovince, saw his prison sentence increased to 79 years from 78.\nThe court also upheld the harshest sentence of 94 years for\nSoe Naing, a Rohingya man who the authorities said is a key\nfigure behind the trafficking network. He was found guilty of\nassault causing death and human trafficking.\nThe state prosecutor or the defendants can still lodge an\nappeal against the verdict within 30 days. A further appeal\nwould push the case to the Supreme Court, the final court in the\nThai justice system.\nMyanmar regards Rohingya as illegal migrants from the Indian\nsubcontinent and has confined tens of thousands to sprawling\ncamps in Rakhine state since violence swept the area in 2012.\nThe unrest prompted tens of thousands of Rohingya to flee\nMyanmar by sea. This exodus by boat peaked in 2015, when an\nestimated 25,000 people crossed the Andaman Sea for Thailand,\nMalaysia and Indonesia, many drowning as unsafe and overloaded\nboats capsized.\nWhen violence broke out again in Rakhine state in 2017, more\nthan 700,000 Rohingya crossed into Bangladesh fleeing an army\ncrackdown, according to U.N. agencies.\n(Reporting by Panu Wongcha-um and Panarat Thepgumpanat; Editing\nby Tom Hogue)",

        "text": "By Nanchanok Wongsamuth\nBANGKOK, Oct 31 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Thai chef\nSurasit Buttama spent almost a decade cooking international food\nat upscale restaurants and hotels in the United States and\nThailand, but he found his passion a few months ago at a Bangkok\nrestaurant serving edible insects.\nHis latest recipe consists of almond cream pear tart served\nwith silk worm vanilla icecream. While the icecream has two silk\nworms lying on top, you wouldn't realise that the icecream\nitself is made of powdered silk worms.\nThe same goes with pasta made of crickets and giant water\nbeetles or crickets mixed into brownies. A dish consisting of\ngrilled seabass is served with crispy ants and ant eggs mixed\nwith beurre blanc sauce.\n\"One of the challenges that I enjoy is how to make people\nnot feel scared of the food,\" Buttama told the Thomson Reuters\nFoundation at Insects in the Backyard, Thailand's first edible\ninsect fine dining restaurant, where he is chef de cuisine.\n\"I don't think I'll ever get bored (with cooking insects),\nwhich is something I won't be able to learn anywhere else.\"\nNutritionists and scientists have been touting insects as\nsustainable and cheap source of protein to feed a growing world\nbecause they are high in protein, vitamins, fibre and minerals.\nInsects emit fewer greenhouse gases and less ammonia than\ncattle or pigs and require significantly less land and water\nthan cattle, according to the United Nations' Food and\nAgriculture Organization.\nWhile eating insects is already part of a normal diet for\nThai people in rural areas, 35-year-old Buttama says it is often\nlooked down upon.\nThais account of only 20% of the restaurant's customers.\n\"Thais associate eating insects with poor people, which is a\nmisunderstanding. (People who live in rural areas) are actually\nlucky to have different sources of food,\" he said.\n\"The taste (of insects) is unique and tasty, similar to crab\nand shrimp. For instance, giant water beetles taste like crab,\nwhile grasshoppers taste like shrimp.\"\nButtama joined Insects in the Backyard about six months ago,\nwhich was founded by Somchai Songwattana, chief executive of\nFlynow, one of Thailand's pioneering fashion brands.\n\"What we are trying to do is to let Thais know that insects\nare edible and have value, but they are often overlooked,\" said\nButtama.\nThe chef is often seen hanging around in the dining room\ntalking to customers and recommending dishes - his favourite is\nnachos with cherry tomato salsa, dukkha sour cream, grand padano\ncheese and your choice of organic insects.\nHe also likes to give tips to customers on how to cook their\nown meals at home, and plans to write a book on insect cuisine.\nEdible insects are slowly gaining popularity in Thailand,\nwith packaged snacks sold in 7-Eleven convenience stores and\ninsects sold in bulk at Makro, a local wholesale supermarket.\n\"I like to encourage people to cook their own dishes because\nit helps farmers and it's doing good for the world,\" said\nButtama. \"In the future, it might even be common for us to see\nchefs cooking insects in restaurants.\"\n(Reporting by Nanchanok Wongsamuth @nanchanokw; Editing by Katy\nMigiro.

MAYA BAY, THAILAND: The island cove was made famous by\nthe 2000 film \"The Beach\" starring Leonardo DiCaprio. It was\nclosed to tourists last year until 2021 in a bid to salvage the\narea's coral reefs, which have been damaged by warmer\ntemperatures and a flood of tourists.\n\n2. BORACAY ISLAND, THE PHILIPPINES: The resort was closed\nfor a six-month cleanup from April to October 2018 after being\ndescribed as a \"cesspool\" by President Rodrigo Duterte. The\nisland attracted 2 million visitors the previous year but has\nnow limited numbers to 19,000 per day and banned beach parties,\nsmoking and drinking.\n\n3. MOUNT EVEREST BASE CAMP, CHINA: The Chinese government\nclosed its side of the Everest base camp this year to anyone\nwithout a climbing permit due to the huge amounts of rubbish\npiling up at the site, according to the Lonely Planet travel\nwebsite. The Chinese base camp, located in Tibet, was accessible\nby car.\n\n4. FJADRARGLJUFUR CANYON, ICELAND: The popular site, which\nfeatured in one of Justin Bieber's music videos, was closed to\ntourists for about three months this year due to damage from wet\nweather and foot traffic. The number of visitors had nearly\ndoubled after being featured in the pop singer's \"I'll Show You\"\nvideo.\n\n5. THE FAROE ISLANDS, DENAMRK: Ten popular tourists sites\nwere closed temporarily this year for maintenance by an\ninternational team of volunteers after a 10% growth in visitor\nnumbers in recent years.\n\n6. SIPADAN ISLAND, MALAYSIA: One of the world's most\nrenowned scuba diving spots on Malaysia's part of Borneo island\nwill be shut for a month every December from 2020 to allow the\ncoral and marine ecosystem to recuperate.\n\n7. KOMODO ISLAND, INDONESIA: Authorities are due to limit\nvisitor numbers and raise entry prices to the island in order to\nconserve the population of the Komodo dragons, the world's\nlargest living species of lizard. Officials initially planned to\nclose the island for one year from 2020 but later scrapped the\nidea.\n\n8. SPANISH STEPS, ITALY: Rome banned tourists from sitting\non the famous monument in August, in a crackdown on overcrowding\nby tourists. Visitors can still walk up and down, but offenders\nof the sitting ban can be fined up to 400 euros ($444).\nThe site was largely shut between October 2015 and September\n2016 for a private restoration after the 135 steps had become\nloose, stained and cracked under the strain of daily use by both\nresidents and visitors.\n\nSource: Thomson Reuters Foundation, Reuters, New Straits\nTimes, Lonely Planet\n($1 = 0.9001 euros)\n(Writing by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi; Editing by Michael Taylor.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

        "text": "By Nanchanok Wongsamuth\nBANGKOK, Oct 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When Nanticha\n\"Lynn\" Ocharoenchai organised Thailand's first climate strike in\nMarch, more than half of the 50 people who showed up at the\nrally in Bangkok were students at international schools and\nexpatriates.\nThe same day, Ralyn \"Lilly\" Satidtanasarn, then aged 11, and\na group of fellow pupils submitted an open letter to the prime\nminister, calling for urgent action on climate change.\n\"The fact that Lilly and I can do this draws a lot from\nbeing in international schools,\" said 21-year-old Lynn.\nThere they received classes on the environment, whereas most\nThai state schools do not teach the subject, Lynn noted in an\ninterview a week after graduating from Chulalongkorn University.\nThe young pair are often said to be Thailand's version of\nGreta Thunberg, the teenage Swedish activist who has inspired\nother children worldwide to skip school and demonstrate in the\nstreets about the need to halt global warming and its impacts.\nLynn's mission is to boost awareness among the Thai public\nabout climate change in a country that is witnessing warmer\ntemperatures, sea-level rise, floods and droughts.\nIts capital Bangkok, built on the flood-plains of the Chao\nPhraya River, is expected to be among the urban areas hit\nhardest as the climate heats up.\nNearly 40% of Bangkok may be inundated each year as soon as\n2030 due to more extreme rainfall, according to the World Bank.\nBut while many Thais are directly experiencing the growing\neffects of climate change, Lynn said some Asian social norms\nmade it hard for her to achieve her aims.\n\"In Asia, we have a culture of seniority, and young people\naren't supposed to speak up for themselves and are not supposed\nto speak against adults,\" she told the Thomson Reuters\nFoundation in a Bangkok coffee shop.\n\nLOCAL LINK LACKING\nLynn's interest in climate change was sparked through\nwriting articles on the environment as a journalism intern.\nIn March, she read about Thunberg, which prompted her to\ncreate a Facebook event for a climate strike in Bangkok.\n\"I could truly relate to her frustration and depression, and\njust feelings of hopelessness,\" said Lynn.\n\"For years I cried in my bedroom, and I'm sad and I'm just\nlike, no one's going to do anything about it. But I figured if\nGreta can do it... I can probably do something too,\" she said.\nSince she set up the Facebook page \"Climate Strike\nThailand\", it has attracted almost 5,000 followers.\n\"Initially I had no idea about Thai social media and how to\ndeal with Thai culture and Thai people and changing their\nmindset, but since March I've learned so much,\" she said.\nTara Buakamsri, Thailand director for Greenpeace Southeast\nAsia, said young people in provinces outside Bangkok have long\ncampaigned on environmental issues affecting their home towns,\nsuch as opposing gold mines or coal-power plants.\nBut there has been no networking platform to link them with\ngroups in the capital, and Climate Strike Thailand has yet to\nspread beyond middle-class and international school students, he\nadded.\n\"While the recent climate strikes are connected to climate\nchange issues (at) the international level, they have yet to\nconnect on the local level,\" said Buakamsri.\n\n'JUST THE BEGINNING'\nSince the first March strike, Lynn has led two more in May\nand September.\nFor the third, about 200 young people marched to the\nMinistry of Natural Resources and Environment, demanding that\nthe government declare a climate emergency and shift to 100%\nrenewable energy by 2040.\nIn 2015, Thailand signed the Paris climate agreement and\npledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20-25% by\n2030, compared with 2005 levels.\nBut new coal-fired power plants have since been promoted\nboth in Thailand and neighbouring countries, which activists say\ncontradicts climate change goals.\n\"These climate strikes are by no means methods to solve the\nproblem,\" Lynn said. \"It's just the beginning where you\nacknowledge the problem.\"\nLilly, meanwhile, now 12, has been meeting with business and\nthe government, urging them to care more about the environment.\nHer persistence over the last two years has paid off, and\nshe is widely credited for a pledge by more than 40 national\nretailers to ban plastic bags by next year.\n\"I see no progress made by the government,\" she told\njournalists recently. \"I only see progress made by Lynn and me.\"\n(Reporting by Nanchanok Wongsamuth @nanchanokw; editing by\nMegan Rowling.

They should be a part of urban planning,\"\nSutanudjaja told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nResidents, many of whom have lived there for generations,\nhave valuable knowledge of disaster preparedness, flood\nmitigation and other risks linked to climate change, she said.\n\"Kampungs are living spaces with problems with sanitation\nand housing that reduce their resilience, so we also don't want\nto romanticise them. But demolition is not an answer,\" she said.\nThere is also risk attached to success: George Town on\nPenang island, off Malaysia's west coast, is a UNESCO world\nheritage site that is hugely popular with tourists that many\nresidents blame for congestion and higher rents.\nUnder-pressure cities need a conservation approach when\nmodernising, which includes residents to keeps alive traditional\nknowledge and cultures such as foods, clothing and music, said\nSaswat Bandyopadhyay, an urban planning professor at CEPT\nUniversity in Ahmedabad, India.\n\"The loss of heritage is irreversible - once it's gone, it's\ngone. So we must be doing everything we can to preserve it.\"\n(Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Michael\nTaylor.

Last year the criminal court sentenced three men to up to\n309 years each for trafficking children for prostitution.\nIn both cases, courts capped the imprisonment period at 50\nyears in accordance with Thai law.\nPapop Siamhan, an independent lawyer with expertise in human\ntrafficking, said child prostitution cases resulted in long\nprison sentences because they often involved several laws and\nmany children.\n\"Long prison sentences will act as a deterrent because\npeople will be afraid to commit such crimes, and it will also\nresult in authorities and judges being more careful when\nhandling such cases,\" he said.\nEarlier this year the United States praised Thailand for\nsentencing convicted traffickers and complicit officials to\nsignificant prison terms in its annual Trafficking in Persons\n(TIP) report.\nThailand was ranked as a Tier 2 country in the report,\nmeaning it is making significant efforts to combat the crime.\nSince January this year, courts have handed down 170 prison\nsentences in trafficking cases of which 74 were sentences of\nmore than 10 years, according to the Court of Justice.\nArchana Kotecha, Asia region director and head of legal at\nanti-slavery charity Liberty Shared, said long sentences can be\neffective deterrents when they are addressed at kingpins in\ntrafficking cases and not low level offenders.\nBut she said this must be accompanied by seizure of assets\nwhich should be used to pay compensation to victims.\n\"Deterrence aimed at the freedom and assets of offenders is\nlikely more effective and holistic as it takes into account the\nneed to compensate victims for what they have endured and\nremoves the commercial gain made by the offender,\" she said.\n($1 = 30.3100 baht)\n(Reporting by Nanchanok Wongsamuth, Guilbert, Editing by\nBelinda Goldsmith.

We have to\nensure equitable distribution of resources,\" said Sharif, a\nformer town planner and mayor of Penang island, off Malaysia's\nwest coast.\nBut increasingly, planners are ignoring the poorest and most\nvulnerable residents including slum dwellers and street vendors,\nsaid Renu Khosla, director of the Centre for Urban & Regional\nExcellence in New Delhi.\n\"Our cities are not being planned for the poor. But when\ncities are planned without people in mind, you get more informal\nsettlements, you get more inequality,\" she told the Thomson\nReuters Foundation.\n\"Perhaps it's time to move away from territorial and\nland-based planning, and plan around people and their needs.\"\nFrom Bangkok to Manila, as Asian cities strive to become\nmore modern, street vendors and hawkers are viewed increasingly\nas a hindrance to city planning and are being evicted from\npavements.\nBut public spaces are for the good of all members of the\npublic and must be legally available to everyone, said\nChidchanok Samantrakul at WIEGO, a global non-profit that helps\ninformal workers.\n\"Half the city is informal - informal settlers, street\nvendors - yet planners only focus on the formal. But there has\nto be opportunity for everyone to co-exist,\" she said.\nSeveral cities in the region are now using Minecraft, a\nvideo game that allows players to build their own worlds using\nvirtual Lego-like pieces, to get communities to participate in\nupgrading their common spaces, under a UN-Habitat programme.\nIn the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi, where women and girls\noften face harassment on the streets and on public transport,\nMinecraft was used to identify safety issues and make public\nspaces safer, said Thu Dao Thi Bao of non-profit Plan\nInternational.\n\"Technology helps give girls and women a voice.

        "text": "By Nanchanok Wongsamuth\nBANGKOK, Oct 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Human\ntraffickers in Thailand have ignored court orders to compensate\nvictims in more than 99% of cases in recent years, fuelling\nfears that many survivors could be re-trafficked, data obtained\nexclusively by the Thomson Reuters Foundation revealed.\nThai courts have ordered traffickers to pay their victims\nmore than 130 million baht ($4.3 million) for damages caused in\nabout 1,335 cases since 2014, according to the latest available\nstatistics from the Office of the Attorney General.\nBut the money was only paid in five cases, with survivors\nreceiving a total of 5.6 million baht - excluding cases settled\nout of court - found data from the government's anti-trafficking\ndepartment, obtained via Thailand's freedom of information law.\nAlthough Thailand has rescued a record-breaking 1,000-plus\ntrafficking victims this year, campaigners are concerned that\nthe failure to pay compensation will leave them in fresh danger.\n\"It's an important issue that is unfortunately being\nneglected,\" said Chonticha Tangworamongkon, a program director\nat the Human Rights and Development Foundation, which provides\nfree legal aid to migrant workers and trafficking victims.\n\"This money will enable (victims) to start a new life and\nprevent them from being re-trafficked, but the government's role\nin assisting victims in pursuing the claims is still not clear.\"\nThailand is considering amending its 1999 anti-money\nlaundering law to allow offenders' assets seized by the\nAnti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO) to be used to compensate\nvictims.\nFour public hearings were held this year to discuss the\nlegal amendment - seized assets are currently state property -\nbut it is unclear when it will be reviewed by the cabinet.\nThailand is home to about 610,000 modern slaves - about one\nin 113 of its 69 million people - according to the Global\nSlavery Index by the rights group Walk Free Foundation.\nThe United States called on Thailand in June to increase\ncompensation to victims in its annual Trafficking in Persons\n(TIP) report - which ranked it as a Tier 2 country - meaning it\nis making significant efforts to combat the crime.\nTrafficking victims are automatically compensated through a\ngovernment fund - which provides living and rehabilitation\nexpenses and lost wages - but Tangworamongkon said these sums of\nmoney were not sufficient for victims to rebuild their lives.\nWhile Thai law allows victims to claim compensation from\nconvicted traffickers, offenders have refused to pay in more\nthan 1,000 cases - for which there is no legal punishment.\nThe law requires the Ministry of Social Development and\nHuman Security to assist victims in enforcing their compensation\nclaims, yet anti-trafficking charities and campaigners say it\nhas failed to ensure that fines are collected from offenders.\nBut pursuing claims is a complex process, which involves\ntracing offenders' assets and bringing in the Legal Execution\nDepartment - which enforces court orders - to seize them.\nRatchapon Maneelek, a director at Thailand's\nanti-trafficking department, which falls under the social\nministry, said several government agencies had been holding\nmeetings to determine the extent of their legal powers to\nenforce claims.\n\"This is something new for us that we may not have\nexpertise in,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\nNO MONEY, NO PAY\nAged nine, Bo Soe's mother took him from Myanmar to Thailand\nin 2013, where he was forced by a trafficker to sell roses.\nFor five years, Bo Soe and about 10 other children were\nforced to tout to tourists in a backpacker district in Bangkok\nfrom 6 p.m. to 5 a.m. without pay, eating only one meal a day.\n\"It was very horrible and I was scared. Whenever I couldn't\nsell all (the roses), I would be beaten,\" the 15-year-old told\nthe Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Thailand's western\nregion of Mae Sot, where he lives with his grandmother and aunt.\nIn May, judges upheld a lower court ruling convicting a man\nand woman of trafficking, jailing them for 12 years. They were\nthen ordered to pay 1.26 million baht in compensation to Bo Soe.\n\"I don't know whether or not I will receive the money ...\nbut I'm happy to be back with my family,\" said Bo Soe, whose\nname has been changed to protect his identity as a minor.\nPapop Siamhan, a lawyer who has followed the case, said Bo\nSoe was unlikely to ever receive the money, since the\ntraffickers could not afford the compensation, and the long\nprison sentence meant they would not be able to gather the cash.\nLawyers and charities, which are often hired by trafficking\nvictims to trace offenders' assets and enforce compensation\norders, say seizures by AMLO can actually thwart survivors'\nefforts to obtain restitution.\n\"If it's a case involving the fishing sector, for instance,\nAMLO will seize the vessels and freeze the bank accounts of\noffenders,\" said Siamhan. \"(This) means the victims' lawyer will\nhave to track down other assets.\"\n\n\"OUR LIVES ARE CHEAP\"\nSugunya Rattananakintr, a public prosecutor who focuses on\nhuman trafficking cases, said court rules should be amended to\nrequire offenders who were ordered to pay compensation to do so\nbefore they were allowed to appeal their sentences and fines.\n\"The problem is the enforcement of compensation orders since\nthe ministry doesn't have knowledge in this area,\" she said.\n\"If you wait until the case reaches the highest court, the\noffenders will transfer all their assets, leaving them with\nnothing left to pay (in compensation to victims).\"\nManeelek from the anti-trafficking division said the\nMinistry of Social Development and Human Security and other\nrelated government agencies signed an agreement last year to\nhelp victims with their cases and track down offenders' assets.\n\"We are in the process of looking for ways to cooperate\n(within government), which might take some time,\" he said.\nHowever, time is not a luxury that many victims can afford.\nHaving been trafficked at 22 and forced to work on a fishing\nboat for three years without pay, Aung Aung was hopeful when the\nsix traffickers were jailed for 10 years in July and ordered to\npay about 2 million baht in compensation to their victims.\nBut Aung Aung does not know when he will receive the 65,000\nbaht he was awarded - if at all - and is looking for work at sea\nagain in southern Thailand despite knowing the risks involved.\n\"It was like hell, working so hard ... for more than three\nyears. Our lives are so cheap on the boat,\" he said.\n\"I hope I will get the compensation money some day.\"\n($1 = 30.3800 baht)\n(Reporting by Nanchanok Wongsamuth @nanchanokw; Editing by\nKieran Guilbert and Katy Migiro.

        "text": "(Repeats for clients in Asia.)\nBy Tom Allard\nBANGKOK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - He is Asia\u2019s most-wanted man. He\nis protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private\njet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night\nat a Macau casino.\nTse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected\nof leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate\nformed out of an alliance of five of Asia\u2019s triad groups,\naccording to law enforcement officials. Its members call it\nsimply \u201cThe Company.\u201d Police, in a nod to one of Tse\u2019s\nnicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for \u201cBrother Number\nThree.\u201d\nThe syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of\nmethamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen\ncountries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South\nPacific. But meth \u2013 a highly addictive drug with devastating\nphysical and mental effects on long-term users \u2013 is its main\nbusiness, they say.\nIn what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations\nOffice on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s\nmeth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be\nas high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the\ncartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a\n40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has\nexpanded at least fourfold in the past five years.\nThis unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an\nunprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the\nprime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously\nunreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the\nAustralian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about\n20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far\nthe biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug\ntrafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in\nthe investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar,\nChina, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan,\nwhile not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the\ninvestigation.\nA document containing AFP profiles of the operation\u2019s top 19\nsyndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the\nleader of the syndicate. According to the document, the\norganization has \u201cbeen connected with or directly involved in at\nleast 13 cases\u201d of drug trafficking since January 2015. The\ndocument does not provide specific details of the cases.\nA Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the\n\u201cMultinational CEO\u201d of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement\nAdministration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional\ngovernment agencies says Tse is \u201cbelieved to be\u201d the leader of\nthe Sam Gor syndicate.\nPolice have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected\nboss of the trafficking group.\nSome investigators say that the scope of the syndicate\u2019s\noperation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin\nAmerica\u2019s most legendary narco-traffickers. \u201cTse Chi Lop is in\nthe league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,\u201d said Jeremy\nDouglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC.\n\u201cThe word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no\ndoubt it applies here.\u201d\nReuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to\nquestions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan\u2019s Ministry\nof Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on\ninvestigations.\nDuring the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific\nto uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This\nincluded interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement\nofficials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence\nreports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings\nand other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in\nMyanmar\u2019s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia\u2019s Golden\nTriangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing\ndrugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited\nthe Thai compound of one of the syndicate\u2019s alleged drug lords.\nWhat emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly\ntransnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the\nAFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often\nrefer to as \u201cT1\u201d - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong,\nMacau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.\nThe syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and\nsophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin\nAmerican cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies\na bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a\nmore diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels\ndo, including Japan\u2019s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic\nChinese gangs across Southeast Asia.\nThe crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled\noutbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police\nsay. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked\nrivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a\nunited pursuit of gargantuan profits.\n\u201cThe crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate\nwith seamless efficiency,\u201d says one veteran Western anti-drugs\nofficial. \u201cThey function like a global corporation.\u201d\nLike most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed,\nthe investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.\nIn addition to the contrasts between their drug operations,\nthere\u2019s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop\nand Joaquin \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed\nMexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine\ntrafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their\nextravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has\nbeen revealed about Tse\u2019s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug\nlords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.\n\nA TRIP, A TRAP\nTse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern\nChina, and grew up during China\u2019s Cultural Revolution. Amid the\nbloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group\nof imprisoned members of Mao\u2019s Red Guard in the southern city of\nGuangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big\nCircle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police,\nand like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong\nKong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their\ncriminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.\nIn the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong,\nMacau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based\nin Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling\nring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless\nopium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand,\nChina and Laos meet.\nIn 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on\ndrug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New\nYork. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into\nAmerica, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over\nhis head.\nThrough a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged\nfor leniency.\nHis ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His\n12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed.\nIf freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed\n\u201cgreat sorrow\u201d for his crime, court records show.\nThe entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to\nnine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional\ninstitution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.\nAfter he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to\nCanada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for\nthe next four years. It\u2019s unclear when Tse returned to his old\nhaunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife\nregistered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company\nLtd, in Hong Kong in 2011.\nPolice suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He\n\u201cpicked up where he left off,\u201d said the senior AFP investigator.\nTse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and\nthe Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved\nirresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his\ndrug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no\nextra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.\nHis policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for\nbusiness, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011,\nAFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and\nmeth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather\nthan arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under\nsurveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely\nfor more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug\ncell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They\nwanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.\nThe syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other\ndrug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and\nselling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the\nsyndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the\nMelbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police\nwatched the Australian meet two men.\nOne of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted\nhair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese\nfamily man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance\nshowed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal\nsecurity. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of\nThai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eight\nworked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as\npart of his security protocol.\nTse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts\nand five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in\nprivate jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand\nfor a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt,\naccording to a member of the task force investigating the\nsyndicate.\nTse was a frequent visitor to Asia\u2019s casinos and fond of\nbetting on horses, especially on English races. \u201cWe believe he\nlost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the\ntables in Macau,\u201d said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.\nAs the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected\nthat the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia\nwith meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA,\ncommonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the\nSam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say,\nwhen a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of\nwhite powder strapped to each of his thighs.\n\n\u2018ALADDIN\u2019S CAVE OF INTEL\u2019\nCai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the\nairport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It\nwas the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous,\npicking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said\na former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation.\n\u201cHis hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,\u201d the\ncommander told Reuters. \u201cMethamphetamine is very toxic.\u201d\nCai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs\nwas a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful\ntranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. \u201cWe were very\nfortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,\u201d the\ncommander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been\nmonitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police\nhad no idea who he was.\nCai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a\n\u201cpesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,\u201d according to\nMyanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A\nfriend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father.\nCai\u2019s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for\nketamine at the airport, the commander said.\nUnimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight.\nThe next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport.\nOne recognized him from surveillance work he\u2019d been conducting.\nStill, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they\nlater found on one of his phones might have explained his\nsilence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least\nthree assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch\nand electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said\none investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy\nsaying \u201cLoyalty to the Heavens.\u201d The banner was a \u201ctriad-related\nsign,\u201d he added.\nThe tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed\nthe video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat\nbecause he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a\nlaw enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of\nthe victim\u2019s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad\nmembers were sending a message about the price of disloyalty,\nthe officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.\nThe torture videos were just one of the items allegedly\nfound in Cai\u2019s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was\na diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate\u2019s activities, but\nsloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones,\npolice say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media\nconversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.\nThey were \u201can Aladdin\u2019s Cave of intel,\u201d said one AFP\ncommander based in North Asia.\nFor at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly\ntravelled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for\nthe syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the\nDrug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its\ninvestigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip\nfrom an international courier company recording the delivery of\ntwo consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf\nChinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea\npackets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had\nbeen cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.\nTwo days after Cai\u2019s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon\naddress, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That\nevening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon\njetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so,\nMyanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but\nother than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate,\nincluding couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.\nThen came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery\nof photos and videos on Cai\u2019s phones, an AFP investigator based\nin Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing\nhe had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier.\n\u201cThis one stuck out because it was Canadian,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI\nsaid: \u2018Fuck, I know who you are!'\u201d\nIt was Tse Chi Lop.\nThe Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of\nintelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work\non Cai\u2019s phones.\nAustralia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime\ngangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade,\nthe AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and\nsmall, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent\ndescribed the database, which includes a trove of names,\nchemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and\nsurveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence\non Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.\nThe AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai\u2019s\nphones with the database. They discovered photos related to\nthree big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in\nChina, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators\nand Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese\nanti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and\naddresses in Cai\u2019s phones to other meth busts in China.\nFor regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations\nupended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by\ndifferent crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the\nwork of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics\nagent said they believed Cai was \u201cone of the members of a\nmega-syndicate,\u201d which had been involved in multiple \u201cdrugs\ncases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.\u201d\nCai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still\nin jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking\ncharges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to\ncontact Cai\u2019s lawyer.\n\nMETH PARADISE\nDuring his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing\nthe country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and\nobtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a\nbigger vessel in international waters, according to police and\nthe Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures\nof the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where\nthe meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.\nThe police reconstruction of Cai\u2019s dealings in Myanmar led\nto another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production\nhad shifted from China\u2019s southern provinces to Shan State in\nMyanmar\u2019s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had\nprovided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor\ningredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were\nsmuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in\nthe Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the\nfreedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.\nArmed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan\nState have long controlled large tracts of territory and used\ndrug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the\nmilitary. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar\ngovernment with rebel groups over the years has brought relative\ncalm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to\nflourish.\n\u201cProduction facilities can be hidden from law enforcement\nand other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,\u201d\nanalyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the\nInternational Crisis Group. \u201cDrug production and profits are now\nso vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.\u201d\nThe Myanmar government and police did not respond to\nquestions from Reuters.\nAlong the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there\nis evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts\na deep ravine known as the \u201cValley of Death,\u201d where ethnic\nKachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for\ndecades with Myanmar\u2019s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past\ntrucks carrying building materials and workers.\nThe Kaung Kha militia\u2019s immaculate and expansive new\nheadquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green\nhills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers\naway, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved\nout of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned\nout vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba\ntablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine.\nWhen it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more\nthan 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg\nof caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances\nused in drug production.\nThe Loikan facility was \u201cvery likely\u201d to have been the\nsource of much of the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s meth, said the\nYangon-based AFP officer.\n\u201cSome militia were involved in the lab,\u201d said Oi Khun, a\ncommunications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia,\nin an interview. He paused, then added: \u201cBut not with the\nknowledge of senior members\u201d of the militia.\nOne person in Loikan described how workers from the lab\nwould come down from the hills. The men, like most of the\nvillagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the\nlocals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.\n\u201cI asked them once. \u2018Why don\u2019t you bathe?\u2019\u201d the person said.\n\u201cThey said they did, but there was nothing they could do about\nthe smell.\u201d\nThe rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the\nskin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature\nstench might reveal their illicit activities. \u201cWe all knew,\u201d the\nperson said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t talk about it. That just brings you\ndanger.\u201d\nMeth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals,\nsay Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network\u2019s\ncouriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the\nAsia-Pacific.\nShan\u2019s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the\nworld, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told\nReuters. \u201cThey can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the\nground and let it dry.\u201d\nThe UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth\nis worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business\nmodel for meth is \u201cvery different\u201d to heroin, said the UNODC\u2019s\nDouglas. \u201cInputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not\nneeded, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore\nfar, far higher.\u201d\nThe wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in\nnortheastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a\nUNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control\nCommission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to\nthe UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand,\n$298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the\nJapanese market, that\u2019s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.\nThe money the syndicate is making \u201cmeans that if they lose\nten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,\u201d\nsaid the Chinese counter-narcotics official. \u201cThey can afford\nfailure. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u2018MONEY, MONEY\u2019\nThe analysis of Cai\u2019s phones was continuing to provide\nleads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the\npick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with\nMyanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at\nsea for weeks.\nOne of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the\nShun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement\ndocument reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea\nwhen, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a\nmarine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and\npaid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV\nValkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s\nand hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea\nsickness tablets. According to local media, he didn\u2019t have a\nfishing license at the time.\nAfter buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on\na course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in\nthe Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the\nrendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western\nAustralian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was\nseen \u201cunloading a lot of packages\u201d into a van, the commander\nsaid.\n\u201cWe knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of\norganized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and\ncomes back with some gear on it, that it hasn\u2019t just dropped\nfrom the sky in the middle of the ocean.\u201d\nInvestigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car\nhire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug\ntraffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say,\nthat some of Smith\u2019s alleged co-conspirators were members of an\nethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and\nComanchero motorcycle gangs, known as \u201cbikies\u201d in Australia.\nAs they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of\ncrystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor\nsyndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy\nof an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians\nreconvened in Perth a month later.\nBikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and\na self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had\nrefined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star\nhotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police\ninvestigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants,\nsaid the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth.\nThe restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that\nincluded caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.\nOn November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again,\nthis time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the\nAndaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth\nfrom Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast\nof the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the\nIndian Ocean.\nThe Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.\nWhen the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in\ninternational waters off the West Australian coast on December\n19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting \u201cmoney, money,\u201d\naccording to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De\nMan\u2019s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith\nand his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved\ntheir identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by\nthe crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.\nThe Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of\nGeraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The\nmen unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of\nthe AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault\nweapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty\nto importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of\nhis alleged associates are still on trial.\nTaiwan\u2019s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it\nhad \u201cworked together with our counterparts on the investigation\u201d\nof the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the \u201csubstantial\nseizure of illicit narcotics\u201d by the Australian authorities in\nDecember 2017. The bureau said it was \u201caware that Taiwanese\nsyndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in\n(the) Asia-Pacific region,\u201d and was working \u201ccollaboratively and\nclosely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and\ncross-border drug trafficking.\u201d\n\nNIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED\nAs the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police\nconcluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone\na kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the\nthree biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the\n1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The\nother two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse\u2019s original triad, and the\nBamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator,\nthe syndicate\u2019s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that\nit \u201cmust rival Apple\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cThe syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market\nto tap,\u201d said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior\ncolonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade.\n\u201cThe power this network possesses is unimaginable.\u201d\nInvestigators have had wins. In February last year, police\nbusted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough\ntea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66\nwas intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than\none tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor\nlieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar.\nIn December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected\nsyndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.\nLocated near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed\ncompound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used\nto experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a\n100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to\nthe back of the property.\nSue wasn\u2019t there, but property and money from 38 bank\naccounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized\nduring the investigation. Sue is still at large.\nBut the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the\nwider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal\nmeth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and\nSoutheast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in\nmost countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising\nseizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019,\n\u201csuggested the supply of the drug had expanded.\u201d\nIn the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive\nadversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug\nmotherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product\nin shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth\ncoming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the\nsyndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This\nincluded deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each\ncontaining about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on\nnarrow jungle paths.\nOver the years, police have had little success in taking\ndown Asia\u2019s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders\nhave been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to\nthe AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics\nkingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than\na short period was in the mid-1970s. That\u2019s when Ng Sik-ho, a\nwily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced\nto 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium\nand morphine, according to court records.\nSo far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho\u2019s fate. He is being\ntracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say\ncounter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they\nbelieve he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.\n(Reporting by Tom Allard. Additional reporting by Reuters\nStaff. Editing by Peter Hirschberg.)",

        "text": "By Tom Allard\nBANGKOK (Reuters) - He is Asia\u2019s most-wanted man. He is protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private jet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night at a Macau casino.\nTse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected of leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate formed out of an alliance of five of Asia\u2019s triad groups, according to law enforcement officials. Its members call it simply \u201cThe Company.\u201d Police, in a nod to one of Tse\u2019s nicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for \u201cBrother Number Three.\u201d\nThe syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of methamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen countries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South Pacific. But meth \u2013 a highly addictive drug with devastating physical and mental effects on long-term users \u2013 is its main business, they say.\nIn what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s meth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be as high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the cartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a 40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has expanded at least fourfold in the past five years.\nThis unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an unprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the prime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously unreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the Australian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about 20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far the biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug trafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in the investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar, China, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan, while not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the investigation.\nA document containing AFP profiles of the operation\u2019s top 19 syndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the leader of the syndicate. According to the document, the organization has \u201cbeen connected with or directly involved in at least 13 cases\u201d of drug trafficking since January 2015. The document does not provide specific details of the cases.\nA Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the \u201cMultinational CEO\u201d of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional government agencies says Tse is \u201cbelieved to be\u201d the leader of the Sam Gor syndicate.\nPolice have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected boss of the trafficking group.\nSome investigators say that the scope of the syndicate\u2019s operation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin America\u2019s most legendary narco-traffickers. \u201cTse Chi Lop is in the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,\u201d said Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC. \u201cThe word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no doubt it applies here.\u201d\nReuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to questions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on investigations.\nDuring the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific to uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This included interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement officials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence reports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings and other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in Myanmar\u2019s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia\u2019s Golden Triangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing drugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited the Thai compound of one of the syndicate\u2019s alleged drug lords.\nWhat emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly transnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the AFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often refer to as \u201cT1\u201d - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.\nThe syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and sophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin American cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies a bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a more diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels do, including Japan\u2019s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic Chinese gangs across Southeast Asia.\nThe crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled outbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police say. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked rivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a united pursuit of gargantuan profits.\n\u201cThe crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate with seamless efficiency,\u201d says one veteran Western anti-drugs official. \u201cThey function like a global corporation.\u201d\nLike most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed, the investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.\nIn addition to the contrasts between their drug operations, there\u2019s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop and Joaquin \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed Mexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine trafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their extravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has been revealed about Tse\u2019s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug lords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.\n\nA TRIP, A TRAP\nTse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern China, and grew up during China\u2019s Cultural Revolution. Amid the bloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group of imprisoned members of Mao\u2019s Red Guard in the southern city of Guangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big Circle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police, and like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong Kong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their criminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.\nIn the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong, Macau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based in Asia. He rose to become a\u00a0mid-ranking member of a smuggling ring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless opium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand, China and Laos meet.\nIn 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on drug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New York. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into America, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over his head.\nThrough a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged for leniency.\nHis ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His 12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed. If freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed \u201cgreat sorrow\u201d for his crime, court records show.\nThe entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to nine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional institution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.\nAfter he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to Canada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for the next four years. It\u2019s unclear when Tse returned to his old haunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife registered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company Ltd, in Hong Kong in 2011.\nPolice suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He \u201cpicked up where he left off,\u201d said the senior AFP investigator. Tse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and the Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved irresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his drug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no extra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.\nHis policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for business, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011, AFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and meth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather than arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under surveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely for more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug cell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They wanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.\nThe syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other drug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and selling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the syndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the Melbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police watched the Australian meet two men.\nOne of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted hair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese family man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance showed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal security. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators.\u00a0Up to eight worked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as part of his security protocol.\nTse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts and five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in private jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand for a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt, according to a member of the task force investigating the syndicate.\nTse was a frequent visitor to Asia\u2019s casinos and fond of betting on horses, especially on English races. \u201cWe believe he lost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the tables in Macau,\u201d said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.\nAs the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected that the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia with meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the Sam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say, when a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of white powder strapped to each of his thighs.\n\n\u2018ALADDIN\u2019S CAVE OF INTEL\u2019\nCai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the airport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It was the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous, picking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said a former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation. \u201cHis hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,\u201d the commander told Reuters. \u201cMethamphetamine is very toxic.\u201d\nCai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs was a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful tranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. \u201cWe were very fortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,\u201d the commander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been monitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police had no idea who he was.\nCai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a \u201cpesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,\u201d according to Myanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A friend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father. Cai\u2019s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for ketamine at the airport, the commander said.\nUnimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight. The next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport. One recognized him from surveillance work he\u2019d been conducting.\nStill, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they later found on one of his phones might have explained his silence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least three assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch and electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said one investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy saying \u201cLoyalty to the Heavens.\u201d The banner was a \u201ctriad-related sign,\u201d he added.\nThe tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed the video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat because he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a law enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of the victim\u2019s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad members were sending a message about the price of disloyalty, the officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.\nThe torture videos were just one of the items allegedly found in Cai\u2019s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was a diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate\u2019s activities, but sloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones, police say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media conversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.\nThey were \u201can Aladdin\u2019s Cave of intel,\u201d said one AFP commander based in North Asia.\nFor at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly traveled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for the syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the Drug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its investigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip from an international courier company recording the delivery of two consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf Chinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea packets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had been cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.\nTwo days after Cai\u2019s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon address, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That evening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon jetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so, Myanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but other than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate, including couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.\nThen came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery of photos and videos on Cai\u2019s phones,\u00a0an AFP investigator based in Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing he had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier. \u201cThis one stuck out because it was Canadian,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI said: \u2018Fuck, I know who you are!'\u201d\nIt was Tse Chi Lop.\nThe Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of intelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work on Cai\u2019s phones.\nAustralia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime gangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade, the AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and small, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent described the database, which includes a trove of names, chemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and surveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence on Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.\nThe AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai\u2019s phones with the database. They discovered photos related to three big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in China, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators and Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese anti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and addresses in Cai\u2019s phones to other meth busts in China.\nFor regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations upended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by different crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the work of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics agent said they believed Cai was \u201cone of the members of a mega-syndicate,\u201d which had been involved in multiple \u201cdrugs cases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.\u201d\nCai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still in jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking charges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to contact Cai\u2019s lawyer.\n\nMETH PARADISE\nDuring his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing the country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and obtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a bigger vessel in international waters, according to police and the Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures of the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where the meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.\nThe police reconstruction of Cai\u2019s dealings in Myanmar led to another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production had shifted from China\u2019s southern provinces to Shan State in Myanmar\u2019s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had provided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor ingredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were smuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the freedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.\nArmed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan State have long controlled large tracts of territory and used drug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the military. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar government with rebel groups over the years has brought relative calm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to flourish.\n\u201cProduction facilities can be hidden from law enforcement and other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,\u201d analyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the International Crisis Group. \u201cDrug production and profits are now so vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.\u201d\nThe Myanmar government and police did not respond to questions from Reuters.\nAlong the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there is evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts a deep ravine known as the \u201cValley of Death,\u201d where ethnic Kachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for decades with Myanmar\u2019s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past trucks carrying building materials and workers.\nThe Kaung Kha militia\u2019s immaculate and expansive new headquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green hills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers away, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved out of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned out vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba tablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine. When it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more than 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg of caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances used in drug production.\nThe Loikan facility was \u201cvery likely\u201d to have been the source of much of the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s meth, said the Yangon-based AFP officer.\n\u201cSome militia were involved in the lab,\u201d said Oi Khun, a communications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia, in an interview. He paused, then added: \u201cBut not with the knowledge of senior members\u201d of the militia.\nOne person in Loikan described how workers from the lab would come down from the hills. The men, like most of the villagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the locals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.\n\u201cI asked them once. \u2018Why don\u2019t you bathe?\u2019\u201d the person said. \u201cThey said they did, but there was nothing they could do about the smell.\u201d\nThe rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the skin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature stench might reveal their illicit activities. \u201cWe all knew,\u201d the person said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t talk about it. That just brings you danger.\u201d\nMeth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals, say Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network\u2019s couriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the Asia-Pacific.\nShan\u2019s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the world, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told Reuters. \u201cThey can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the ground and let it dry.\u201d\nThe UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth is worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business model for meth is \u201cvery different\u201d to heroin, said the UNODC\u2019s Douglas. \u201cInputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not needed, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore far, far higher.\u201d\nThe wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in northeastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a UNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control Commission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to the UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand, $298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the Japanese market, that\u2019s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.\nThe money the syndicate is making \u201cmeans that if they lose ten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,\u201d said the Chinese counter-narcotics official. \u201cThey can afford failure. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u2018MONEY, MONEY\u2019\nThe analysis of Cai\u2019s phones was continuing to provide leads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the pick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with Myanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at sea for weeks.\nOne of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the Shun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement document reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea when, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a marine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and paid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV Valkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s and hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea sickness tablets. According to local media, he didn\u2019t have a fishing license at the time.\nAfter buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on a course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in the Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the rendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western Australian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was seen \u201cunloading a lot of packages\u201d into a van, the commander said.\n\u201cWe knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of organized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and comes back with some gear on it, that it hasn\u2019t just dropped from the sky in the middle of the ocean.\u201d\nInvestigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car hire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug traffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say, that some of Smith\u2019s alleged co-conspirators were members of an ethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and Comanchero motorcycle gangs, known as \u201cbikies\u201d in Australia.\nAs they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of crystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor syndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy of an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians reconvened in Perth a month later.\nBikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and a self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had refined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star hotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police investigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants, said the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth. The restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that included caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.\nOn November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again, this time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the Andaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth from Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the Indian Ocean.\nThe Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.\nWhen the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in international waters off the West Australian coast on December 19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting \u201cmoney, money,\u201d according to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De Man\u2019s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith and his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved their identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by the crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.\nThe Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of Geraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The men unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of the AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault weapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty to importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of his alleged associates are still on trial.\nTaiwan\u2019s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it had \u201cworked together with our counterparts on the investigation\u201d of the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the \u201csubstantial seizure of illicit narcotics\u201d by the Australian authorities in December 2017. The bureau said it was \u201caware that Taiwanese syndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in (the) Asia-Pacific region,\u201d and was working \u201ccollaboratively and closely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and cross-border drug trafficking.\u201d\n\nNIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED\nAs the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police concluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone a kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the three biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the 1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The other two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse\u2019s original triad, and the Bamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator, the syndicate\u2019s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that it \u201cmust rival Apple\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cThe syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market to tap,\u201d said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior colonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade. \u201cThe power this network possesses is unimaginable.\u201d\nInvestigators have had wins. In February last year, police busted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough tea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66 was intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than one tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor lieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar. In December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected syndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.\nLocated near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed compound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used to experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a 100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to the back of the property.\nSue wasn\u2019t there, but property and money from 38 bank accounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized during the investigation. Sue is still at large.\nBut the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the wider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal meth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and Southeast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in most countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising seizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019, \u201csuggested the supply of the drug had expanded.\u201d\nIn the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive adversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug motherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product in shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth coming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the syndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This included deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each containing about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on narrow jungle paths.\nOver the years, police have had little success in taking down Asia\u2019s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders have been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to the AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics kingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than a short period was in the mid-1970s. That\u2019s when Ng Sik-ho, a wily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium and morphine, according to court records.\nSo far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho\u2019s fate. He is being tracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say counter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they believe he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.\n\n\n\n (Reporting by Tom Allard. Additional reporting by Reuters Staff. Editing by Peter Hirschberg.)",

        "text": "(For more Reuters Special Reports, click on)\nBy Tom Allard\nBANGKOK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - He is Asia\u2019s most-wanted man. He\nis protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private\njet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night\nat a Macau casino.\nTse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected\nof leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate\nformed out of an alliance of five of Asia\u2019s triad groups,\naccording to law enforcement officials. Its members call it\nsimply \u201cThe Company.\u201d Police, in a nod to one of Tse\u2019s\nnicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for \u201cBrother Number\nThree.\u201d\nThe syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of\nmethamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen\ncountries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South\nPacific. But meth \u2013 a highly addictive drug with devastating\nphysical and mental effects on long-term users \u2013 is its main\nbusiness, they say.\nIn what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations\nOffice on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s\nmeth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be\nas high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the\ncartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a\n40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has\nexpanded at least fourfold in the past five years.\nThis unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an\nunprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the\nprime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously\nunreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the\nAustralian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about\n20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far\nthe biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug\ntrafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in\nthe investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar,\nChina, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan,\nwhile not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the\ninvestigation.\nA document containing AFP profiles of the operation\u2019s top 19\nsyndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the\nleader of the syndicate. According to the document, the\norganization has \u201cbeen connected with or directly involved in at\nleast 13 cases\u201d of drug trafficking since January 2015. The\ndocument does not provide specific details of the cases.\nA Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the\n\u201cMultinational CEO\u201d of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement\nAdministration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional\ngovernment agencies says Tse is \u201cbelieved to be\u201d the leader of\nthe Sam Gor syndicate.\nPolice have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected\nboss of the trafficking group.\nSome investigators say that the scope of the syndicate\u2019s\noperation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin\nAmerica\u2019s most legendary narco-traffickers. \u201cTse Chi Lop is in\nthe league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,\u201d said Jeremy\nDouglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC.\n\u201cThe word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no\ndoubt it applies here.\u201d\nReuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to\nquestions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan\u2019s Ministry\nof Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on\ninvestigations.\nDuring the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific\nto uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This\nincluded interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement\nofficials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence\nreports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings\nand other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in\nMyanmar\u2019s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia\u2019s Golden\nTriangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing\ndrugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited\nthe Thai compound of one of the syndicate\u2019s alleged drug lords.\nWhat emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly\ntransnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the\nAFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often\nrefer to as \u201cT1\u201d - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong,\nMacau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China.\nThe syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and\nsophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin\nAmerican cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies\na bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a\nmore diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels\ndo, including Japan\u2019s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic\nChinese gangs across Southeast Asia.\nThe crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled\noutbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police\nsay. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked\nrivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a\nunited pursuit of gargantuan profits.\n\u201cThe crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate\nwith seamless efficiency,\u201d says one veteran Western anti-drugs\nofficial. \u201cThey function like a global corporation.\u201d\nLike most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed,\nthe investigator spoke on condition of anonymity.\nIn addition to the contrasts between their drug operations,\nthere\u2019s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop\nand Joaquin \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed\nMexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine\ntrafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their\nextravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has\nbeen revealed about Tse\u2019s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug\nlords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.\n\nA TRIP, A TRAP\nTse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern\nChina, and grew up during China\u2019s Cultural Revolution. Amid the\nbloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group\nof imprisoned members of Mao\u2019s Red Guard in the southern city of\nGuangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big\nCircle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police,\nand like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong\nKong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their\ncriminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988.\nIn the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong,\nMacau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based\nin Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling\nring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless\nopium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand,\nChina and Laos meet.\nIn 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on\ndrug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New\nYork. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into\nAmerica, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over\nhis head.\nThrough a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged\nfor leniency.\nHis ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His\n12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed.\nIf freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed\n\u201cgreat sorrow\u201d for his crime, court records show.\nThe entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to\nnine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional\ninstitution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned.\nAfter he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to\nCanada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for\nthe next four years. It\u2019s unclear when Tse returned to his old\nhaunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife\nregistered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company\nLtd, in Hong Kong in 2011.\nPolice suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He\n\u201cpicked up where he left off,\u201d said the senior AFP investigator.\nTse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and\nthe Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved\nirresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his\ndrug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no\nextra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers.\nHis policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for\nbusiness, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011,\nAFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and\nmeth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather\nthan arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under\nsurveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely\nfor more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug\ncell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They\nwanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.\nThe syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other\ndrug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and\nselling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the\nsyndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the\nMelbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police\nwatched the Australian meet two men.\nOne of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted\nhair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese\nfamily man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance\nshowed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal\nsecurity. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of\nThai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eight\nworked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as\npart of his security protocol.\nTse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts\nand five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in\nprivate jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand\nfor a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt,\naccording to a member of the task force investigating the\nsyndicate.\nTse was a frequent visitor to Asia\u2019s casinos and fond of\nbetting on horses, especially on English races. \u201cWe believe he\nlost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the\ntables in Macau,\u201d said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator.\nAs the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected\nthat the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia\nwith meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA,\ncommonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the\nSam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say,\nwhen a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of\nwhite powder strapped to each of his thighs.\n\n\u2018ALADDIN\u2019S CAVE OF INTEL\u2019\nCai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the\nairport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It\nwas the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous,\npicking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said\na former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation.\n\u201cHis hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,\u201d the\ncommander told Reuters. \u201cMethamphetamine is very toxic.\u201d\nCai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs\nwas a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful\ntranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. \u201cWe were very\nfortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,\u201d the\ncommander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been\nmonitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police\nhad no idea who he was.\nCai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a\n\u201cpesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,\u201d according to\nMyanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A\nfriend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father.\nCai\u2019s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for\nketamine at the airport, the commander said.\nUnimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight.\nThe next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport.\nOne recognized him from surveillance work he\u2019d been conducting.\nStill, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they\nlater found on one of his phones might have explained his\nsilence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least\nthree assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch\nand electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said\none investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy\nsaying \u201cLoyalty to the Heavens.\u201d The banner was a \u201ctriad-related\nsign,\u201d he added.\nThe tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed\nthe video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat\nbecause he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a\nlaw enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of\nthe victim\u2019s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad\nmembers were sending a message about the price of disloyalty,\nthe officers said. Reuters has not seen the video.\nThe torture videos were just one of the items allegedly\nfound in Cai\u2019s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was\na diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate\u2019s activities, but\nsloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones,\npolice say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media\nconversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages.\nThey were \u201can Aladdin\u2019s Cave of intel,\u201d said one AFP\ncommander based in North Asia.\nFor at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly\ntravelled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for\nthe syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the\nDrug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its\ninvestigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip\nfrom an international courier company recording the delivery of\ntwo consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf\nChinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea\npackets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had\nbeen cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region.\nTwo days after Cai\u2019s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon\naddress, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That\nevening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon\njetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so,\nMyanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but\nother than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate,\nincluding couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking.\nThen came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery\nof photos and videos on Cai\u2019s phones, an AFP investigator based\nin Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing\nhe had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier.\n\u201cThis one stuck out because it was Canadian,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI\nsaid: \u2018Fuck, I know who you are!'\u201d\nIt was Tse Chi Lop.\nThe Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of\nintelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work\non Cai\u2019s phones.\nAustralia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime\ngangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade,\nthe AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and\nsmall, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent\ndescribed the database, which includes a trove of names,\nchemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and\nsurveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence\non Asian drug trafficking groups in the region.\nThe AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai\u2019s\nphones with the database. They discovered photos related to\nthree big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in\nChina, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators\nand Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese\nanti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and\naddresses in Cai\u2019s phones to other meth busts in China.\nFor regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations\nupended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by\ndifferent crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the\nwork of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics\nagent said they believed Cai was \u201cone of the members of a\nmega-syndicate,\u201d which had been involved in multiple \u201cdrugs\ncases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.\u201d\nCai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still\nin jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking\ncharges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to\ncontact Cai\u2019s lawyer.\n\nMETH PARADISE\nDuring his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing\nthe country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and\nobtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a\nbigger vessel in international waters, according to police and\nthe Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures\nof the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where\nthe meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat.\nThe police reconstruction of Cai\u2019s dealings in Myanmar led\nto another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production\nhad shifted from China\u2019s southern provinces to Shan State in\nMyanmar\u2019s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had\nprovided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor\ningredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were\nsmuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in\nthe Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the\nfreedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement.\nArmed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan\nState have long controlled large tracts of territory and used\ndrug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the\nmilitary. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar\ngovernment with rebel groups over the years has brought relative\ncalm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to\nflourish.\n\u201cProduction facilities can be hidden from law enforcement\nand other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,\u201d\nanalyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the\nInternational Crisis Group. \u201cDrug production and profits are now\nso vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.\u201d\nThe Myanmar government and police did not respond to\nquestions from Reuters.\nAlong the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there\nis evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts\na deep ravine known as the \u201cValley of Death,\u201d where ethnic\nKachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for\ndecades with Myanmar\u2019s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past\ntrucks carrying building materials and workers.\nThe Kaung Kha militia\u2019s immaculate and expansive new\nheadquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green\nhills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers\naway, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved\nout of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned\nout vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba\ntablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine.\nWhen it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more\nthan 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg\nof caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances\nused in drug production.\nThe Loikan facility was \u201cvery likely\u201d to have been the\nsource of much of the Sam Gor syndicate\u2019s meth, said the\nYangon-based AFP officer.\n\u201cSome militia were involved in the lab,\u201d said Oi Khun, a\ncommunications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia,\nin an interview. He paused, then added: \u201cBut not with the\nknowledge of senior members\u201d of the militia.\nOne person in Loikan described how workers from the lab\nwould come down from the hills. The men, like most of the\nvillagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the\nlocals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them.\n\u201cI asked them once. \u2018Why don\u2019t you bathe?\u2019\u201d the person said.\n\u201cThey said they did, but there was nothing they could do about\nthe smell.\u201d\nThe rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the\nskin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature\nstench might reveal their illicit activities. \u201cWe all knew,\u201d the\nperson said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t talk about it. That just brings you\ndanger.\u201d\nMeth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals,\nsay Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network\u2019s\ncouriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the\nAsia-Pacific.\nShan\u2019s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the\nworld, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told\nReuters. \u201cThey can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the\nground and let it dry.\u201d\nThe UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth\nis worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business\nmodel for meth is \u201cvery different\u201d to heroin, said the UNODC\u2019s\nDouglas. \u201cInputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not\nneeded, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore\nfar, far higher.\u201d\nThe wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in\nnortheastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a\nUNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control\nCommission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to\nthe UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand,\n$298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the\nJapanese market, that\u2019s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up.\nThe money the syndicate is making \u201cmeans that if they lose\nten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,\u201d\nsaid the Chinese counter-narcotics official. \u201cThey can afford\nfailure. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u2018MONEY, MONEY\u2019\nThe analysis of Cai\u2019s phones was continuing to provide\nleads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the\npick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with\nMyanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at\nsea for weeks.\nOne of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the\nShun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement\ndocument reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea\nwhen, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a\nmarine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and\npaid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV\nValkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s\nand hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea\nsickness tablets. According to local media, he didn\u2019t have a\nfishing license at the time.\nAfter buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on\na course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in\nthe Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the\nrendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western\nAustralian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was\nseen \u201cunloading a lot of packages\u201d into a van, the commander\nsaid.\n\u201cWe knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of\norganized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and\ncomes back with some gear on it, that it hasn\u2019t just dropped\nfrom the sky in the middle of the ocean.\u201d\nInvestigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car\nhire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug\ntraffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say,\nthat some of Smith\u2019s alleged co-conspirators were members of an\nethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and\nComanchero motorcycle gangs, known as \u201cbikies\u201d in Australia.\nAs they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of\ncrystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor\nsyndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy\nof an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians\nreconvened in Perth a month later.\nBikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and\na self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had\nrefined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star\nhotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police\ninvestigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants,\nsaid the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth.\nThe restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that\nincluded caviar with toast at about $185 per serving.\nOn November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again,\nthis time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the\nAndaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth\nfrom Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast\nof the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the\nIndian Ocean.\nThe Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened.\nWhen the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in\ninternational waters off the West Australian coast on December\n19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting \u201cmoney, money,\u201d\naccording to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De\nMan\u2019s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith\nand his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved\ntheir identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by\nthe crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth.\nThe Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of\nGeraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The\nmen unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of\nthe AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault\nweapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty\nto importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of\nhis alleged associates are still on trial.\nTaiwan\u2019s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it\nhad \u201cworked together with our counterparts on the investigation\u201d\nof the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the \u201csubstantial\nseizure of illicit narcotics\u201d by the Australian authorities in\nDecember 2017. The bureau said it was \u201caware that Taiwanese\nsyndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in\n(the) Asia-Pacific region,\u201d and was working \u201ccollaboratively and\nclosely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and\ncross-border drug trafficking.\u201d\n\nNIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED\nAs the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police\nconcluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone\na kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the\nthree biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the\n1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The\nother two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse\u2019s original triad, and the\nBamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator,\nthe syndicate\u2019s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that\nit \u201cmust rival Apple\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cThe syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market\nto tap,\u201d said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior\ncolonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade.\n\u201cThe power this network possesses is unimaginable.\u201d\nInvestigators have had wins. In February last year, police\nbusted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough\ntea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66\nwas intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than\none tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor\nlieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar.\nIn December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected\nsyndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand.\nLocated near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed\ncompound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used\nto experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a\n100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to\nthe back of the property.\nSue wasn\u2019t there, but property and money from 38 bank\naccounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized\nduring the investigation. Sue is still at large.\nBut the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the\nwider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal\nmeth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and\nSoutheast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in\nmost countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising\nseizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019,\n\u201csuggested the supply of the drug had expanded.\u201d\nIn the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive\nadversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug\nmotherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product\nin shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth\ncoming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the\nsyndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This\nincluded deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each\ncontaining about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on\nnarrow jungle paths.\nOver the years, police have had little success in taking\ndown Asia\u2019s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders\nhave been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to\nthe AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics\nkingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than\na short period was in the mid-1970s. That\u2019s when Ng Sik-ho, a\nwily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced\nto 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium\nand morphine, according to court records.\nSo far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho\u2019s fate. He is being\ntracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say\ncounter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they\nbelieve he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.\n(Reporting by Tom Allard. Additional reporting by Reuters\nStaff. Editing by Peter Hirschberg.)",

        "text": "By Nanchanok Wongsamuth\nSAMUT SAKHON, Thailand, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation)\n- Z in Mar was a housewife in the Burmese city of Bago when she\nsaw an advertisement for a job at Thai Union Group, a global\nseafood supplier and the world's biggest producer of tuna.\nThe 44-year-old paid a local recruitment agency about 4,300\nThai baht ($140) - less than half the sum that most migrants\nfrom Myanmar pay to win work in neighbouring Thailand.\nZin Mar is among the 23,000 Burmese workers Thai Union\nemployed under what the company calls its ethical migrant\nrecruitment policy.\nThree in four of its workers are migrants in a company that\noperates in 13 countries and is considered a leader in efforts\nto clean up an industry that was rife with worker abuse.\nFour years after the Thai seafood industry came under fire\nfor its work practices, the government and private sector have\nintroduced a raft of measures - from worker contracts to tighter\nlaws - to clean up the multi-billion dollar sector.\nThai Union was among the first to react, though campaigners\nsay smaller firms have copied its lead and the pace of reform\nmust continue if the industry is to ward off bad practice.\nThe industry was badly in need of a cleanup.\nIn 2014, it was accused of widespread slavery, trafficking\nand violence on fishing boats and in processing factories.\nLEADER OF THE PACK\nThai Union was among the first in an industry worth $6.6\nbillion to adopt an ethical recruitment policy in 2016, with\nhelp from the Migrant Worker Rights Network (MWRN), a local\nnon-profit assisting migrant workers, to reduce worker debt.\nDebt bondage is one of the world's most prevalent forms of\nmodern slavery, affecting 610,000 people in Thailand, shows the\nGlobal Slavery Index by rights group Walk Free Foundation.\nUnder debt bondage, workers are tricked into paying to get a\njob, then end up trapped in a never-ending cycle of repayments\nthat effectively means they work for free and are enslaved.\nUnder the more ethical Thai Union policy, it pays the\nrecruitment fees, while workers pay about 4,300 baht for\npermits, health checks, visas and other services.\nOne of the first collaborations between the private sector\nand civil society, it spawned a host of copies, such as the\nSeafood Task Force, a coalition of businesses and charities that\nregularly audits fishing vessels to prevent human rights abuses.\nCharoen Pokphand Foods, Thailand's largest agriculture\nconglomerate, has worked for two years with a campaign group\nthat helps migrant workers lodge complaints about their company.\nAnother firm, Seafresh Industry, has joined with the\nanti-trafficking Issara Institute to set up a migrant helpline.\n\"There's an increasing dialogue taking place between\nindustry and civil society,\" said Darian McBain, who joined Thai\nUnion in 2015 as global director of corporate affairs and\nsustainability.\n\nIOU\nThailand has 3 million migrant workers on its books; the\nUnited Nations estimates there are at least 2 million more\nworking illegally across the country.\nMany are mired in debt or were trafficked into Thailand\nagainst their will, worker rights activists say.\nAbout 55% of seafood processing workers paid a recruitment\nfee in Thailand averaging 11,000 baht ($360), according to a\n2018 report by the International Labour Organization.\n\"The first thing we did was give MWRN access to our facility\nso they could talk to workers,\" said McBain. \"And what they\nfound was that migrant workers were arriving from Myanmar in\nlarge debts that had built up as they journeyed to Thailand.\"\nThe company stopped employing migrants who had already got\nto Thailand and began recruiting directly from Myanmar through\nInternational Focus, an agent trained on the new policy.\nMWRN then ensures the recruits do not pay any extra fees.\n\"We have found cases of brokers charging workers up to\n500,000 kyat ($327) to find work with Thai Union, and when this\nhappens, we investigate what money they paid and who they paid\nit to and if necessary we'd pay it back,\" MWRN secretary general\nSein Htay told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nAbout 500,000 baht of fees have been returned to Thai Union\nworkers, he said.\nNow the challenge is to ensure workers pay no fees.\nJacques-chai Chomthongdi, a policy and campaign manager at\nBritish charity Oxfam, said workers could pay up to four times\nthe legal limit of 150,000 kyat at home to get work abroad.\n\"Workers still have to bear these costs, and those in debt\nare at risk of forced labour,\" Chomthongdi said.\nHe spoke on behalf of a coalition of civil society\norganisations that advise the Thai seafood industry.\nThai Union was a trailblazer in fighting modern slavery, he\nsaid, but smaller firms are now adopting similar policies in a\nbid to stamp out exploitation during the recruitment process.\n\"Other companies, some with a much smaller scale, are\nstarting to catch up,\" said Chomthongdi.\n\"This is a welcome development. However, if they (Thai\nUnion) don't adapt and ensure that the implementation of\nexisting good policies are maintained rigorously, they might\neventually become a follower.\"\n\n'BUSINESS AS USUAL'\nIn 2015, the European Union (EU) gave Thailand a \"yellow\ncard\" warning for failing to prevent illegal and unregulated\nfish from entering the supply chain and ending up in Europe. It\nrequired Thailand to clean up in six months or face a trade ban.\nThe EU removed the yellow card in January this year in light\nof efforts by Thailand to combat human trafficking and improve\nconditions for workers.\nBut fisheries associations - emboldened by a change in\ngovernment - are now pushing for a relaxation to the rules.\nAmong the demands: dropping age restrictions so 16-year-olds\ncan work on fishing boats, scrapping vessel inspections; letting\nvessels swap out crew and catch at sea, far from any oversight.\n\"One of the main challenges Thailand is facing at the moment\nis ensuring that the reforms that have been painstakingly\nintroduced over the past five years are not swiftly removed and\nreplaced with policies that would return the\nindustry to \u2018business as usual\u2019,\" said Steve Trent, executive\ndirector of Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF), an advocacy\ngroup that investigates environmental and human rights abuses.\nIndustry experts are also urging Thailand to grant migrant\nworkers the same rights in terms of freedom to organise and\ncollective bargaining as Thai workers.\nAt Thai Union, employees can email their concerns, post\nsuggestions to post boxes or call a third-party hotline.\n\"Collaboration and engagement is key to solving the world's\nbig challenges like ending modern slavery,\" McBain said.\n(Reporting by Nanchanok Wongsamuth @nanchanokw; Editing by\nLyndsay Griffiths.

        "text": "By Emma Batha\nLONDON, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - An estimated 10\nto 15 million people are not recognised as nationals by any\ncountry, often depriving them of basic rights most of the world\ntakes for granted such as education, healthcare, housing and\njobs.\nThe U.N. refugee agency is hosting a major intergovernmental\nmeeting in Geneva on Monday to assess progress at the midpoint\nof its #Ibelong campaign which aims to end statelessness by\n2024. Here are examples of stateless populations:\n\nMYANMAR/BANGLADESH: In 1982, Buddhist-majority Myanmar\npassed a citizenship law that effectively rendered stateless\nmost Rohingya, who are Muslim and of South Asian descent.\nEthnic violence has driven many to leave, but hundreds of\nthousands remain in Myanmar. There are about 900,000 Rohingya in\nneighbouring Bangladesh and smaller populations across Asia.\nSome are sold into slavery on fishing boats and plantations.\n\nIVORY COAST: Ivory Coast is home to 692,000 stateless\npeople. Many are descended from migrants from neighbouring\ncountries who were encouraged to work on Ivory Coast's coffee\nand cotton plantations in the 20th century.\nAt least a quarter of Ivory Coast's population is estimated\nto be of foreign descent, and the question of who is or is not\nIvorian helped fuel two civil wars in the West African country.\n\nTHAILAND: Nearly 479,000 people are stateless, including\nmembers of ethnic hill tribes such as the Yao, Hmong and Karen\nwho live in the mountainous border with Myanmar and Laos, and\nthe semi-nomadic \"Sea Gypsies\" along the Andaman coast.\n\nESTONIA/LATVIA: When the Soviet Union broke up, many ethnic\nRussians remained in the new Baltic states and were defined as\n\"non-citizens\".\nNearly 221,000 stateless people live in Latvia and 78,000 in\nEstonia, mainly ethnic Russians who have trouble obtaining\ncitizenship and at times face discrimination.\n\nSYRIA: In 1962, many Kurds in the northeast were stripped of\ncitizenship, a move Human Rights Watch described as part of a\nplan to \"Arabise\" the resource-rich region.\nBefore the civil war, there were an estimated 300,000\nstateless Kurds in Syria, many of whom were promised nationality\nby President Bashar al-Assad in reaction to the 2011 uprising.\nU.N. data suggests the number fell to 160,000, but this may\nbe partly because many fled the war.\nHuman rights experts have warned that babies born to Syrian\nrefugee women in Lebanon and Jordan could end up stateless.\n\nKUWAIT: Stateless people are known as Bidoon, which is short\nfor bidoon jinsiya meaning \"without nationality\" in Arabic. Some\ntrace their origins to nomadic tribes that once moved freely\naround the Gulf region.\nThere are about 92,000 Bidoon in Kuwait, according to U.N.\ndata, but some estimates are much higher. They are often barred\nfrom free education, healthcare and many jobs.\n\nNEPAL: Although Nepal says it does not have a stateless\npopulation, experts on statelessness believe many people,\npossibly hundreds of thousands, may be affected.\nPart of the problem derives from a law banning women married\nto foreigners from passing their nationality to their children.\nThere is also a stateless population of people who were expelled\nby Bhutan in the 1990s.\n\nDOMINICAN REPUBLIC: A 2013 court ruling, along with earlier\nchanges to nationality laws aimed at tackling illegal migration,\nhas left many stateless, mostly people of Haitian descent who\nwere born in Dominican Republic.\nIn 2015, there were about 134,000 stateless people,\naccording to U.N. data, but the figures are being updated.\n\nIRAQ: There are about 47,500 stateless people who include\nBidoon and Faili Kurds, an ethnic group that historically live\nboth sides of the Iraq-Iran border.\nMore than 100,000 Faili Kurds had their nationality revoked\nin 1980 under the Ba'ath regime. Although many have since had\ntheir nationality reinstated, others remain stateless.\n\nEUROPE: Tens of thousands of stateless Roma - an ethnic\ngroup with origins in India - are thought to live in central,\neastern and southern Europe. With the break-up of Czechoslovakia\nand Yugoslavia, successor states claimed they belonged\nelsewhere.\nOther Roma in Kosovo and Bosnia have become stateless due to\nwar-time displacement.\nRoma are often unable to register their children's births or\nhold official property titles. This can make it hard to prove\nwhere they are from.\n\nVENEZUELA: Some children born to Venezuelan parents who have\nfled to other countries amid a political and economic crisis at\nhome are at increased risk of statelessness.\n(Reporting by Emma Batha @emmabatha, Editing by Claire Cozens.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

        "text": "By Raya Jalabi\nSHARYA CAMP, Iraq (Reuters) - Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's death will mean nothing to 19-year-old rape victim Jamila unless the Islamic State militants who enslaved her are brought to justice.\nJamila, who asked not to be identified by her last name, is one of thousands of women from the Yazidi minority religion who were kidnapped and raped by IS after it mounted an assault on the Yazidi homeland in northern Iraq in August 2014.\n\"Even if Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead, it doesn't mean Islamic State is dead,\" Jamila told Reuters outside the tent that is now her temporary home in the Sharya camp for displaced Yazidis in Iraq's Kurdistan Region. \n\"This doesn't feel like justice yet,\" she said. \"I want the men who took me, who raped me, to stand trial. And I want to have my voice heard in court. I want to face them in court ... Without proper trials, his death has no meaning.\"\nBaghdadi, who had led IS since 2010, detonated a suicide vest after being cornered in a raid by U.S. special forces in northwest Syria, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Sunday.\nInspired by his edicts to enslave and slaughter Yazidis, whom IS regard as infidels, his followers shot, beheaded and kidnapped thousands in a rampage which the United Nations called a genocidal campaign against them.\nAlong with thousands of other women and children, Jamila said she was enslaved by the militants and kept in captivity for five months in the city of Mosul along with her sister. \nShe was just 14 when she was seized. But her problems did not end after she and her sister managed to escape when, she said, their guards were high on drugs.\n\"When I first came back, I had a nervous breakdown and psychological problems for two years, so I couldn't go to school,\" she said.\nNow instead of working or catching up on her years of lost schooling, she looks after her mother, with whom she shares her cramped tent at the camp. \n\"My mother can't walk and has health problems so I have to stay and take care of her because my older siblings are in Germany,\" she said.\n\nNO PLANS TO GO HOME\nThe prospect of going home to Sinjar in northern Iraq is not an option for Jamila, and many others.

And I want to\nhave my voice heard in court. I want to face them in court ...\nWithout proper trials, his death has no meaning.\"\nBaghdadi, who had led IS since 2010, detonated a suicide\nvest after being cornered in a raid by U.S. special forces in\nnorthwest Syria, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on\nSunday.\nInspired by his edicts to enslave and slaughter Yazidis,\nwhom IS regard as infidels, his followers shot, beheaded and\nkidnapped thousands in a rampage which the United Nations called\na genocidal campaign against them.\nAlong with thousands of other women and children, Jamila\nsaid she was enslaved by the militants and kept in captivity for\nfive months in the city of Mosul along with her sister.\nShe was just 14 when she was seized. But her problems did\nnot end after she and her sister managed to escape when, she\nsaid, their guards were high on drugs.\n\"When I first came back, I had a nervous breakdown and\npsychological problems for two years, so I couldn't go to\nschool,\" she said.\nNow instead of working or catching up on her years of lost\nschooling, she looks after her mother, with whom she shares her\ncramped tent at the camp.\n\"My mother can't walk and has health problems so I have to\nstay and take care of her because my older siblings are in\nGermany,\" she said.\n\nNO PLANS TO GO HOME\nThe prospect of going home to Sinjar in northern Iraq is not\nan option for Jamila, and many others. The city still lies in\nruin four years after the IS onslaught, and suspicion runs deep\nin the ethnically mixed area.\n\"Sinjar is completely destroyed.

The latest was on Oct. 4 when a gay\nrights activist was bludgeoned to death.\nEarlier this week 16 LGBT+ activists were detained and\ncharged for having gay sex after police raided their charity\noffice and residence, forcing them to undergo anal examinations.\nLast weekend a gay Rwandan refugee was beaten outside his\noffice in Kampala and a lesbian woman physically assaulted by\nher doctor, say activists.\nPolice said they had not registered any cases of assaults\nspecifically targeting sexual minorities.\nUganda's minister of health said on Friday that she was\naware of some of the attacks on the LGBT+ community and appealed\nto health care providers not to discriminate against them.\nLGBT+ activists welcomed the statements, but said more\naction was needed to ensure sexual minorities could live free\nfrom fear.\n\"We would also urge the government to enact legislation\nagainst hate crimes and publicly condemn hate speech such as\nwhat is being said by some politicians which fuels homophobia,\"\nsaid Frank Mugisha, head of Sexual Minorities Uganda.\nCharges against the 16 activists were a \"sham\" and should be\ndropped, he added.\nUganda's Ethics and Integrity Minister Simon Lokodo said on\nOct. 10 that the government planned to re-introduce an\nanti-homosexuality bill in parliament within weeks to curb the\nspread of homosexuality.\nLokodo's statement was widely reported and international\ndonors to Uganda said they were monitoring the situation closely\nand stood by the rights of LGBT+ people.\nA spokesperson for President Museveni later denied the plan,\nsaying Uganda's current penal law - which provides for up to\nlife imprisonment for gay sex - was sufficient.\n\n(Reporting by Nita Bhalla @nitabhalla, Editing by Claire\nCozens.

        "text": "By Nita Bhalla\nNAIROBI, Oct 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda said\non Thursday it had arrested 16 LGBT+ activists on suspicion of\ngay sex - punishable with life in jail - in what campaigners\ncalled an escalating campaign against sexual minorities in the\neast African nation.\nThe 16 men, believed to be aged from 22 to 35, were taken\ninto custody late on Monday at the office of a sexual health\ncharity where they all worked and lived, fellow activists said.\nIt was not clear if the men had been formally charged or\nwhen they might appear in court.\nA police spokesman said officers had found lubricants,\ncondoms and anti-retroviral drugs at the charity, and had\nconducted anal examinations on all 16.\n\"Based on the medical examination report, it was established\nthat the suspects were involved in sexual acts punishable under\nthe penal code,\" police spokesman Patrick Onyango told the\nThomson Reuters Foundation.\nFred Enanga, Uganda's national police spokesman, said the\nstate attorney was considering the case before any court\nappearance.\nGay sex carries a possible life sentence in Uganda, one of\nthe most difficult countries in Africa to be a sexual minority\nwith increasingly violent confrontation over sexual freedom.\nMembers of the LGBT+ community say they risk physical\nattacks in their daily life and routinely encounter harassment,\nas well as facing prejudice over work, housing and health care.\nCampaigners have reported a spate of attacks this year -\nincluding four murders - with the latest on Oct. 4 when a gay\nrights activist was bludgeoned to death.\nPolice say they know of no such attacks.\nEarlier this month, a minister proposed introducing the\ndeath penalty for gay sex, a threat retracted by the government\nafter international donors condemned the move.\nActivists said the raid was a new step-up by police.\n\"Normally we will hear of maybe one arrest of someone from\nthe community under these anti-gay laws in one month, but it is\nreally unusual to see 16 people charged like this,\" said Frank\nMugisha, executive director of Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG).\n\"The 16 activists have been held by police for over 48\nhours, forced to undergo anal examinations. We are expecting\nthem to be produced before court today.\"\nThe men all worked for a charity called \"Lets Walk Uganda\",\nwhose offices are on the outskirts of the capital Kampala.\nThey were initially taken into \"protective custody\" after a\ncrowd yelling homophobic slogans surrounded their office, rights\ngroups said. Police said the group was detained after they were\nalerted to \"illegal activities\" by the community.\nUnder the penal code, any person who has \"carnal knowledge\nagainst the order of nature\" - gay sex - or anyone who accedes\nto anal sex is liable to life imprisonment.\n(Reporting by Nita Bhalla @nitabhalla, Editing by Lyndsay\nGriffiths.

        "text": "By Umberto Bacchi\nCOPENHAGEN, Oct 11 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Young\nactivists demonstrating across the world are driving cities to\nstep up action on climate change, not least because politicians\nkeep coming face-to-face with them while going about their\nbusiness, mayors at a climate conference heard Friday.\nAs activists from Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg to\n\"Extinction Rebellion\" movement protesters take an increasingly\nvisible stand on climate change, officials feel growing\npressure to respond, mayors gathered in Copenhagen said.\n\"If you want to walk the streets of some of the biggest\ncities in Poland, you've got to do something about climate\nchange,\" Warsaw's mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski, told the C40 summit\nof mayors committed to action on climate change.\n\"The pressure especially from young people is just\nenormous,\" he said. \"They are fed up with declarations, with\ngoals and priorities ... they want to see results\".\nLeaders of more than 90 cities representing more than 700\nmillion people and a quarter of the global economy met in the\nDanish capital this week to push for faster action to stem\nclimate threats.\nThe gathering came as Extinction Rebellion climate change\nactivists took to the streets from London to New Zealand for two\nweeks of peaceful civil disobedience.\n\"Mayors are on the frontline now,\" former U.S. vice\npresident Al Gore told the conference. \"You do not have the\nluxury of just going away and reading reports about what is\ngoing on. You run into your constituents every single day.\"\nOn Thursday Extinction Rebellion protesters attempted to\nshut down London City Airport, with one protester laying on top\nof a plane. On Friday they blocked the headquarters of the BBC,\nBritain's public service broadcaster..\nEarlier this week, French members of the movement blocked a\nstreet and bridge in Paris' Chatelet district.\nThe city's mayor, Anne Hidalgo, said she shared their\nconcern.\n\"We are facing threats of climate breakdown \u2013 the response\nthat we're seeing from Extinction Rebellion and young climate\nstrikers around the globe should come as no surprise,\" she said.\nIn Copenhagen, city leaders unveiled a series of pledges and\nmeasures to cut planet warming emissions, from reducing meat\nconsumption to tackling air pollution with cheap bus fares and\nvehicle bans.\nBut delegates at the summit opening Wednesday were met by\ndemonstrators from Klima Aktion DK, a local climate action\ngroup, armed with fake binoculars made from toilet rolls.\n\"Our message to the C40 Mayors is: The people are watching\nyou! We want to see action!\" the group wrote on Facebook.\n\nEMPTY WORDS\nCities are vital to limit global warming as they account for\nabout three-quarters of carbon emissions and consume more than\ntwo-thirds of global energy, according to the United Nations.\nWider use of existing clean technologies - such as electric\nbuses - could deliver more than half the cuts needed to keep\nglobal temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees\nFahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the U.N. says.\nWorld leaders agreed in the 2015 Paris Agreement to hold\ntemperate hikes to \"well below\" 2 degrees Celsius.\n\"Cities are where the climate battle will largely be won or\nlost,\" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the\nCopenhagen summit.\nYouth activists invited to the meeting to discuss possible\nclimate measures demanded a bigger seat at the table and called\nfor stronger action.\n\"We should be a part of the decision process when decisions\nregarding our future are being taken,\" said Selma Norgard, a\nyoung Danish climate activist.\nLuisa Neubauer, a founder of the German branch of Fridays\nfor Future, the movement started by Thunberg, said her 10 months\nof activism on climate change had taught her to distrust\npoliticians.\n\"We have become experts in listening to empty words and to\nhearing empty promises over and over again. That is painful,\"\nshe said.\n\"We just ask to grow old on a planet that can provide\nlivelihoods for all of us, no matter where we are born\".\nHilda Nakabuye, the founder of Fridays for Future in Uganda,\nsaid her family had been forced to sell of its land and\nlivestock as heavy rains, high winds and dry spells linked to\nclimate change had wiped away crops and made the soil barren.\n\"Your beds might be comfortable right now but not for long.\nYou'll soon feel the same heat that we feel every day,\" she\nwarned.\n\nNO MAGIC WAND\nMany mayors in attendance said they were inspired by the\nresolve shown by young activists - and somewhat surprised by the\nrapid growth of their movement.\nMilan's mayor, Giuseppe Sala, said the city council was\nplanning to consult young people in climate matters.\nBut translating ideas into concrete action was not always\neasy, as not everybody agrees on what should be done, said the\nmayor of Lisbon, Fernando Medina.\nEven simple measures such as creating more cycle lanes often\nface opposition from residents and politicians when, for\nexample, they encroach on parking spaces, he said.\n\"I don't have a magic wand,\" he said. \"But I can tell (young\npeople) that I can work every day to make things happen more\nquickly\".\nOthers lamented that cities alone could not solve the\nclimate crisis.\n\"Cities are leading the change, but countries need to do\ntheir part too,\" said the mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau.\nAt least 70 countries announced plans at a U.N. climate\naction summit last month to boost their effors to cut emissions,\nbut most major economies, including the United States and China,\nfailed to announce stronger new measures.\nThe world is now at a crossroads between \"extinction or\nopportunity\", said U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a\nDemocratic member of Congress.\n\"Every decision we make between now and (within) our\nchildren's lifetimes will determine how human life will fare,\nwhether we'll suffer greatly or build together,\" she told the\nsummit.\n(Reporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Laurie\nGoering.

        "text": "By Nellie Peyton\nNEW YORK, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda on\nThursday announced plans for a bill that would impose the death\npenalty on homosexuals, following plans announced by Brunei\nearlier this year to do the same.\nSame-sex relations are illegal in at least 68 countries\naround the world, according to the International Lesbian, Gay,\nBisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA).\nIn addition to Uganda and Brunei, here are eight countries\nthat have recently moved to roll back LGBT+ rights.\n\n1. United States\nThe United States began implementing a ban on transgender\npeople serving in the military this year, after President Donald\nTrump announced the change in 2017.\nTrump cited medical costs as one reason for rolling back a\n2016 policy of his predecessor Barack Obama, which had allowed\ntransgender people to serve openly for the first time and also\nreceive medical care to transition genders.\n\n2. Russia\nRussia fined its first minor last year under a so-called\n\"gay propaganda\" law that has been increasingly used to repress\nthe LGBT+ community.\nThe 2013 law makes illegal any event or act regarded by the\nauthorities as an attempt to promote homosexuality to minors. It\nhas been used to stop gay pride marches and detain gay rights\nactivists.\n\n3. Poland\nPoland's ruling party leader condemned gay pride marches\nthis year and said the rule of law should be used to regulate\nwhat he called a \"travelling theatre\".\nAhead of elections later this month, the conservative Law\nand Justice (PiS) party has used its anti-LGBT+ stance as a key\ncampaign issue, which critics say has fomented violence toward\nthe gay community.\n\n4. Indonesia\nIndonesia has drafted a law that would ban gay sex, which\nparliament delayed voting on last month amid protests.\nThe proposed revisions to the criminal code also include a\nban on sex outside of marriage, a four-year jail term for\nabortions in the absence of a medical emergency or rape and a\nprison term for black magic.\n\n5. Nigeria\nNigeria passed a bill in 2014 that criminalized same-sex\nrelationships with penalties of up to 14 years in prison.\nAuthorities charged 43 people with homosexual acts in one\ncase in 2017, ordering most to undergo monitoring and \"sexual\nrehabilitation.\"\n\n6. Malaysia\nMalaysia's LGBT+ community has faced growing persecution,\nwith two women caned in public for \"attempting lesbian sex\" in\nthe state of Terengganu last year.\nPrime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the leader of a new\ngovernment elected last year, has said the country cannot accept\nsame-sex marriage or LGBT+ rights.\n\n7. Chad\nChad introduced a new penal code in 2017 with light prison\nsentences and fines for same-sex relations which had not been\nexplicitly criminalized before, although there was a law\ncondemning \"acts against nature\", according to the ILGA.\nAn earlier draft of the legislation from 2014 would have\ncriminalized gay sex with up to 20 years in prison.\n\n8. Slovakia\nSlovakia inserted a definition of traditional marriage in\nits constitution in 2014.\nIn 2015 the country held a referendum which would have\nstrengthened its ban on marriage and child adoption by same-sex\ncouples, but it failed to pass on low voter turnout.\n(Writing by Nellie Peyton; Editing by Chris Michaud.

        "text": "(Updates with fresh details, quotes throughout)\nBy Nita Bhalla\nNAIROBI, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda\nannounced plans on Thursday for a bill that would impose the\ndeath penalty on homosexuals, saying the legislation would curb\na rise in unnatural sex in the east African nation.\nThe bill - colloquially known as \"Kill the Gays\" in Uganda -\nwas nullified five years ago on a technicality and the\ngovernment said it plans to resurrect it within weeks.\n\"Homosexuality is not natural to Ugandans, but there has\nbeen a massive recruitment by gay people in schools, and\nespecially among the youth, where they are promoting the\nfalsehood that people are born like that,\" Ethics and Integrity\nMinister Simon Lokodo told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\"Our current penal law is limited. It only criminalises the\nact. We want it made clear that anyone who is even involved in\npromotion and recruitment has to be criminalised. Those that do\ngrave acts will be given the death sentence.\"\nAfrican countries have some of the world's most prohibitive\nlaws governing homosexuality. Same-sex relationships are\nconsidered taboo and gay sex is a crime across most of the\ncontinent, with punishments ranging from imprisonment to death.\nEarlier this year, Brunei sparked international outcry over\nplans to impose the death penalty for gay sex, backtracking only\nafter intense criticism.\nNow Uganda wants to follow suit.\nLokodo said the bill, which is supported by President Yoweri\nMuseveni, will be re-introduced in parliament in the coming\nweeks and is expected to be voted on before the end of the year.\nHe was optimistic it would pass with the necessary\ntwo-thirds of members present - a shortfall in numbers killed a\nsimilar bill in 2014 - as the government had lobbied legislators\nahead of its re-introduction, Lokodo added.\n\"We have been talking to the MPs and we have mobilised them\nin big numbers,\" said Lokodo. \"Many are supportive.\"\nUganda's constitutional court overturned the law - formerly\nknown as the \"Kill the Gays\" bill because it includes the death\npenalty - on a technicality in 2014.\nEven without it, Uganda is one of the hardest countries in\nAfrica to be a sexual minority. Under British colonial law, gay\nsex is punishable with up to life imprisonment and activists\nsaid the new bill risked unleashing attacks.\n\"Bringing back anti-gay legislation would invariably lead to\na spike in discrimination and atrocities,\" said Zahra Mohamed of\nthe Toronto-based charity Stephen Lewis Foundation.\n\nFEARFUL\nMoves to restrict LGBT+ rights and criminalise gay sex in\nother countries have sparked protests and sanctions.\nIn May, Brunei was forced to extend a moratorium on the\ndeath penalty for gay sex after celebrities such as actor George\nClooney condemned a law allowing whipping and stoning to death.\nLast November, anti-gay remarks by a senior official in\nTanzania led to the east African nation's second biggest donor,\nDenmark, withholding $10 million in aid.\nUganda faced widespread international condemnation when the\nprevious bill was signed off by Museveni in 2014.\nThe United States reduced aid, imposed visa restrictions and\ncancelled military exercises. The World Bank, Sweden, Norway,\nDenmark and the Netherlands also suspended or redirected aid.\nLokodo said Uganda was prepared for any negative response.\n\"It is a concern,\" he said.\n\"But we are ready. We don't like blackmailing. Much as we\nknow that this is going to irritate our supporters in budget and\ngovernance, we can't just bend our heads and bow before people\nwho want to impose a culture which is foreign to us.\"\nPepe Julian Onziema from Sexual Minorities Uganda, an\nalliance of LGBT+ organisations, said its members were fearful.\n\"When the law was introduced last time, it whipped up\nhomophobic sentiment and hate crimes,\" said Onziema.\n\"Hundreds of LGBT+ people have been forced to leave the\ncountry as refugees and more will follow if this law is enacted.\nIt will criminalise us from even advocated for LGBT+ rights, let\nalone supporting and protecting sexual minorities.\"\nOnziema said three gay men and one transgender woman had\nbeen killed in homophobic attacks in Uganda this year - the\nlatest last week when a gay man was bludgeoned to death.\n(Reporting by Nita Bhalla.

        "text": "(Adds Biden comments)\nBy Patricia Zengerle and Richard Cowan\nWASHINGTON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump\non Tuesday again waded into America's fraught racial history by\nlabeling the impeachment inquiry against him a \"lynching\" -\nlanguage that conjured memories of decades of killings of\nthousands of black people - drawing swift bipartisan\ncondemnation.\n\"All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here\n- a lynching. But we will WIN!\" Trump wrote on Twitter,\nreferring to the impeachment inquiry https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whistleblower/envoy-testifies-trump-tied-ukraine-aid-to-politically-motivated-investigations-idUSKBN1X10BC\nin the Democratic-led House of Representatives focusing on his\nrequest that Ukraine investigate a domestic political rival,\nDemocrat Joe Biden.\nLynching refers to the murder of thousands of Americans,\nmost of them black, between the 1880s and 1960s, as\nAfrican-Americans struggled for their rights as U.S. citizens in\nthe aftermath of the Civil War in which Southern states fought\nin vain to maintain black slavery.\n\"The president should not compare a constitutionally\nmandated impeachment inquiry to such a dangerous and dark\nchapter of American history. It's irresponsible for him to do\nso, and I hope that he will apologize,\" said House Democratic\nCaucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, who is black.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said,\n\"Given the history in our country, I would not compare this to a\nlynching. That was an unfortunate choice of words.\" McConnell\nadded that he viewed the House inquiry as \"an unfair process\"\nthat is denying Trump \"procedural safeguards.\"\nDemocrats and other critics have previously accused Trump of\nstoking racial divisions while trying to appeal to his largely\nwhite core of conservative Republican voters, noting his comment\nin 2017 that there were \"very fine people on both sides\" at a\nrally by white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia in\nwhich a counter-protester was killed.\nSome Republican allies agreed with Trump's use of the word\nlynching.\n\"It shows a lot of things about our national media. When\nit's about Trump, who cares about the process, as long as you\nget him. So, yeah, this is a lynching in every sense. This is\nun-American,\" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, whose home\nstate of South Carolina has a large black population, told\nreporters.\nTrump has a long and controversial history on race including\ndecades-old allegations of discrimination in his family's real\nestate business. He also championed the death penalty for five\nblack and Latino teens wrongly accused of raping a white woman\nin 1989 in New York's Central Park, used an expletive to\ndescribe African countries in 2018, and singled out black\nathletes for criticism after they failed to stand for the\nnational anthem while protesting racial inequity.\n\n'HISTORICAL TRAGEDIES'\nTrump's lynching comment was immediately condemned by\ncritics as unbecoming of a president.\n\"For him to say something like that was disgusting, reflects\nhis insensitivity toward the historical tragedies of this\ncountry,\" said Representative Barbara Lee, who said she was not\nsurprised or shocked by Trump's comments but \"just very, very\ndisappointed.\"\n\"For Trump to characterize a legal impeachment inquiry as a\nlynching shows a complete disrespect for the thousands of Black\npeople lynched - murdered - throughout our nation's history in\nacts of racism and hatred,\" said Karen Baynes-Dunning, interim\npresident of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which advocates\nfor equal opportunity and fights bigotry.\nThe impeachment inquiry is focused on Trump's request during\na July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr\nZelenskiy that he investigate a domestic political rival, former\nvice president Joe Biden. Biden is a leading contender to become\nthe Democratic 2020 presidential nominee to run against Trump.\nBiden said on Twitter that Trump's use of the word was\n\"abhorrent\" and \"despicable.\"\nBiden, however, said in 1998 the impeachment of President\nBill Clinton could be seen as a \"partisan lynching.\" Biden\napologized in a tweet late on Tuesday, saying it \"wasn't the\nright word to use and I\u2019m sorry about that.\"\nSenator Tim Scott, the only black Republican U.S. senator\nand one of just two black Republicans in Congress, said of\nTrump's comment, \"I get his absolute rejection of the process,\"\nbut said he would not use the word lynching. Scott, like Graham,\nrepresents South Carolina.\nRepublican Jeb Bush, a former Florida governor who ran in\nthe party's 2016 presidential nomination contest won by Trump,\nwrote on Twitter: \"The President is not a victim. He should be\nthe most powerful person on the planet. To equate his plight to\nlynching is grotesque.\"\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, a leading Democratic presidential\ncandidate, wrote on Twitter, \"Lynching is a horrific stain on\nour country's history, and it is beyond disgraceful for Donald\nTrump to invoke one to avoid being held accountable for his\ncrimes.\"\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley defended Trump.\n\"The president was clearly articulating the way he feels and\nthe way you guys have treated him from day one,\" Gidley told\nreporters.\n(Reporting by Patricia Zengerle and Richard Cowan; Additional\nreporting by Alexandra Alper and Susan Heavey; editing by Will\nDunham, Grant McCool and Himani Sarkar)",

        "text": "By Kieran Guilbert\nLONDON, Oct 21  (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A landmark\nlegal challenge will be filed in Britain on Monday over cotton\nimports from Uzbekistan in a case lawyers say could pave the way\nto stop slave-made goods entering the European Union (EU).\nThe legal action says imports of Uzbek cotton into EU\nnations are unlawful because the bloc has applied preferential\ntariffs without investigating the human rights situation in\nUzbekistan or its compliance with international law obligations.\nThis violates EU rules and means many of its 28 members are\nfacilitating a trade in cotton produced by a state-driven system\nof forced labour, according to the Uzbek-German Forum for Human\nRights (UGF), the civil society group behind the case.\nThe Central Asian nation has acknowledged the use of forced\nlabour in its cotton harvest, and vowed to \"eradicate\" the\nproblem.\nThe lawyers behind the case hope it will succeed in London's\nAdministrative Court - part of the High Court of Justice - and\nbe referred to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg where\nany decision or ruling would be legally binding across the EU.\nSuch action could range from forcing the EU to conduct due\ndiligence into Uzbekistan's cotton production to a ruling that\nwould effectively stop the entry into the bloc of goods known to\nbe produced by forced labour, said lawyers supporting the case.\n\"This approach is unprecedented ... it aims to disrupt the\nunhindered importation of forced labour cotton into Europe,\"\nsaid Gerry Liston, legal officer at Global Legal Action Network\n(GLAN), a Britain-based charity helping UGF with the case.\n\"If successful, it would have implications for all sorts of\ngoods tainted with forced labour (in the EU),\" he added.\nListon pointed to a 2016 U.S. law that allows customs\nofficials to seize and detain goods suspected to have been made\nby slave labour, and said a positive ruling could drive the EU's\nlegislative bodies to adopt similar measures affecting the bloc.\nThe case comes at a vital time for EU-Uzbek relations as the\nbloc is negotiating an agreement with Uzbekistan that would see\npreferential tariffs extended to its textile exports, he added.\nA spokeswoman for trade matters with the European Commission\n(EC) - the EU's executive arm - said it did not comment on legal\nproceedings in front of national courts.\n\"As regards developments in Uzbekistan, we follow them\nclosely, as this is relevant for our overall trade engagement,\"\nshe said, adding that the EC followed the U.N. International\nLabour Organization (ILO) on the application of work standards.\nThe ILO last year said 93% of those who worked in the 2018\nUzbek cotton harvest did so voluntarily, and the systematic\nrecruitment of students, teachers, doctors and nurses had ended\n- although this was disputed by human rights groups such as\nUGF.\nIn response to a request for comment put to Britain's\ninternational trade department, a spokesman said the government\n\"does not generally comment on ongoing or potential litigation\".\nLast year Britain, which gives preferential tariffs to\nUzbekistan, imported 360,000 pounds ($455,000) of Uzbek cotton,\n- 0.1% of its total cotton imports in 2018 - state data showed.\n\nUZBEK COTTON COMMITMENT\nThe annual cotton harvest in Uzbekistan is the world's\nlargest recruitment operation, with about 2.6 million people\ntemporarily picking cotton every year, according to the ILO.\nPrime Minister Abdulla Aripov, who has been opening up the\ncountry since taking office in 2016, has vowed to stop thousands\nof students, teachers and health workers from picking the\nharvest, a practice widely condemned as forced labour.\n\"The government of Uzbekistan remains fully committed to\neradicating forced labour in the cotton harvest,\" Erkin\nMukhitdinov, first deputy minister at the country's labour\nministry, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation via email.\n\"We have taken a number of steps including increased wages,\nimproved working and living conditions, reduced areas allocated\nfor cotton production,\" he said, without responding directly to\na request for comment on the upcoming court proceedings.\nHowever, Berlin-based UGF last year said in a report that\nstate-imposed forced labour was still \"systematic and massive\".\nUnder a 2012 EU regulation, Uzbek cotton imports receive a\npreferential tariff under the Generalised Scheme of Preferences,\nwhich seeks to facilitate trade with certain developing nations.\nBut the legal motion said this regulation was void as a\nmatter of EU law, and cannot be applied by Britain or any member\nstate of the bloc to cotton imports from Uzbekistan.\nUGF said this was because the EU had not assessed the human\nrights implications of applying tariffs to Uzbek cotton nor\nconsidered the nation's compliance with an ILO convention on\nforced labour to which it is a party.\nUGF Director Umida Niyazova said she hoped the legal action\nwould attract international attention and influence Uzbekistan's\ngovernment to change the \"system of forced labour\".\n\"Any kind of global pressure at this point ... at this time\n..  could be very effective,\" she said. \"This case could be the\nlast straw, and an important moment for the Uzbek people.\"\n\n($1 = 0.7912 pounds)\n(Reporting by Kieran Guilbert, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith.\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.

        "text": "(Fixes job title in paragraph 23)\nBy Emma Batha\nLONDON, Oct 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The deaths of\n39 migrants found in a refrigerated truck in Britain has\nreignited calls for efforts to tackle slavery in the nail bar\nsector, a common destination for trafficked Vietnamese.\nMost of the people discovered in the truck are believed to\nbe from Vietnam, one of the top source countries for victims of\nmodern slavery in Britain - accounting for about 10% of 7,000\nsuspected slaves referred to the government for support in 2018.\nPolice are still investigating the case and it is not yet\nclear why the victims were travelling to Britain.\nBut it is well documented that some Vietnamese - lured to\nEurope by promises of lucrative jobs - end up exploited in\nillegal cannabis farms and cheap nail bars which have\nproliferated across the country.\n\"It's an extreme tragedy and I think hopefully it will be a\ncatalyst for some sort of change,\" said Philippa Southwell, a\nlawyer with Birds Solicitors who specialises in trafficking.\n\"(We need) tighter regulation in various sectors such as\ncash-in-hand nail bars and car washes where it is easy for\nexploitation to take place,\" she said, adding that nail salons\nwere often used to launder proceeds from criminal activity.\nAlthough many nail bars set up by Britain's Vietnamese\ncommunity are legitimate, experts say traffickers have\npiggy-backed off their success.\nAnti-slavery charity Unseen said labour exploitation at\nbeauty salons was the second biggest concern after carwashes for\ncallers to its hotline last year, with 477 potential victims.\nBritain's anti-slavery chief said on Tuesday that most\nrecommendations made by her office in 2017 on tackling the issue\n- including regulation of nail bars - had not been implemented.\nTrafficking experts said the deaths, which were discovered\non Oct. 23, should be a \"clarion call\" for stronger action to\nprotect trafficking victims and called for tighter controls\nincluding more labour inspections.\nNorthern Irish truck driver Maurice Robinson appeared in\ncourt on Monday accused of manslaughter, money laundering,\nconspiracy to traffic people and conspiracy to assist unlawful\nimmigration.\n\nLOCKED UP\nIn 2017, Britain's former anti-slavery commissioner Kevin\nHyland called for tighter regulation of nail bars in a report on\ncombating trafficking involving Vietnamese nationals.\nOne victim quoted in his report worked seven days a week for\n30 pounds ($40). Another had to give all his money to his\nenslavers who locked him up between shifts.\nHyland said Britain should look at New York which had\nintroduced controls on nail bars.\nHis successor Sara Thornton said the majority of the\nreport's 35 recommendations had not been implemented.\n\"Although we don't yet know the full details of this case,\nit appears to bear the hallmarks of human trafficking,\" she told\nthe Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\"My office will be looking at what more can be done to\nimprove our response to this heinous crime and reviewing the\noutstanding recommendations of this report will be an important\npart of this.\"\nThe interior ministry could not immediately comment.\nThe British Association of Beauty Therapy and Cosmetology\n(BABTAC) said there was an urgent need for regulation, ideally\nby an independent industry body.\nBABTAC, which launched a campaign two years ago with Unseen\nto raise awareness of exploitation in nail bars, said it would\nalso like to see a mandatory code and labour inspections.\nBut others said there was no need for an independent body.\nEmily Kenway, senior adviser for the charity Focus on Labour\nExploitation, called for more investment in labour inspections.\n\"Some people will think we should have a stamp, but it isn't\nthe solution,\" said Kenway. \"We need to fund labour inspection\nproperly and we need to stop criminalising undocumented people.\"\nShe said criminalisation prevented trafficking victims\nseeking help for fear of arrest and deportation - which played\ninto the hands of their exploiters and hampered efforts to\ntackle the issue.\nTell-tale indicators of exploitation in nail bars include\nunfeasibly low prices, workers who appear very young or are\nunwilling to make eye contact, and overbearing managers who\ninsist on taking the money.\nWomen questioned on the streets in London said they were\naware that exploitation was an issue in nail bars.\n\"I always make sure they look happy,\" said banker Sonia\nPatla, 31. \"You notice the ones who aren't happy, who aren't\ntalking. Also if the prices are too cheap it makes you wonder\nwhy they're so cheap.\"\n(Reporting by Emma Batha @emmabatha; Additional reporting by K.\nSophie Will. Editing by Katy Migiro.

        "text": "By K. Sophie Will\nLONDON, Oct 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The discovery\nof 39 bodies in a truck in London last week cast a spotlight on\nthe global trade in human beings and sparked debate about\nBritain's approach to tackling smugglers and traffickers.\nA British court heard on Monday that a global crime ring had\nbeen involved in smuggling the dead - many of whom appear to\nhave come from Vietnam - as the driver of the truck faced\ncharges of manslaughter and human trafficking.\nVietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on Saturday told\nauthorities to establish whether Vietnamese citizens were among\nthe dead, and to probe allegations of trafficking.\nUnlike trafficking, which is control over a person for the\npurpose of exploitation, smuggling is merely illegal entry into\nanother country - although the latter can turn into the former.\nAbout 10% of the suspected 7,000 slavery victims found in\nBritain last year were Vietnamese. Most are trafficked for\nlabour such as cannabis cultivation and work in nail salons.\nGlobally, more than 40 million people are estimated by the\nUnited Nations to be trapped in modern slavery as poverty,\nconflict and climate change fuel the $150-billion-a-year trade.\nThe Thomson Reuters Foundation asked six anti-slavery\nexperts about how to prevent such deaths from happening again.\nSARA THORNTON, BRITAIN'S INDEPENDENT ANTI-SLAVERY COMMISSIONER\n\"This is a shocking illustration of the cruel and complex\nissue that is human trafficking in Britain today.\n\"Whilst we do not yet know the full details of the journeys\nthat these individuals made, this case bears all the hallmarks\nof human trafficking.\n\"As we rethink our migration policies, it is essential that\nthe needs of vulnerable migrants are front and centre.\n\"We need to ensure that new migration policies are\nstress-tested to ensure that they do not provide opportunities\nfor the traffickers to exploit very vulnerable people.\"\nMIMI VU, INDEPENDENT ANTI-TRAFFICKING EXPERT IN VIETNAM\n\"The government and businesses must look at what the root\ncauses are, realising that people that are less educated are\nmore likely to take these risks because they are poor.\n\"All the work on this has to be done before anyone leaves,\nas this all has to be done in-country.\n\"When you address the root causes, you will convince the\nVietnamese that this is not worth the risk.\n\"They have to believe in very concrete meaningful ways that\nthey have a future in Vietnam.\n\"But we are losing our people to trafficking and slavery.\"\nLUCILA GRANADA, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF FOCUS ON LABOUR EXPLOITATION\n\"We must, of course, investigate and punish those who profit\nfrom the desperation of people, but to effectively prevent this\nfrom happening again we must recognise the role of Britain in\ndriving people into these dangerous routes.\n\"It is important to recognise that British immigration\npolicies and border control approach have played a key part in\nrestricting their options.\n\"With no available regular immigration pathways and the\nconstant threat of detention and deportation in transit and upon\narrival, those seeking survival in Britain become easy prey.\n\"This tragedy exposed one more time that prosecuting\nindividual traffickers is not enough. We need to open safe\nroutes of regular migration and end the hostile environment.\"\nJUSTINE CURRELL, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF UNSEEN\n\"Whether people get into the back of a lorry through their\nown volition or from having been forced or coerced, the ultimate\npenalty is death.\n\"Even when trafficking and exploitation is not the primary\nfactor of movement, those entering the country illegally and who\nlack status become increasingly vulnerable and susceptible to\nabuse and exploitation.\n\"Awareness-raising in communities and specific source\ncountries to deter people from putting their lives at risk would\nhelp to highlight the pitfalls of taking this dangerous course\nof action.\n\"Increased targeted checks at the border may also help to\nroot out such movement and any intervention subsequently made\nbefore another disaster occurs.\"\nPHILIPPA SOUTHWELL, LAWYER AT BIRDS SOLICITORS\n\"Solving this is not simple, but obviously it's down to the\nmanning of ports. I know it's difficult to check each vehicle,\nand it really is impossible to do one-to-one checking on these\nvehicles, but we can improve the manning of particular ports.\n\"Particularly in Asia, people living in poverty are promised\na better life and are coming to Britain to work and send money\nback to their families.\n\"We need to be looking to build better relationships with\nthese countries, realising what the root problems are there and\nwhat can be done.\"\nNAZIR AFZAL, FORMER CHIEF PROSECUTOR IN NORTHERN ENGLAND\n\"Human trafficking is organised crime from which criminals\nbenefit.\n\"Demand has to be reduced through deterrence, the closing\ndown of businesses that engage trafficked people.\nSimultaneously, authorities need to follow the money and\nidentify it, confiscate it, whilst punishing the offenders.\n\"Trafficked people need to be seen as victims first and\nlast. They need to be supported to give their best evidence\nagainst the traffickers, not threatened with deportation.\"\n(Reporting by K. Sophie Will, Writing by Kieran Guilbert,\nEditing by Katy Migiro.

        "text": "CAN LOC, Vietnam (Reuters) - Police in Vietnam took hair and blood samples on Sunday to get DNA from relatives of people feared to be among the 39 who died in the back of a truck near London last week, their family members said.\nThe bodies were found on Wednesday in a truck container in Grays, about 32 km (20 miles) east of central London and British police are still trying to establish the identity of victims who in many cases lacked identity documents.\nIn a poor rice-growing area of northern Vietnam, communities have been plunged into mourning with their hope all but lost for relatives who had set out to seek better lives in Europe and were thought to have been aboard the truck.\nThe hashtag #RIP39 was trending in Vietnam on widely-used Facebook.\nDistraught, Nguyen Dinh Gia said he feared there was very little chance he would ever again see his 20-year-old son, Nguyen Dinh Luong, who had been trying to get to Britain after first making it to France.\n\"Police from the Ministry of Public Security came to get DNA samples, our hair and blood,\" Nguyen Dinh Gia told Reuters at Can Loc in Ha Tinh province, where sympathizers gathered at the simple house amid lush rice fields to console the family.\n\"I advised him not to go because I told him that even though our family had always had nothing and our children were always in hardship, but we brought them up just fine,\" Nguyen said.\nThe father of Pham Thi Tra My, who sent a last text message to her family in the early hours of Wednesday Vietnam time, said police had also been to collect samples of blood and hair.\nVietnam's government did not respond immediately for a request for comment. Vietnam's prime minister has called for an investigation into the case.\nPolice in Britain said on Saturday they had charged one man, 25-year-old Maurice Robinson of Craigavon in Northern Ireland, with 39 counts of manslaughter and other offences including conspiracy to traffic people.\nOn Sunday, police said three people arrested in connection with the investigation had been released on bail. All three had been questioned on suspicion of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people.\nInitially, British police believed the victims were Chinese, but later sought help from the Vietnamese community. Chinese and Vietnamese officials were both working closely with British police, the countries' embassies said. \nA Catholic priest in the remote town of Yen Thanh in Nghe An province said on Saturday that he believed most of the dead were likely from Vietnam.\n\nNO DOCUMENTS\nBritish police have said very few of the victims were carrying official identification and that they hope to identify the dead through fingerprints, dental records and DNA, as well as photos from friends and relatives.\nIn the predominantly Catholic area of northern Vietnam from which the suspected victims came, churches held candle-lit prayers at the weekend.\nHow the victims came to be in the truck is not yet known.\nSome 70% of Vietnamese trafficking cases in the United Kingdom between 2009-2016 were for labor exploitation, including cannabis production and work in nail salons, according to a British government report last year.\nThe families of the suspected victims were in Nghe An and Ha Tinh, two of the poorest provinces in communist Vietnam.\nNghe An was identified as home to many victims of human trafficking who end up in Europe, according to a March report by the Pacific Links Foundation, a U.S.-based anti-trafficking organization. \nHa Tinh was ravaged by one of Vietnam's worst environmental disasters in 2016 when a steel mill owned by Taiwan's Formosa Plastics contaminated coastal waters, devastating local fishing and tourism industries.\nIt was from Ha Tinh that Tra My set out, first to China, in the hope of making it to Britain via France. According to Human Rights Space, a civic network based in Vietnam, she sent one final apologetic message home.\n\"I'm sorry, mum and dad. My path abroad was not a success. I love you both so much. I can\u2019t breathe. I'm from Nghen Town, Can Loc District, Ha Tinh, Vietnam ... I am sorry, mum,\" the message said.\n\n (Writing by Matthew Tostevin, editing by Deepa Babington)",

        "text": "YEN THANH, Vietnam (Reuters) - Several townships in rural Vietnam sank into mourning on Saturday, with communities believing that many of the 39 people found dead in the back of a truck near London this week came from poor, rice-growing areas of the country.\nThe bodies were discovered on Wednesday after emergency services were alerted to people in a truck container on an industrial site in Grays, about 32 km (20 miles) east of central London.\nBritish police said on Saturday that they had charged one man, 25-year-old Maurice Robinson of Craigavon in Northern Ireland, with 39 counts of manslaughter and other offences including conspiracy to traffic people.\nPolice initially believed the dead were Chinese, but Beijing said the nationalities had not been confirmed and on Saturday a senior British police officer in charge of identification asked for help from Britain's Vietnamese community.\nChinese and Vietnamese officials are now both working closely with British police, the two countries' embassies have said. Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc ordered government officials to help establish the identities of the victims and look into cases of Vietnamese citizens sent abroad illegally.\nFather Anthony Dang Huu Nam, a Catholic priest in the remote town of Yen Thanh in northern-central Vietnam's Nghe An province, 300 km (180 miles) south of Hanoi, said he believed most of the dead were likely from Vietnam. He told Reuters he was liaising with family members.\n\"The whole district is covered in sorrow,\" Nam said, as prayers for the dead rang out over loudspeakers throughout the misty, rain-soaked town on Saturday. \"This is a catastrophe for our community.\"\nOn Saturday evening, Nam led around 500 worshippers in prayers for the dead as they held lit candles in the modest, white-walled church in Yen Thanh.\n\"We are here to pray for justice and peace, and for the victims of society. We pray for the 39 people who lost their lives on the way to the UK. They are people coming from central Vietnam, our land,\" Nam said.\nNam said families had told him they knew relatives were traveling to Britain at the time the container truck was traveling, and had been unable to contact their loved ones.\nThe British police officer in charge of identifying the victims, Detective Chief Inspector Martin Pasmore, said very few were carrying official identification and that he hoped to identify the dead through fingerprints, dental records and DNA, as well as photos from friends and relatives.\nPolice have found more than 500 items within the truck including bags, clothing and mobile phones that need to be assessed. Once a preliminary identification has been made, liaison officers will be deployed to support families.\nApart from the man charged, who will appear in court on Monday for an initial hearing, three other people are under arrest in Britain on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking. A fourth person is under arrest in Dublin.\n\n'BEAUTIFUL DAY'\nIn Yen Thanh, Nghe An province, dozens of worried relatives of 19-year-old Bui Thi Nhung gathered in the family's small courtyard home where her distraught mother has been unable to rise from her bed.\n\"She said she was in France and on the way to the UK, where she has friends and relatives,\" said Nhung's cousin, Hoang Thi Linh.\n\"We are waiting and hoping it's not her among the victims, but it's very likely. We pray for her every day. There were two people from my village traveling in that group\".\nIn comments under a photo uploaded to Nhung's Facebook account on Monday, two days before the doomed truck was discovered, one friend asked how her journey was going.\n\"Not good,\" Nhung replied. \"Almost spring,\" she said, using a term in Vietnamese meaning she had almost reached her destination.\nOther photos on her account show her sightseeing in Brussels on Oct. 18.\n\"Such a beautiful day,\" Nhung posted.\nAnother person who may have died is Nguyen Dinh Tu, who had been working illegally in Romania, and Germany, where he lost his job. \nA few months ago, he asked his wife Hoang Thi Thuong to help him raise 11,000 pounds ($14,000) to cover the cost of an illicit trip from Germany to the United Kingdom.\n\"I lost contact with him on October 21,\" Thuong told Reuters. \"I have a big debt to pay, no hope, and no energy to do anything\".\nTu's father said relatives in the United Kingdom had told him that Tu was inside the truck, and had been planning to pick him up.\n\"They were supposed to pick him up at the drop-off point but  they called and said Tu was in that truck,\" Tu's father, Nguyen Dinh Sat, told Reuters.\n\"I haven't heard anything from my son\".\n\nPARENTS 'CAN'T BREATHE'\nHow the victims came to be in the truck is not yet known.\nSome 70% of Vietnamese trafficking cases in the United Kingdom between 2009-2016 were for labor exploitation, including cannabis production and work in nail bars, according to a British government report last year.\n\"Women and girls from rural areas are also considered more susceptible to trafficking,\" the report said.\nBritish police sought to reassure anyone living in Britain illegally that they would not be investigated if they came forward to help with the identification. \n\"If you come to us, we will do all we can to put our arm around you and take you through this process, and establish as quickly as possible whether or not we have your loved involved in this tragic incident, and try and reunite you,\" Pasmore said. \nNghe An is one of Vietnam's poorest provinces, and home to many victims of human trafficking who end up in Europe, according to a March report by the Pacific Links Foundation, a U.S.-based anti-trafficking organization. \nOther victims are believed to come from the neighboring province of Ha Tinh, Father Nam said. In the first eight months of this year, 41,790 people left Ha Tinh looking for work elsewhere, including overseas, according to state media.\nThe province was ravaged by one of Vietnam's worst environmental disasters in 2016 when a steel mill owned by Taiwan's Formosa Plastics contaminated coastal waters, devastating local fishing and tourism industries.\nAnother suspected victim from Ha Tinh, 26-year-old Pham Thi Tra My, had sent a text message to her mother saying she could not breathe at about the time the truck container was en route from Belgium to Britain.\n\"That girl who said in her message that she couldn't breathe in the truck? Her parents can't breathe here at home,\" Nam said.   \n\n (Additional reporting by David Milliken and Kate Holton in London; Writing by James Pearson; Editing by Lincoln Feast, Stephen Coates, Frances Kerry and Alex Richardson)",

        "text": "* Whole district 'covered in sorrow' - Catholic priest\n* Families in desperate wait for news of missing loved ones\n* Nghe An province one of Vietnam's poorest\n* 25-year-old charged with manslaughter, trafficking\noffences\n(Adds details from British police)\nYEN THANH, Vietnam, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Several townships in\nrural Vietnam sank into mourning on Saturday, with communities\nbelieving that many of the 39 people found dead in the back of a\ntruck near London this week came from poor, rice-growing areas\nof the country.\nThe bodies were discovered on Wednesday after emergency\nservices were alerted to people in a truck container on an\nindustrial site in Grays, about 32 km (20 miles) east of central\nLondon.\nBritish police said on Saturday that they had charged one\nman, 25-year-old Maurice Robinson of Craigavon in Northern\nIreland, with 39 counts of manslaughter and other offences\nincluding conspiracy to traffic people.\nPolice initially believed the dead were Chinese, but Beijing\nsaid the nationalities had not been confirmed and on Saturday a\nsenior British police officer in charge of identification asked\nfor help from Britain's Vietnamese community.\nChinese and Vietnamese officials are now both working\nclosely with British police, the two countries' embassies have\nsaid. Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc ordered\ngovernment officials to help establish the identities of the\nvictims and look into cases of Vietnamese citizens sent abroad\nillegally.\nFather Anthony Dang Huu Nam, a Catholic priest in the remote\ntown of Yen Thanh in northern-central Vietnam's Nghe An\nprovince, 300 km (180 miles) south of Hanoi, said he believed\nmost of the dead were likely from Vietnam. He told Reuters he\nwas liaising with family members.\n\"The whole district is covered in sorrow,\" Nam said, as\nprayers for the dead rang out over loudspeakers throughout the\nmisty, rain-soaked town on Saturday. \"This is a catastrophe for\nour community.\"\nOn Saturday evening, Nam led around 500 worshippers in\nprayers for the dead as they held lit candles in the modest,\nwhite-walled church in Yen Thanh.\n\"We are here to pray for justice and peace, and for the\nvictims of society. We pray for the 39 people who lost their\nlives on the way to the UK. They are people coming from central\nVietnam, our land,\" Nam said.\nNam said families had told him they knew relatives were\ntravelling to Britain at the time the container truck was\ntravelling, and had been unable to contact their loved ones.\nThe British police officer in charge of identifying the\nvictims, Detective Chief Inspector Martin Pasmore, said very few\nwere carrying official identification and that he hoped to\nidentify the dead through fingerprints, dental records and DNA,\nas well as photos from friends and relatives.\nPolice have found more than 500 items within the truck\nincluding bags, clothing and mobile phones that need to be\nassessed. Once a preliminary identification has been made,\nliaison officers will be deployed to support families.\nApart from the man charged, who will appear in court on\nMonday for an initial hearing, three other people are under\narrest in Britain on suspicion of manslaughter and human\ntrafficking. A fourth person is under arrest in Dublin.\n\n'BEAUTIFUL DAY'\nIn Yen Thanh, Nghe An province, dozens of worried relatives\nof 19-year-old Bui Thi Nhung gathered in the family's small\ncourtyard home where her distraught mother has been unable to\nrise from her bed.\n\"She said she was in France and on the way to the UK, where\nshe has friends and relatives,\" said Nhung's cousin, Hoang Thi\nLinh.\n\"We are waiting and hoping it's not her among the victims,\nbut it's very likely. We pray for her every day. There were two\npeople from my village travelling in that group\".\nIn comments under a photo uploaded to Nhung's Facebook\naccount on Monday, two days before the doomed truck was\ndiscovered, one friend asked how her journey was going.\n\"Not good,\" Nhung replied. \"Almost spring,\" she said, using\na term in Vietnamese meaning she had almost reached her\ndestination.\nOther photos on her account show her sightseeing in Brussels\non Oct. 18.\n\"Such a beautiful day,\" Nhung posted.\nAnother person who may have died is Nguyen Dinh Tu, who had\nbeen working illegally in Romania, and Germany, where he lost\nhis job.\nA few months ago, he asked his wife Hoang Thi Thuong to help\nhim raise 11,000 pounds ($14,000) to cover the cost of an\nillicit trip from Germany to the United Kingdom.\n\"I lost contact with him on October 21,\" Thuong told\nReuters. \"I have a big debt to pay, no hope, and no energy to do\nanything\".\nTu's father said relatives in the United Kingdom had told\nhim that Tu was inside the truck, and had been planning to pick\nhim up.\n\"They were supposed to pick him up at the drop-off point but\nthey called and said Tu was in that truck,\" Tu's father, Nguyen\nDinh Sat, told Reuters.\n\"I haven't heard anything from my son\".\n\nPARENTS 'CAN'T BREATHE'\nHow the victims came to be in the truck is not yet known.\nSome 70% of Vietnamese trafficking cases in the United\nKingdom between 2009-2016 were for labour exploitation,\nincluding cannabis production and work in nail bars, according\nto a British government report last year.\n\"Women and girls from rural areas are also considered more\nsusceptible to trafficking,\" the report said.\nBritish police sought to reassure anyone living in Britain\nillegally that they would not be investigated if they came\nforward to help with the identification.\n\"If you come to us, we will do all we can to put our arm\naround you and take you through this process, and establish as\nquickly as possible whether or not we have your loved involved\nin this tragic incident, and try and reunite you,\" Pasmore said.\nNghe An is one of Vietnam's poorest provinces, and home to\nmany victims of human trafficking who end up in Europe,\naccording to a March report by the Pacific Links Foundation, a\nU.S.-based anti-trafficking organisation.\nOther victims are believed to come from the neighbouring\nprovince of Ha Tinh, Father Nam said. In the first eight months\nof this year, 41,790 people left Ha Tinh looking for work\nelsewhere, including overseas, according to state media.\nThe province was ravaged by one of Vietnam's worst\nenvironmental disasters in 2016 when a steel mill owned by\nTaiwan's Formosa Plastics contaminated coastal waters,\ndevastating local fishing and tourism industries.\nAnother suspected victim from Ha Tinh, 26-year-old Pham Thi\nTra My, had sent a text message to her mother saying she could\nnot breathe at about the time the truck container was en route\nfrom Belgium to Britain.\n\"That girl who said in her message that she couldn't breathe\nin the truck? Her parents can't breathe here at home,\" Nam said.\n($1 = 0.7800 pounds)\n(Additional reporting by David Milliken and Kate Holton in\nLondon; Writing by James Pearson; Editing by Lincoln Feast,\nStephen Coates, Frances Kerry and Alex Richardson)",

        "text": "By Rina Chandran\nPENANG, Malaysia, Oct 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -\nU rban planners in rapidly expanding Asian cities must involve\nthe poorest residents in decision-making and include informal\nspaces if they are serious about tackling inequality,\ndevelopment experts said on Wednesday.\nMore than 2.3 billion people in Asia-Pacific live in cities,\nand that number is expected to reach nearly 3.5 billion in 2050,\naccording to the United Nations.\nBut one-third of urban dwellers live in slums or slum-like\nconditions and are under constant threat of eviction as planners\nand authorities look to modernise cities, said Elisa Sutanudjaja\nat the Rujak Center for Urban Studies, a Jakarta think tank.\n\"Cities in Asia are largely a mix of formality and\ninformality, but urban planning is never neutral: it's all\nformal vs informal, legal vs illegal,\" she said on the sidelines\nof a U.N. urban conference in Penang.\n\"But the right to city is far more than individual liberty\nto access urban resources and livelihoods; it is also about\ninformality and community.\"\nThis year, a majority of Asia-Pacific's population for the\nfirst time became urban, with more than half the population\nliving in cities, according to a U.N. report published earlier\nthis week.\nWith growing pressure on resources such as land and water,\nthe region is struggling to make \"effective planning systems a\ncornerstone of national policy\", said Maimunah Mohd Sharif,\nexecutive director of UN-Habitat, the human settlements agency.\nCities in the region that are ranked high for liveability,\nincluding Singapore, and those in Australia, Japan and South\nKorea have co-produced solutions with citizens, she said.\n\"Bridging the digital divide, engaging the urban poor, and\nbuilding climate resilience must be a priority. We have to\nensure equitable distribution of resources,\" said Sharif, a\nformer town planner and mayor of Penang island, off Malaysia's\nwest coast.\nBut increasingly, planners are ignoring the poorest and most\nvulnerable residents including slum dwellers and street vendors,\nsaid Renu Khosla, director of the Centre for Urban & Regional\nExcellence in New Delhi.\n\"Our cities are not being planned for the poor. But when\ncities are planned without people in mind, you get more informal\nsettlements, you get more inequality,\" she told the Thomson\nReuters Foundation.\n\"Perhaps it's time to move away from territorial and\nland-based planning, and plan around people and their needs.\"\nFrom Bangkok to Manila, as Asian cities strive to become\nmore modern, street vendors and hawkers are viewed increasingly\nas a hindrance to city planning and are being evicted from\npavements.\nBut public spaces are for the good of all members of the\npublic and must be legally available to everyone, said\nChidchanok Samantrakul at WIEGO, a global non-profit that helps\ninformal workers.\n\"Half the city is informal - informal settlers, street\nvendors - yet planners only focus on the formal. But there has\nto be opportunity for everyone to co-exist,\" she said.\nSeveral cities in the region are now using Minecraft, a\nvideo game that allows players to build their own worlds using\nvirtual Lego-like pieces, to get communities to participate in\nupgrading their common spaces, under a UN-Habitat programme.\nIn the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi, where women and girls\noften face harassment on the streets and on public transport,\nMinecraft was used to identify safety issues and make public\nspaces safer, said Thu Dao Thi Bao of non-profit Plan\nInternational.\n\"Technology helps give girls and women a voice. We have to\nencourage their participation in city planning and management.\"\n(Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Michael\nTaylor.

        "text": "By Emma Batha\nLONDON, Oct 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When a\nchildren's hospital in Aleppo was decimated in 2016 after\nmultiple bombings, British-Syrian doctor Rola Hallam decided to\nturn her grief into action.\nWithin weeks the London consultant anaesthetist was on the\nway to the Syrian border with enough equipment to build the\nworld's first crowdfunded hospital.\n\"Thousands of people from around the world came together to\nraise the money we needed,\" said Hallam, who won the Women of\nthe Year lifetime achievement award in London on Monday.\n\"The Syrian doctors and nurses were blown away. For the\nfirst time they felt heard and seen by people around the world.\nIt gave them so much hope that they named it Hope Hospital.\"\nThe hospital, which has since treated 200,000 children, is\nsupported by CanDo, a social enterprise Hallam set up to help\nlocal humanitarians in warzones crowdfund lifesaving work that\nlarger aid organisations often cannot do.\n\"In Syria, I've really seen the absolute worst of humanity,\nbut I've also seen the very best,\" Hallam told the Thomson\nReuters Foundation at the award ceremony.\n\"The remarkable doctors and nurses that I've had the honour\nand privilege to work with inspire me and motivate me every\nsingle day.\"\nHallam, 40, who moved to Britain as a teenager after growing\nup in Damascus, said the idea for CanDo was born in 2013 when\nshe was working in a Syrian field hospital in rural Aleppo.\nShe was among medics who treated children for horrific burns\nafter a schoolyard was bombed.\nIt was a heartbreaking day made even worse because Hallam\ndid not have all the equipment, medicines and resources she\nneeded to help the children.\n\"I should have been able to give them sedation and pain\nkillers, put a breathing tube in ... Instead, I had to send them\nsuffocating and in pain to Turkey,\" she said.\n\n\"BEYOND BURNT-OUT\"\nAlthough Syrian non-governmental organisations carry out 75%\nof humanitarian work they receive less than 1% of aid funds for\nthe country, Hallam said, a pattern also seen in other warzones.\nAt the same time Hallam said there is growing public\ndisillusionment with some bigger charities, with many people\nwanting to know exactly how and where their donations go.\nNot only are local humanitarians first on the scene, but\nthey can reach communities cut off from other aid and remain\nafter other agencies have pulled out. They also share the same\nculture and language as the people they are helping.\nHallam said CanDo had raised 1.3 million pounds ($1.6\nmillion) since 2017 for projects that have helped 500,000\npeople. It wants to expand to Yemen, South Sudan and Myanmar.\nIn Syria, Hallam would like to see mental health support and\nrest breaks for the \"heroes\" on the frontline.\n\"International aid workers get rest and recuperation. Local\naid workers do not get any of that. They are beyond burnt-out.\nImagine, eight years of this hell,\" she said.\nHallam said attacks on Syria's health services were used as\na weapon of war and were \"crimes against humanity\".\nShe said there had been more than 500 attacks on hospitals,\n90% by Syrian forces and their allies, and more than 800 of her\ncolleagues had been killed, many under torture.\n\"This is premeditated destruction ... in order to terrorise\na civilian population into submission,\" she said.\nBut she warned that the destruction of Syria's health\ninfrastructure also had global repercussions - fuelling the\nrefugee crisis and raising the risks that Syria will be the\nsource of the next Ebola-scale health emergency.\n\"If we don't rebuild Syria's healthcare system we are going\nto be the next exporter of these global diseases,\" she said.\n(1 = 0.7960 pounds)\n(Reporting by Emma Batha @emmabatha; Editing by Belinda\nGoldsmith\nPlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm\nof Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's and\nLGBT+ rights, human trafficking, property rights, and climate\nchange.
