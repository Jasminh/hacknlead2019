""The Vietnamese embassy in Britain was informed by Essex police that there are Vietnamese citizens, unidentified, among 39 victims in the lorry incident,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said in a statement posted on its website. ""Vietnam strongly condemns human trafficking and considers it a serious crime; traffickers must be strictly dealt with,"" Hang said in the Saturday statement. British police said on Friday they now believe all 39 people found dead in the back of a truck in Essex near London on Oct.23 were Vietnamese. Police in Vietnam arrested two people and summoned others for questioning on Friday on suspicion of involvement in the truck deaths. Hang said in the statement that Vietnam was working closely with British police to verify victims' identities and called on other countries to cooperate in combating human trafficking crimes. ""This is a humanitarian tragedy,"" Hang said. ""We are deeply saddened and we would like to share our deepest condolences to the families of the victims and wish them to overcome this great pain and loss soon.""

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L8N27H5Q0	SAO PAULO, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Brazilian federal police said they have arrested Saifullah Al-Mamun, born in Bangladesh and considered by authorities one of the world's most prolific human traffickers. In an operation conducted on Thursday after collaboration with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Brazilian police arrested members of a group allegedly implicated in a large scheme of smuggling people into the United States. Several arrests were made in Sao Paulo, where Al-Mamun was living, and in three other Brazilian cities. The police also froze 42 bank accounts it says were used by the group to finance their activities. Al-Mamun entered Brazil six years ago as a refugee, and was living in Bras, a diverse neighborhood in Sao Paulo that is home to immigrants from around the world. He has been indicted on U.S. charges. According to the United States Department of Justice, Al-Mamun is alleged to have housed people coming from Southeast Asia in São Paulo and arranged for their travel through a network of smugglers operating in Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico. According to Brazilian police, he and his group were smuggling into Brazil, and then to the United States, people from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. They were sent to Brazil's northern Acre state to start a long and dangerous trip through Central America all the way to the Mexican border, to cross into the United States. Reuters was not able to confirm whether Al-Mamun had a lawyer in Sao Paulo who could be contacted for comment. Brazilian police said the group charged people coming from Asia around 50,000 reais ($12,524) for the attempt to reach the United States. Some would also stay illegally in Brazil, where they were given fraudulent documentation. Police said people suffered violence while waiting in Sao Paulo to start the trip north. It said a group of eight Bengali people fell into the hands of a Mexican drug cartel while traveling toward the Mexico-U.S. border.

In Vietnam, police said they had detained two people.  The discovery of the bodies in a container on an industrial estate has shone a spotlight on the illicit trade that sends the poor of Asia, Africa and the Middle East on perilous journeys to the West. The alleged truck driver has already been charged over the deaths, and on Friday detectives said Eamon Harrison, 23, from Northern Ireland, was also accused of 39 counts of manslaughter as well as human trafficking and immigration offences. Harrison appeared at Dublin's High Court at the start of proceedings to extradite him from Ireland to Britain. He was remanded in custody until Nov. 11, a court spokesman said. The bodies were found in the early hours of Oct. 23 after the container arrived in Britain from Zeebrugge in Belgium. The container was picked up at Purfleet dock in Essex, east of London, by a truck allegedly driven by Maurice Robinson, 25, from Northern Ireland. The victims were found not long afterwards. Police have not confirmed the exact cause of their deaths. They initially said the victims were thought to be Chinese, but on Friday evening they said they were now all believed to Vietnamese. ""We are in direct contact with a number of families in Vietnam and the UK, and we believe we have identified families for some of the victims,"" Essex police Assistant Chief Constable Tim Smith said on Twitter.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L8N27H0YP	"* Hezbollah urges forming new cabinet quickly * Massive protests pushed PM Hariri to resign * Queues build at banks, no panic after two-week closure * Customers encounter curbs on dollar transfers, withdrawals * Lebanese pound strengthens against dollar on black market (Adds analyst, details, reinstates earlier reporting on banks) By Tom Perry and Ellen Francis BEIRUT, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The powerful Lebanese Hezbollah group said on Friday a new government must listen to the demands that fuelled protests against the country's rulers and led Saad al-Hariri to quit as prime minister this week. The unprecedented, nationwide protests that erupted on Oct. 17 tipped Lebanon into political turmoil as it grapples with the worst economic crisis since the 1975-90 civil war. Lebanese banks reopened for the first time in two weeks on Friday, with dozens of people waiting at some branches. Customers encountered new curbs on transfers abroad and withdrawals from U.S. dollar accounts, though there were no formal capital controls, bankers and customers said. The Lebanese pound strengthened against the dollar on a parallel market that has emerged in recent months, three dealers said. Hariri, an ally of the West, quit on Tuesday after saying he had failed to resolve the crisis unleashed by the protests against a ruling elite accused of rampant corruption and steering Lebanon to economic collapse. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, a political adversary of Hariri, has opposed his decision, saying it would waste time needed to enact reforms that are urgently needed to plug gaping holes in the state finances. ""A new government must be formed as soon as possible ... and the new government must listen to the demands of the people who took to the streets,"" Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised address. ""There must be serious work because time is tight and so is people's patience,"" he said, adding that the government's goal must be to restore confidence. After warning last week against a power vacuum that could lead to chaos and even civil war, Nasrallah said on Friday the ""patience and awareness"" of the Lebanese had averted such scenarios.  FOREIGN FOES Supporters of Hezbollah and its Shi'ite ally Amal attacked and destroyed a protest camp in central Beirut on Tuesday, days after Nasrallah had suggested that foreign foes were exploiting the protests. President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, has yet to say when he will begin consultations with MPs to pick a new prime minister. Hariri's government continues in a caretaker capacity in the meantime. A Maronite Christian, Aoun signalled support for a new government of technocrats in a speech on Thursday, which would satisfy another of the protesters' demands. Nadim Houry, executive director of the Arab Reform Initiative, said Nasrallah's speech was less accusatory than the last one and indicated a deescalation. Taken together with Aoun's speech, it appeared to suggest a change of course by Hezbollah and its Christian ally. ""There is a direction that says we are going to present ourselves as listening to popular demands,"" he said. ""Are they going to truly support what they are saying - a government that can get to work with credibility on the street?"" Lebanon's economy has been hit by years of regional turmoil and a slowdown in capital flows to the country that has put its foreign currency reserves under pressure. Banks told customers they could only transfer funds abroad in particular circumstances such repaying loans, education, health, family support or commercial commitments. An hour after doors opened, dozens people of people were waiting at some banks in Beirut and other cities, Reuters witnesses said. At others, fewer were waiting. The central bank had promised not to impose capital controls when banks re-opened, measures that could hamper the currency inflows and investment that Lebanon badly needs. Asked about steps being taken by banks, Salim Sfeir, head of the Association of Banks in Lebanon, said: ""I would not call it restrictions but rather efforts by the banks to accommodate all customers, given the pressure resulting from closing for two weeks."" ""We stand ready to adjust any measure taken, once the situation in the country is back to normal"", he told Reuters.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N27G4K4	BANGKOK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - A Thai court of appeal has increased prison time for a former army general and more than fifty others convicted in the country's largest human trafficking trial. The case, which involved 103 defendants, began in 2015 after a crackdown following the gruesome discovery of dozens of shallow graves in jungle camps near the Thai-Malaysian border. Traffickers had been using the camps to hold mostly Rohingya Muslim migrants hostage until their relatives were able to pay for their release, authorities said. In 2017, a criminal court sentenced 62 defendants on 13 different charges, including trafficking in persons, smuggling illegal migrants into the country and organised crime. The appeals court late on Thursday dismissed convictions for two defendants while increasing the jail terms for 55 others with additional charges of smuggling illegal migrants. Some of these were also given additional prison time for multiple human trafficking charges. Those receiving longer sentences include former army Lieutenant General Manas Kongpan, who saw his 27-year prison term for trafficking and corruption increased to 82 years. Banjong Pongphol, an ex-mayor of Padang Besar in Songkhla province, saw his prison sentence increased to 79 years from 78. The court also upheld the harshest sentence of 94 years for Soe Naing, a Rohingya man who the authorities said is a key figure behind the trafficking network. He was found guilty of assault causing death and human trafficking. The state prosecutor or the defendants can still lodge an appeal against the verdict within 30 days. A further appeal would push the case to the Supreme Court, the final court in the Thai justice system. Myanmar regards Rohingya as illegal migrants from the Indian subcontinent and has confined tens of thousands to sprawling camps in Rakhine state since violence swept the area in 2012. The unrest prompted tens of thousands of Rohingya to flee Myanmar by sea. This exodus by boat peaked in 2015, when an estimated 25,000 people crossed the Andaman Sea for Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, many drowning as unsafe and overloaded boats capsized. When violence broke out again in Rakhine state in 2017, more than 700,000 Rohingya crossed into Bangladesh fleeing an army crackdown, according to U.N. agencies.

The coalition of palm oil producers and buyers will contribute nearly $1.3 million to the project - led by the U.S.-based World Resources Institute (WRI) - which will keep a watch on forests using data from European Space Agency satellites. ""The new technology on one side and the fact that we have all of these big actors in the room coming together to think about how we can best use the information ... is really what needs to happen,"" said Anne Rosenbarger, Southeast Asia commodities manager at WRI in Indonesia. Palm oil, the world's most widely used edible oil, is found in everything from margarine to biscuits, and soap to soups. But the $60-billion global trade has faced scrutiny in recent years from green activists and consumers, who have blamed its production for forest loss, fires and worker exploitation. The world's top two producers and exporters are Indonesia and Malaysia, and the new radar-based system will cover both. WRI said it would be up and running within two years and could eventually be expanded into other grower countries. The system will use higher resolution images than existing monitoring initiatives, cover a wider area and penetrate cloud cover. Its data will also be made publicly available through online monitoring service Global Forest Watch. Rosenbarger told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the ability to gather 10 major market players to work with the new platform ""has a lot of potential for impact"". ""The main thing was how we can get more reliable information quicker to help have faster follow-up on the ground so we can intervene where deforestation is happening,"" she added. The online platform will highlight patches in concessions and protected areas suffering tree loss and deforestation. As well as alerting companies to where action is needed, governments and conservation groups can also use the information to hold businesses linked to those areas accountable. The palm oil and consumer goods firms in the project - which are already receiving alerts and giving feedback - are Bunge, Cargill, Golden Agri-Resources, Mondelez, Musim Mas Group, Nestle, PepsiCo, Sime Darby Plantation, Unilever and Wilmar. Many high-profile palm oil buyers have committed to zero deforestation and to source only sustainable oil by 2020, although some are likely to miss their targets. ""We are committed to developing a range of technologies that will enhance and accelerate our efforts to address potential issues within our supply chain,"" Petra Meekers, head of sustainable sourcing at Unilever, said in a statement. ""Better radar monitoring is an essential piece of this puzzle."" (Reporting by Michael Taylor @MickSTaylor; editing by Megan Rowling.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N27G4UW	"(Adds detail on type of users affected) By Sankalp Phartiyal and Sudarshan Varadhan NEW DELHI, Nov 1 (Reuters) - India, WhatsApp's biggest market with 400 million users, has asked the Facebook-owned company to explain the nature of a privacy breach on its messaging platform that has affected some users, Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said. ""We have asked WhatsApp to explain the kind of breach and what it is doing to safeguard the privacy of millions of Indian citizens,"" Prasad said in a tweet on Thursday. The surveillance revelations come after the messaging platform sued Israeli surveillance firm NSO Group on Tuesday, accusing it of helping government spies break into the phones of roughly 1,400 users across four continents including diplomats, political dissidents, journalists and government officials. NSO denied the allegations. In its lawsuit filed in a federal court in San Francisco, WhatsApp accused NSO of facilitating government hacking sprees in 20 countries, calling it ""an unmistakable pattern of abuse."" The attack, according to WhatsApp, exploited its video calling system in order to send malware to the mobile devices of a number of users. The malware would allow NSO's clients - said to be governments and intelligence organisations - to secretly spy on a phone's owner, opening their digital lives up to scrutiny. People familiar with WhatsApp's investigation told Reuters that a significant number of Indian civil society figures were put under surveillance using the Israeli spyware. The company has not identified anyone by name, users including Indian lawyers, academics, Dalit rights activists and journalists have come forward to say they received warnings from WhatsApp that they were the targets of espionage. WhatsApp said Indian users were among those contacted by it this week. WhatsApp declined to comment on Prasad's tweet, but referred to a previous statement from the company which said it believes people have the fundamental right to privacy and no one else should have access to their private conversations. Sidhant Sibal, a New Delhi-based journalist, told Reuters the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab - which investigates digital espionage among other research projects - called him about a month ago, informing him that his WhatsApp account was one of several under surveillance. He received a text message from WhatsApp this week saying it cared about ""your privacy and security"". ""In May we stopped an attack where an advanced cyber actor exploited our video calling to install malware on user devices,"" the company said, explaining why it was writing to Sibal and other affected users like him. ""There's a possibility this phone number was impacted, and we want to make sure you know how to keep your mobile phone secure,"" he said. Citizen Lab in a post on its website dated Oct. 29 said it was helping WhatsApp investigate the incident and would continue to contact affected individuals to help protect their security. Last year the Indian government began pushing the Cupertino, California-based company to trace the origin of some messages, saying the platform was being used to spread misinformation. WhatsApp has always maintained it will not take such steps, which would require it to weaken encryption and other privacy protections. Globally, the platform is used by some 1.5 billion people monthly and has often touted a high level of security, including end-to-end encrypted messages that cannot be deciphered by WhatsApp or other third parties.

Many of the nations are U.S. allies, they said. The hacking of a wider group of top government officials' smartphones than previously reported suggests the WhatsApp cyber intrusion could have broad political and diplomatic consequences. WhatsApp filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against Israeli hacking tool developer NSO Group.

The total number of WhatsApp users hacked could be even higher. A London-based human rights lawyer, who was among the targets, sent Reuters photographs showing attempts to break into his phone dating back to April 1. While it is not clear who used the software to hack officials' phones, NSO has said it sells its spyware exclusively to government customers.  Some victims are in the United States, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Mexico, Pakistan and India, said people familiar with the investigation. Reuters could not verify whether the government officials were from those countries or elsewhere.      Some Indian nationals have gone public with allegations  they were among the targets over the past couple of days; they include journalists, academics, lawyers and defenders of India's Dalit community. NSO said in a statement that it was ""not able to disclose who is or is not a client or discuss specific uses of its technology."" Previously it has denied any wrongdoing, saying its products are only meant to help governments catch terrorists and criminals.  Cybersecurity researchers have cast doubt on those claims over the years, saying NSO products were used against a wide range of targets, including protesters in countries under authoritarian rule.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N27G291	"By Michael Taylor KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 31 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The amount of planet-warming carbon emitted by the world's lost tropical forests has been under-reported as estimates failed to take into account the longer-term effects of tree destruction, researchers said. A new international study re-evaluated the carbon impacts of forests that were destroyed or degraded between 2000 and 2013, adding up to 49 million hectares (121 million acres), roughly the size of Spain. The carbon released from losses to those ""intact forests"" will amount to more than six times previous estimates when additional emissions caused by changes to the forest up to 2050 are included, it found. Intact forests are large areas of continuous forest with no signs of intensive human activity, like agriculture or logging. ""Once you've caused the initial round of damage, you have committed to a lot of further emissions in the future once the forest has opened up,"" said study co-author Tom Evans of the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). ""It's a bit like if you're injured at work you have lost earnings for years into the future,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""Those carbon lost earnings turn out to be the biggest part of the picture for these intact forests."" Trees suck carbon dioxide from the air, and store carbon, the main greenhouse gas heating up the Earth's climate. But they release it when they are cut down and are burned or rot. Environmentalists say protecting existing forests and restoring damaged ones prevents flooding, limits climate change and protects biodiversity. The tropics lost 12 million hectares of tree cover in 2018, the fourth-highest annual loss since records began in 2001, according to forest monitoring service Global Forest Watch. Of greatest concern, it said, was the disappearance of 3.6 million hectares of old-growth rainforest, an area the size of Belgium, much due to fires, land-clearing for farms and mining. Areas analysed in the new study, published in the journal Science Advances, included intact forests lost in the Amazon and Congo basins and on Southeast Asia's islands. While previous research largely focused on stored carbon losses directly linked to deforestation, the new study also took into account the knock-on and future effects. Those include indiscriminate logging around newly opened up forest areas as they become more accessible and a rise in hunting that limits the spread of seeds and hinders forest regeneration. Over time, the carbon-storing abilities of the new forest edges created by deforestation also decline as human and grazing activities increase and temperatures change. ""Once you open up a forest, there are several forms of damage that lead to that dwindling of carbon stocks,"" said Evans, adding that undamaged forests also become more carbon-rich each year. These effects tend to get overlooked in carbon accounting used to work out how and where to target conservation incentives and provide payments for preventing forest loss, he added. In 2013, the world had about 549 million hectares of intact tropical forests left, the study said. Ensuring their future should now be a priority, with increased efforts and policies to keep them safe, Evans said. That should include better recognition of indigenous land rights and a halt to the expansion of mining, fossil fuel extraction, agriculture and infrastructure which often drives forest loss, he added. ""Our results revealed that continued destruction of intact tropical forests is a ticking time bomb for carbon emissions,"" the study's lead author Sean Maxwell, a scientist with Australia's University of Queensland, said in a statement. ""There is an urgent need to safeguard these landscapes because they play an indispensable role in stabilising the climate."" (Reporting by Michael Taylor @MickSTaylor; editing by Megan Rowling.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L8N27E30I	"By Umberto Bacchi TBILISI, Oct 31 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A critical shortage of affordable housing in cities across the world has forced many people to tap such unexpected resources as shipping containers and concrete pipes just to put a roof over their head. At least 150 million people, about 2% of the global population, are homeless according to United Nations data while more than 20% of the population lack adequate housing. Many live in cities. As the U.N. marks World Cities Day on Thursday, here are eight dwelling types which highlight how cities are coping with housing crises:  CAGE HOMES Hong Kong's property prices have rocketed over 200% in the past decade driven by limited housing supply and large capital flows from mainland Chinese buyers, forcing some of the city's poorest to live in often squalid conditions. Tens of thousands are crammed into rooftop shanties, so-called cage homes with plywood bunk beds, or into tiny partitioned flats averaging just 62 sq ft (6 sq m).  SLEEPING PODS As rising prices push city workers to live further from the centre and endure long commutes, sleep pods which allow for a power nap near the office have popped up from Madrid and London to New York. In the British capital, start-up Pop & Rest offers busy travellers, flagging party-goers and restless new parents a bed in a tiny dark room scented with lavender and outfitted with ear plugs and eye masks for less than 20 pounds ($26) an hour.  GARDEN HOMES As part of a project to help refugees find homes in France, local non-profit Quatorze has installed tiny wooden houses insulated with cardboard in some Paris backyards. The first was set up in a family's garden in the eastern suburb of Montreuil in 2017, with an Afghan refugee as its tenant. A second was installed at the back of an art gallery in the same district earlier this year.  GRANNY FLATS A growing number of homeowners in the U.S. capital of Washington - among the country's most expensive cities - have turned townhouse basements or garages into small living units to rent out, often to help cover mortgage costs. Known as granny flats, mother-in-law suites or English basements, these conversions are gaining in popularity across the U.S. as a way to boost affordable housing, according to property experts.  LIVE-IN GUARDIANS Up to 7,000 people are serving as guardians in empty properties across Britain, mainly in London, according to a 2018 report by the London Assembly, an elected body that scrutinizes the activities of the mayor. Guardians pay low rents in exchange for securing buildings from squatters and vandals, but sometimes live in poorly maintained mouldy homes with few legal protections, the report said.  SHIPPING CONTAINERS Thousands of homeless children in Britain are being forced to sleep in often overcrowded converted shipping containers that are ""blisteringly hot"" in summer and ""freezing"" in winter, a report by Children's Commissioner for England said in August.  EGG HOUSE A Chinese man named Dai Haifei made international headlines in 2010 when, unable to afford Beijing's high rental prices, he lived for a few months in an homemade egg-shaped mobile house near his office in the city. The house was made of bamboo strips, steel bars, heat prevention and waterproof materials, sacks filled with fermented wood chips and grass seeds, as well as one solar panel, local media reported.  WATER PIPES To ease Hong Kong's housing crisis, a local architectural firm created micro homes in concrete water pipes that can be stacked under elevated roadways or between highrises. Measuring 2.5 metres (8 feet) in diameter, the pipes have been remade into 100 sq ft (9 sq m) apartments for two, with a living and kitchen space, a shower and a toilet.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L8N27E22N	"By Nanchanok Wongsamuth BANGKOK, Oct 31 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Thai chef Surasit Buttama spent almost a decade cooking international food at upscale restaurants and hotels in the United States and Thailand, but he found his passion a few months ago at a Bangkok restaurant serving edible insects. His latest recipe consists of almond cream pear tart served with silk worm vanilla icecream. While the icecream has two silk worms lying on top, you wouldn't realise that the icecream itself is made of powdered silk worms. The same goes with pasta made of crickets and giant water beetles or crickets mixed into brownies. A dish consisting of grilled seabass is served with crispy ants and ant eggs mixed with beurre blanc sauce. ""One of the challenges that I enjoy is how to make people not feel scared of the food,"" Buttama told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at Insects in the Backyard, Thailand's first edible insect fine dining restaurant, where he is chef de cuisine. ""I don't think I'll ever get bored (with cooking insects), which is something I won't be able to learn anywhere else."" Nutritionists and scientists have been touting insects as sustainable and cheap source of protein to feed a growing world because they are high in protein, vitamins, fibre and minerals. Insects emit fewer greenhouse gases and less ammonia than cattle or pigs and require significantly less land and water than cattle, according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization. While eating insects is already part of a normal diet for Thai people in rural areas, 35-year-old Buttama says it is often looked down upon. Thais account of only 20% of the restaurant's customers. ""Thais associate eating insects with poor people, which is a misunderstanding. (People who live in rural areas) are actually lucky to have different sources of food,"" he said. ""The taste (of insects) is unique and tasty, similar to crab and shrimp. For instance, giant water beetles taste like crab, while grasshoppers taste like shrimp."" Buttama joined Insects in the Backyard about six months ago, which was founded by Somchai Songwattana, chief executive of Flynow, one of Thailand's pioneering fashion brands. ""What we are trying to do is to let Thais know that insects are edible and have value, but they are often overlooked,"" said Buttama. The chef is often seen hanging around in the dining room talking to customers and recommending dishes - his favourite is nachos with cherry tomato salsa, dukkha sour cream, grand padano cheese and your choice of organic insects. He also likes to give tips to customers on how to cook their own meals at home, and plans to write a book on insect cuisine. Edible insects are slowly gaining popularity in Thailand, with packaged snacks sold in 7-Eleven convenience stores and insects sold in bulk at Makro, a local wholesale supermarket. ""I like to encourage people to cook their own dishes because it helps farmers and it's doing good for the world,"" said Buttama. ""In the future, it might even be common for us to see chefs cooking insects in restaurants."" (Reporting by Nanchanok Wongsamuth @nanchanokw; Editing by Katy Migiro.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L8N24A00L	"By Beh Lih Yi LEMBAR, Indonesia, Oct 31 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - F ifteen minutes into their first date, Indonesian teenager Helma Yani received a marriage proposal from a boy she had just met. He spirited her away to a relative's house and a month later, at age 17, they were married. Yani is one of nearly 1.5 million child brides in Muslim-majority Indonesia, which has the world's eighth-highest number of underage unions according to the United Nations. The government raised the marriage age for girls from 16 to 19 in September, but rights groups fear deep-rooted traditions and the practice of not registering unions could hamper efforts to end the scourge. On Yani's island of Lombok, the Sasak people continue a centuries-old tradition of ""bride kidnapping"", in which a woman is taken away by her future husband before a wedding. Known locally as ""merariq"", Sasak elders say the kidnapping is part of an elaborate courtship ritual requiring consent from both parents, but is now widely abused to justify early marriages. ""I didn't know what to do when he proposed so I said yes,"" said Yani, looking away shyly as she spoke in her village where children and chickens roam the streets. ""We rode off on a motorbike from the beach to his relative's house."" Her parents did not know where she was for days until the village heads came to say that Yani had been taken by the boy and was preparing for marriage. ""I was angry and upset, I cried non-stop as I tried to search for her,"" said her mother Nur Halima as she cradled Yani's two-month-old baby girl. ""She had not finished school, but what can I do except let her get married? If she returns unmarried she could bring shame on our family,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Stories like Yani's are common across Lombok, but activists are fighting back with an unusual approach of joining forces with village elders to restore the traditional ways of ""merariq"".  MARRIAGES GO UNREGISTERED Globally 12 million girls become child brides each year, according to campaign group Girls Not Brides. They face greater risks of exploitation, sexual violence, domestic abuse and death in childbirth. In Indonesia, a Southeast Asian archipelago of 260 million, poverty and tradition lead to one in nine girls being married before age 18, according to official statistics. And the West Nusa Tenggara province, which includes Lombok, ranks among Indonesia's top 10 for child marriage. Lombok's bride kidnapping ritual dates back generations among the Sasak, an ethnic Muslim group of about 3 million who mostly live on the island east of the resort destination Bali. At one time, negotiations were held between families after a Sasak man set his sights on a woman, in contrast to bride kidnappings plaguing countries like Kyrgyzstan, Mali and Ethiopia. The man would then take the woman to an agreed location to see if they were compatible, as relatives supervised. Now the ritual often results in sad tales like Yani's – an easy excuse for men to force marriage on young vulnerable women. Once a girl is with a suitor for days, parents are typically so desperate to avoid social stigma they agree to the union. In Lombok, which sends one of the highest numbers of Indonesians overseas as migrant workers, some parents feel their daughters can be better looked after in their absence if they marry. It also alleviates a financial burden. ""It is done in the name of tradition, so people just accept it blindly regardless if it is right or wrong,"" said Faozan, of the local non-profit Village Children Protection Group. Faozan, who like many Indonesians uses one name, said rampant underage marriage on Lombok has been linked to social ills ranging from divorce to unplanned pregnancies, maternal deaths and stunting among children. In addition, Islamic ceremonies are common. Islamic law permits such unions but because they are not formally registered women are often denied their rights and maintenance payments in the case of divorce. Yani, who was married under Islamic law and divorced by her husband a month before she gave birth, is struggling to get her baby a birth certificate as her marriage was never formally registered. Indonesia's Women Empowerment and Child Protection Ministry said in a recent statement that it planned to raise awareness through education among children, parents and religious leaders to end child marriage. It did not reply to a request for comment. The government has stated that raising the age of marriage would save children from underage unions. The change came after Indonesia's top court last year ruled in favour of a petition by women's rights groups who argued the rule discriminated against girls, who could marry at 16 while the legal age for men is 19. But the new law permits exceptions if parents ask the court for permission, raising concerns that young women could still be forced to marry in large numbers. WEAVING AND BUFFALO Wearing a traditional Muslim ""songkok"" prayer cap and a batik shirt, Sasak elder Muhamad Rais is among senior figures who advise local people on traditional customs in matters like birth, marriage and death. Since 2016 he has worked with local charities under a pilot project to revive the original ""merariq"" traditions, which he said are governed by a set of complicated steps that must be carefully followed before the ""kidnapping ritual"" takes place. ""I am sad, embarrassed and angry,"" Rais told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a bamboo hut where he regularly dispenses advice to villagers. ""Our tradition has been abused by our own people. The victims are our girls and women,"" said Rais, 54. Key to his work is re-introducing an element known as ""belas"" to the rituals, which allows the girl and boy to be separated if they are deemed not yet fit for marriage. And while traditional ""merariq"" customs do not stipulate a minimum age, Rais said the woman must have weaved 144 pieces of cloth and the man must have reared buffalo which have produced 25 offspring before they can wed. In other words, they must be adults. The pilot project, in place in four villages since 2016, has stopped some 20 underage unions according to Lombok-based charity Child and Youth Protection Institution, which is spearheading the initiative. ""We can't blame the tradition, because it's the deviation from its original practice that led to all these issues,"" said spokeswoman Baiq Zulhiatina. ""What we are trying to do is to change the mindset of our people and tell them stopping child marriage is not shameful."" (Reporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi; Editing by Chris Michaud.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L8N27F0PN	"By Naimul Karim DHAKA, Oct 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Traumatised Bangladeshi women who return home after being tortured and abused working in the Middle East rarely get justice because brokers intimidate them and they cannot afford legal aid, a rights group said on Wednesday. In interviews with 110 returnees, 86% did not receive their full salaries, 61% were physically abused, 24% were deprived of food and 14% were sexually abused, local migrant rights group Ovibashi Karmi Unnayan Program (OKUP) found. Nuri Begum went to court in August seeking compensation from her broker, or dalal, after she was tortured and worked unpaid as a maid for a family in Saudi Arabia for two months, and then spent two months in jail before flying home to Bangladesh. ""My dalal beat me up and broke my leg when I filed a case against him,"" Begum told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""I was in the hospital for 15 days. I stay with a friend right now, far away from my house because (the broker) lives nearby my place. Anisul Islam Mahmud, who chairs a parliamentary committee that monitors the work of the Ministry of Expatriate Welfare and Overseas Employment, said that the government needs to spend more money on migrants and ""nurture"" them. ""The demand for our female workers is increasing and we have to protect them ... the ministry is trying its level best, but there are loopholes. We have to work on filling up these loopholes,"" he said. Bangladesh is one of the world's biggest labour-exporting countries with about 700,000 people finding jobs overseas each year. But recruitment is largely carried out by unofficial brokers, which opens the door to trafficking and exploitation. About one in 10 migrants are women. Many are uneducated and poor and they often receive false promises of salaries of about 20,000 taka ($237) a month by middlemen and rarely get job contracts - although this is a legal requirement, OKUP said. Thousands of female migrant workers come home empty-handed each year, but only 318 received compensation - averaging 9,200 taka each - from the government's Bureau of Manpower Employment and Training in 2018, the study found. Some 83,000 Bangladeshi women went to work in the Middle East in 2017 - a four-fold increase in two years, following the signing of a labour agreement between Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia in 2015, government data shows. An increasing number of women have also returned home, claiming mistreatment, according to the charity BRAC, which recorded 1,300 returns in 2018 and 900 so far in 2019, all of whom said they were tortured or abused. Many of the women interviewed by OKUP said recruiting agents in the Middle East beat, throttled and starved them to force them to return to abusive employers, while their families had to pay for their journey home. But they rarely go to court because they see the system as corrupt, do not want to be stigmatised for sharing what happened to them and fear that their agents will pressurise them to drop cases, OKUP said. Despite the challenges, Begum, is adamant about seeing the court process through. ""After he beat me up, I am not turning back,"" she said.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_KBN1X92CO	"By Michelle Nichols UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The fight for justice for victims of Islamic State militants does not end with the death of leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Nobel laureate Nadia Murad said on Wednesday, asking: ""How about those that raped us?"" Murad, who won the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, is an Iraqi Yazidi woman who was enslaved and raped by Islamic State (ISIS)fighters in Mosul, Iraq, in 2014. Several of her brothers were killed by Islamic State and their wives also held captive. Since 2010, Baghdadi led the jihadist group. U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that Baghdadi killed himself by detonating a suicide vest after fleeing into a dead-end tunnel during a raid by U.S. special forces in northwest Syria. ""At first I talked to my sisters-in-law,"" Murad told reporters at the United Nations. ""Everyone was saying: 'OK, but this is just Baghdadi, how about all these ISIS?'"" ""How about those that raped us? They sold us, they still have our girls, they still have our children - about 300,000 Yazidis still missing, we don't know anything about them,"" she said. U.N. experts warned in June 2016 that Islamic State was committing genocide against the Yazidis in Syria and Iraq to destroy the minority religious community through killings, sexual slavery and other crimes.  Islamic State militants consider the Yazidis to be devil-worshippers. The Yazidi faith has elements of Christianity, Zoroastrianism and Islam.  ""There is thousands of ISIS, they joined al Baghdadi and they continue to do what he did,"" Murad said. ""So it wasn't only Baghdadi, we have to know there is thousands of ISIS like Baghdadi ... and they are not giving up."" ""We want to see them in justice,"" she said. A U.N. investigative team, created by the U.N. Security Council, is collecting and preserving evidence of acts by Islamic State in Iraq that may be war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide. Murad and human rights lawyer Amal Clooney had long pushed Iraq to allow U.N. investigators to help. ""Those captured alive need to be brought to justice in an open court for the world to see.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L2N27F1DR	"By Michelle Nichols UNITED NATIONS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The fight for justice for victims of Islamic State militants does not end with the death of leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Nobel laureate Nadia Murad said on Wednesday, asking: ""How about those that raped us?"" Murad, who won the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, is an Iraqi Yazidi woman who was enslaved and raped by Islamic State (ISIS)fighters in Mosul, Iraq, in 2014. Several of her brothers were killed by Islamic State and their wives also held captive. Since 2010, Baghdadi led the jihadist group. U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that Baghdadi killed himself by detonating a suicide vest after fleeing into a dead-end tunnel during a raid by U.S. special forces in northwest Syria. ""At first I talked to my sisters-in-law,"" Murad told reporters at the United Nations. ""Everyone was saying: 'OK, but this is just Baghdadi, how about all these ISIS?'"" ""How about those that raped us? They sold us, they still have our girls, they still have our children - about 300,000 Yazidis still missing, we don't know anything about them,"" she said. U.N. experts warned in June 2016 that Islamic State was committing genocide against the Yazidis in Syria and Iraq to destroy the minority religious community through killings, sexual slavery and other crimes. Islamic State militants consider the Yazidis to be devil-worshippers. The Yazidi faith has elements of Christianity, Zoroastrianism and Islam. ""There is thousands of ISIS, they joined al Baghdadi and they continue to do what he did,"" Murad said. ""So it wasn't only Baghdadi, we have to know there is thousands of ISIS like Baghdadi ... and they are not giving up."" ""We want to see them in justice,"" she said. A U.N. investigative team, created by the U.N. Security Council, is collecting and preserving evidence of acts by Islamic State in Iraq that may be war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide. Murad and human rights lawyer Amal Clooney had long pushed Iraq to allow U.N. investigators to help. ""Those captured alive need to be brought to justice in an open court for the world to see. Justice is the only acceptable course of action,"" Murad wrote on Twitter on Sunday. ""We must unite and hold #ISIS terrorists accountable in the same way the world tried the Nazis in an open court at the Nuremberg Trials.""

The driver, who was transporting fruit and vegetables, called police after he found 12 adult men - 11 Syrians and one of Sudanese origin - in the truck on Wednesday morning after a stop for the night. Police took them to the Immigration Office in the city of Antwerp. All were in good health, police said. A spokeswoman for the federal police said the prosecutor's office in Antwerp had opened an investigation into the incident, which occurred on motorway E34 near the town of Turnhout. The investigation is to determine the planned route of the truck, how the migrants climbed on board and if they were trying to reach Britain. Last week, 39 migrants were found dead in a refrigerated truck in Britain after crossing from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge. Belgian authorities, facing increasing scrutiny of their fight against human trafficking, are cooperating with a British investigation. Migrants sometimes choose refrigerated trucks to cross borders because their construction makes it more difficult for dogs and heat scanners at checkpoints to detect stowaways. Belgian paper De Morgen reported that in the Turnhout incident, the truck driver and his co-driver were Polish and called the police after noticing on Wednesday morning that the seal on the trailer was broken.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L8N27F6PC	"By Roli Srivastava MUMBAI, Oct 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Facebook is failing to rein in a ""tsunami"" of hate posts inflaming ethnic tensions in India's Assam state, campaign group Avaaz said on Wednesday, with content about ""criminals"", ""rapists"", ""terrorists"" and ""dogs"" shared almost 100,000 times. Avaaz said the dehumanising language - often targeting India's Bengali Muslims - was similar to that used on Facebook about Myanmar's Rohingya before an army crackdown and ethnic violence forced 700,000 Rohingya to flee in 2017 to Bangladesh. A Facebook spokesman said the company was proactively removing 65% of hate speech before it was reported globally, and that its content reviewers, working in at least nine Indian languages, were rigorously trained to ""catch harmful content"". The United Nations warned of rising hate speech on social media in India's northeastern Assam state as the government prepared to publish a list of Indian citizens in the state that left out nearly 2 million people, many Bengali Muslims. ""Facebook is being used as a megaphone for hate, pointed directly at vulnerable minorities in Assam, many of whom could be made stateless within months,"" Alaphia Zoyab, a campaigner at Avaaz, said in a statement. To be included on the register, published in August, residents had to prove their families lived in India before March 24, 1971, when hundreds of thousands of people began fleeing conflict across the border in what is now Bangladesh. Resentment against illegal immigrants has simmered for years in Assam, one of India's poorest states, with residents blaming outsiders, mainly Bangladeshis, for taking their jobs and land. Avaaz, which campaigns against disinformation on social media, analysed 800 Facebook posts and comments relating to Assam and the register, and found that about 27% constituted hate speech, which it estimated had been viewed 5 million times. It flagged 213 posts to Facebook, which removed 96 of them, including one by an elected official implying that those who rape ""our mothers and sisters"" are ""Bangladeshi Muslims"", and calls to ""poison"" daughters and legalise female foeticide. Facebook has been criticised for not acting to stamp out hate speech on its platform in Myanmar and for not stopping the use of fake accounts aiming to sway public opinion in the 2016 U.S. election and Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Avaaz said Facebook was too reliant on artificial intelligence hate speech detection mechanisms, and needed to put in place more human-led teams to monitor content in Assam. ""Despite the clear and present danger faced by these people, Facebook is refusing to dedicate the resources required to keep them safe,"" said Zoyab. ""Through its inaction, Facebook is complicit in the persecution of some of the world's most vulnerable people."" Facebook's spokesman said the use of artificial intelligence had improved its hate speech detection and that it had invested in tools to encourage people to flag up inappropriate content. ""While we're making progress, our technology isn't perfect yet. That's why reports from our community are still incredibly important,"" he said.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L8N27F761	"By Nellie Peyton DAKAR, Oct 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A new online database of human trafficking cases will help Senegal crack down on a rampant crime that is little understood, highlighting hotspots and profiling crooks in a bid to curb the   growing trade in people, the government said on Wednesday. The 'Systraite' system will collect information on victims, convictions, traffickers and more, hoping better data cuts opportunities for crime, a justice ministry official said. The West African country is a source, transit and destination country for trafficking, with children forced to beg on city streets and young women trafficked for sex work in mining camps. But there is no reliable data on how common this is or where it is happening, said Awa Ndour, a programme officer in the National Unit for Combating Trafficking in Persons (CNLTP). ""In Senegal, we don't have enough formal statistics to be able to do an evaluation,"" Ndour said. ""We wanted to create a data collection system that will allow us to analyse the evolution and trends in human trafficking,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Systraite was officially launched last week in partnership with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), and with funding from the U.S. Department of State. IOM, a United Nations agency, provided computers and internet modems to juvenile courts and prosecutors so they can enter data into the system, as well as organising training. ""It's an important step because what poses a problem most of the time is data,"" said Candide Migan, a programme assistant at IOM. ""At the very least this will shine a bit more light on which cases make it to the courts."" The system is in a pilot phase in five regions, with a goal to expand it nationwide. Anti-trafficking experts have pushed for technology to be used more in the fight against human trafficking, in part because the criminals themselves increasingly use tools such as mobile apps and cryptocurrency. In West Africa, authorities are just starting to use digital systems at a basic level to share information and work together. Human Rights Watch estimates that 100,000 children are forced to beg in Senegal, usually as students at Koranic schools where many families consider it tradition. This is the most prevalent form of trafficking in the country, according to IOM, although many cases of forced begging are not prosecuted under the anti-trafficking law.

But now he regularly unlocks his old cell door to show tourists what life was like in a jail run by the Stasi secret police. A West German responsible for his chemical company's business in the East, Schulze was on his way to a trade fair in the East German city of Leipzig in 1986 when he stopped at a motorway service station and met a woman by chance. Schulze, now 66, was fascinated by the well-dressed woman and they began a relationship. The East-West dimension of their liaison gave Schulze a thrill, but to this day he does not know for sure whether she loved him or was just using him. ""I didn't know that she was an unofficial Stasi informant,"" said Schulze, who gives tours of Hohenschoenhausen prison, where he spent some of his 13 months behind bars three decades ago, in eastern Berlin. ""It was only later, when the accusation of spying was raised, that everything appeared in a different light."" Such themes of temptation, duplicity and betrayal that marked Cold War-era espionage have come back into focus in the run-up to the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9 that brought about German reunification.  ""ROMEO SPIES"" Schulze found out some time after he became romantically involved with the woman that her husband - from whom she was separated - worked for the Stasi, but he did not grasp the full extent until the media reported on her Stasi files in 2009. Under its foreign intelligence chief Markus Wolf, the Stasi perfected the use of ""Romeo spies"" - agents who used their personal charms as well as their wiles to ensnare Western sources of valuable intelligence. Unbeknown to Schulze, his lover had been tasked by the Stasi with picking up solo travellers and business people from the West. She told him she wanted to flee to the West and Schulze still isn't sure whether that was her personal desire or whether the Stasi wanted her to continue working for them in the West. Three years before the fall of the Wall, Schulze was arrested at the border as he tried to leave the East. A letter the woman had written about her husband's work was found in his car, as was some money she wanted Schulze to take to the West. Schulze was accused of spying and a day later his lover was arrested, though he is not sure what the charge against her was. East German authorities ultimately withdrew accusations of spying, subversive human trafficking and betraying state secrets - which would have triggered a long prison term - and he was ultimately sentenced to 2-1/2 years in prison for currency crimes and helping prepare an illegal border crossing. ""I can tell you it really hits you hard. You have to absorb it first,"" he said of the emotional manipulation. ""And I know now that they did it on purpose - that's what I accuse them of."" Schulze thinks his status as a West German meant he was probably treated better than others at Hohenschoenhausen, where physical violence was widely used in the 1950s before psychological interrogation methods took over. He was transferred to another prison before his release in October 1987. His lover, who had spent her imprisonment working in the kitchen at Hohenschoenhausen, was freed a month later. They saw each other in prison but Schulze said their relationship ended around the time they were released, and after reunification in 1990 she became a car saleswoman and hotel director in the West. It was initially hard for Schulze to return to the prison followingr reunification but he wants to make sure that others - including children born long after East Germany collapsed - know what happened behind the prison's walls. He now tells his story to some of the more than 455,000 people who visit Hohenschoenhausen every year. Thousands of political prisoners were incarcerated in the prison, which has since been turned into a museum and memorial. ""That period of time still affects me to this day and that's why I give tours here now, to pass on the message,"" Schulze said.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L8N27F615	"BRUSSELS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Thousands of inmates about to be freed from European prisons at the end of their terms may have been radicalised as Islamist militants in detention and pose a risk, the European Union security chief said on Wednesday. Returning fighters from Syria are also a concern, EU security commissioner Julian King told a news conference. Over the last two decades Europe has been the target of several Islamist militant assaults, with a rise in deadly attacks from 2015, when more than 130 people were killed in Paris in a coordinated operation in mid-November. Security forces in EU countries have since arrested hundreds of militants, with about 1,100 still being held on terrorism charges, King said. King said that twice that many, who are detained for other crimes, may also have been radicalised in European jails. ""We face a challenge from those who have been prosecuted and locked up in prison for terrorist offences over recent years coming to the end of their term and being released. There are some thousands of such individuals in our prisons across Europe,"" King said. ""The Jihadi threat has not gone away,"" he said referring to the Arabic term for holy war. ""There is no way we can lower our guard,"" he added. In addition to this domestic challenge, Europe also faces security risks posed by EU citizens who fought in the Middle East for the so-called Islamic State (IS) or with other Islamist militant groups and could now return to the continent, exploiting the volatile situation in Syria. ""Obviously the events in Syria at the moment do not make that any easier,"" King said. Turkey this month launched a military offensive on Syria's Kurdish-controlled north-east region, where most IS militants are locked up. About 500 European fighters were detained in Syria, King said. The Kurds have repeatedly warned that they could no longer guarantee the surveillance of IS detainees in their jails because of the Turkish offensive. King said that up to 1,400 children with one or two parents holding the citizenship of one of the 28 EU countries were also in Syria, of which half are in prison. Some of them are currently being repatriated by EU states, but legal challenges have for long delayed operations.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N27E1H3	"DO THANH, Vietnam, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Vietnam's ""Billionaire Village"" doesn't sound like a place people would want to leave, but at least three of the 39 victims found in the back of a lorry in Britain last week set off from there in search of their fortunes. A billion dong may only be around $43,000, but in the rural, northern-central Vietnamese town of Do Thanh, the money goes a long way, and even farmers live in palatial mansions, paid for with money sent back by family members working abroad. ""70-80% of the villas here have been built with remittances,"" said Nguyen Van Ha, chairman of the rural, rice-farming commune in Nghe An province. ""If you work in Vietnam earning dong, it would take a long time to build a big house like this,"" Ha said, gesturing to the large, multi-storey villas flanking the town hall. In Do Thanh, even the majestic, renaissance-style church towering over the plush, neighbouring villas was built with remittance money donated by the Catholic community. Many other victims are believed to come from outside the town, in the surrounding district of Yen Thanh. In the 1980s, Do Thanh used to be one of the district's poorest villages, according to state media. One resident, 19-year-old Bui Thi Nhung, is thought by her family to be among the dead. She left a trail of messages on her social media account documenting her journey through Europe in the days before she boarded the fated vehicle. Deputy Foreign Minister Nguyen Quoc Cuong told Reuters on Tuesday the nationality of the victims had not been officially confirmed but that Vietnam and Britain were ""trying to speed up identification of the bodies"". The grisly discovery last week on an industrial estate near London, a magnet for Vietnamese migrants, has shone a spotlight on people smugglers bringing the poor of Asia, Africa and the Middle East on perilous journeys to the West. In Vietnam, poor job prospects, encouragement by authorities, smuggling gangs, environmental disasters and government pressure on Catholics are all factors pushing people to leave.  REMITTANCE RISE But even though the cost of getting to Europe can run into thousands of dollars for migrants ready to pay for a so-called ""VIP"" service, they believe they can make enough money to justify the risk. ""We know that many residents of this district are living in Britain, but we have no idea what they do there to earn all this money to send back home,"" Ha said. Overseas workers sent nearly $16 billion in remittances to Vietnam in 2018, more than double the Southeast Asian country's trade surplus for the same period, according to World Bank data that showed remittances had risen 130% over the last decade. In Nghe An and neighbouring Ha Tinh province, official policy supports the legal export of labour. Nghe An province alone rakes in some $255 million annually from its overseas citizens, according to state media. ""The remittance figures might be higher than reported as money transferred through unofficial ways, such as cash or as physical consumer goods, is not counted,"" said Nguyen Tri Hieu, a Hanoi-based economist and former government adviser. Many of the same networks which smuggle people also smuggle cash, in return for commission.  WEED AND NAILS About 70 percent of Vietnamese trafficking cases in Britain between 2009 and 2016 were related to labour exploitation, with migrants lured into jobs growing cannabis illegally and working in nail salons, Britain said last year. But many find legal work too, including in Europe, the United States and closer to home in Japan, Taiwan and neighbouring Laos. In Nghe An, which borders Laos, GDP per capita stands at $1,636, well below Vietnam's national average of $2,540. ""I didn't have enough money to go abroad so I went to Saigon instead,"" said Bui Van Diep, a welder, using the old name for Ho Chi Minh City. He lives in a small shack in Do Thanh. His cousin, Bui Chung lives in a large, gleaming villa next door - with enough space leftover to park his jet black BMW. Bui Chung left Do Thanh for Britain in 2007, and when he returned home he built his house and started a steel trading business. ""I went from Vietnam to France legally, but from France to the UK illegally inside a container truck,"" said Chung. ""I chose to go to the UK because the salary is very good and so many people from Do Thanh had already lived there."" Chung worked in a cannabis farm in Britain, and at a Vietnamese-run nail salon where he said he earned around 500 pounds ($640) a week. ""The Vietnamese community living there help newcomers to find jobs,"" Chung said. ""That's why many people around here are willing to even sell their land to raise enough money to go."" Now, he believes he made a huge mistake returning home. ""I've lost a lot of money doing business here. People don't trust each other,"" he said. ""I might go back to the UK"".

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L8N27D5Q6	"(Fixes job title in paragraph 23) By Emma Batha LONDON, Oct 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The deaths of 39 migrants found in a refrigerated truck in Britain has reignited calls for efforts to tackle slavery in the nail bar sector, a common destination for trafficked Vietnamese. Most of the people discovered in the truck are believed to be from Vietnam, one of the top source countries for victims of modern slavery in Britain - accounting for about 10% of 7,000 suspected slaves referred to the government for support in 2018. Police are still investigating the case and it is not yet clear why the victims were travelling to Britain. But it is well documented that some Vietnamese - lured to Europe by promises of lucrative jobs - end up exploited in illegal cannabis farms and cheap nail bars which have proliferated across the country. ""It's an extreme tragedy and I think hopefully it will be a catalyst for some sort of change,"" said Philippa Southwell, a lawyer with Birds Solicitors who specialises in trafficking. ""(We need) tighter regulation in various sectors such as cash-in-hand nail bars and car washes where it is easy for exploitation to take place,"" she said, adding that nail salons were often used to launder proceeds from criminal activity. Although many nail bars set up by Britain's Vietnamese community are legitimate, experts say traffickers have piggy-backed off their success. Anti-slavery charity Unseen said labour exploitation at beauty salons was the second biggest concern after carwashes for callers to its hotline last year, with 477 potential victims. Britain's anti-slavery chief said on Tuesday that most recommendations made by her office in 2017 on tackling the issue - including regulation of nail bars - had not been implemented. Trafficking experts said the deaths, which were discovered on Oct. 23, should be a ""clarion call"" for stronger action to protect trafficking victims and called for tighter controls including more labour inspections. Northern Irish truck driver Maurice Robinson appeared in court on Monday accused of manslaughter, money laundering, conspiracy to traffic people and conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration.  LOCKED UP In 2017, Britain's former anti-slavery commissioner Kevin Hyland called for tighter regulation of nail bars in a report on combating trafficking involving Vietnamese nationals. One victim quoted in his report worked seven days a week for 30 pounds ($40). Another had to give all his money to his enslavers who locked him up between shifts. Hyland said Britain should look at New York which had introduced controls on nail bars. His successor Sara Thornton said the majority of the report's 35 recommendations had not been implemented. ""Although we don't yet know the full details of this case, it appears to bear the hallmarks of human trafficking,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""My office will be looking at what more can be done to improve our response to this heinous crime and reviewing the outstanding recommendations of this report will be an important part of this."" The interior ministry could not immediately comment. The British Association of Beauty Therapy and Cosmetology (BABTAC) said there was an urgent need for regulation, ideally by an independent industry body. BABTAC, which launched a campaign two years ago with Unseen to raise awareness of exploitation in nail bars, said it would also like to see a mandatory code and labour inspections. But others said there was no need for an independent body. Emily Kenway, senior adviser for the charity Focus on Labour Exploitation, called for more investment in labour inspections. ""Some people will think we should have a stamp, but it isn't the solution,"" said Kenway. ""We need to fund labour inspection properly and we need to stop criminalising undocumented people."" She said criminalisation prevented trafficking victims seeking help for fear of arrest and deportation - which played into the hands of their exploiters and hampered efforts to tackle the issue. Tell-tale indicators of exploitation in nail bars include unfeasibly low prices, workers who appear very young or are unwilling to make eye contact, and overbearing managers who insist on taking the money. Women questioned on the streets in London said they were aware that exploitation was an issue in nail bars. ""I always make sure they look happy,"" said banker Sonia Patla, 31. ""You notice the ones who aren't happy, who aren't talking. Also if the prices are too cheap it makes you wonder why they're so cheap.""

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N27F02H	"By Greg Stutchbury TOKYO, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Identifying talent, having the courage to select players with growth potential and showing a willingness to change were key components of a successful rugby coach, former All Blacks loose forward Murray Mexted has said. Mexted, who played 72 matches for the All Blacks from 1979-85, set up the International Rugby Academy New Zealand in 2002 to help develop coaches and players. He told Reuters in an interview that 2011 World Cup winning coach Graham Henry had stressed the importance of selection. ""Graham Henry recently said that 60% of being a good coach is selection,"" Mexted told Reuters in Tokyo. ""Selection is really important, but I'd call it identification. ""Identification of skills in relation to each position then being able to see 'X-factor' in those candidates and ... you need to have courage to see growth and to select growth."" Mexted highlighted George Bridge (24), Sevu Reece (22), Tom Curry (21) and Sam Underhill (23) as examples of how their national team coaches Steve Hansen and Eddie Jones were able to identify young talent and mould it to suit the game they wanted to play. Wingers Bridge and Reece only became All Blacks starters against Australia in August and have less than 10 caps each. England loose forwards Curry and Underhill, both of whom made their debuts on the 2017 tour of Argentina, each have less than 20 but have helped their side reach Saturday's Rugby World Cup final against South Africa. Mexted also said the top coaches were keen to broaden their experience and find ways of improving communication with players. ""You'll normally find the best coaches are the ones who have a wide range of attributes,"" he added. ""Empathy with players and understanding and feeling what they are feeling and to communicate with them is important. ""You also need to be open minded and to want to grow and change ... (former All Blacks assistant coach) Wayne Smith is an example of that. ""He wanted to grow his awareness of the game. At one stage he was an attack coach, then he became a defence coach and crossed boundaries, so you have to be prepared to do that."" Despite the advances in sports science and the evolution of rugby, he said, at its essence it was still a relatively simple game -- get hold of the ball, control it and create opportunities to exploit space. The big problem was getting all 15 players on a team to work together to do exactly that, he said with a grin. And while coaches did not need to be an 'outside-the-box thinker' to be successful they did need to be adaptable. ""Rugby is a big challenge. You have got 15 players and you have to get them wanting to work together to get the outcome you want,"" he said. ""You don't need to be a radical thinker, there are other things that come first. ""If you want to develop as a coach, then the more you do the better you get. You don't get worse, you get better. But the higher the level you go, you do need something else.""

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26V3T4	"By Helen Reid, Barbara Lewis and Emmanuel Herman TANGA, Tanzania Oct 30 (Reuters) - A new network of government-controlled trading centres was meant to ensure Tanzania's small-scale miners got a bigger share of the country's mineral wealth. But most still can't get a foot in the door. Literally. Entry to the 28 exchanges scattered around the East African nation is restricted to those who can afford the licenses needed to sell the precious metals, which at around $44, is beyond the means of most small-scale miners who often run up debts just to extract gold and other precious metals from rented land. That means they are effectively excluded from trading on these formal marketplaces – the centerpiece of President John Magufuli’s drive to curb the black market in mineral wealth. Magufuli has built his base by promising to empower poor Tanzanians, and his attempts to formalise the sale of gold and other minerals are seen as progressive compared to other countries, such as neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, where there have been violent crackdowns https://www.reuters.com/article/us-congo-mining-insight/send-in-the-troops-congo-raises-the-stakes-on-illegal-mining-idUSKCN1UC0BS) on informal miners. The new mineral trading centres make pricing more transparent, but there is no law that guarantees the miners a fair share. Instead, the new system has strengthened the position of pit owners and, in particular, the middlemen who help finance them, according to small-scale miners, analysts and non-governmental organizations. It has also poured money from royalties and clearance fees into government coffers since its inception in March. Known locally as dealers or brokers, middlemen have traditionally controlled Tanzania’s vast informal mining sector, through the loans they make to miners and pit owners and their ownership of many of the facilities used to process the gold. Dealers own the majority of the trading licenses needed to buy minerals in the exchanges, and pit owners own the majority of the mining licenses needed to sell in them, according to Tanzania's Mining Commission, which is the government department that issues the licenses and oversees the industry. ""The concern is we have a new class of mining entrepreneurs,"" said Edward Hobey-Hamsher, analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, a consultancy. ""It's the workers at the bottom who are the most vulnerable and will continue to be."" Since 2000, 29,000 mining licenses have been distributed, including 3,000 between July 1 2018 and June 31 2019, according to Professor Shukrani Manya, head of the Mining Commission. That compares to an estimated 6 million people who work as informal miners, according to The Tanzania Mines, Energy, Construction and Allied Workers’ Union (TAMICO), mostly mining gold after its price rose 16% this year. In a statement, TAMICO said it did not see dealers as obstacles to fair prices for miners but said they would have higher earnings if they bargained collectively, in a union. Thomas Munis, chairman of the Tanzania Mineral Dealers' Association (TAMIDA), denied that dealers, who number around 50,000 in Tanzania, exploited miners. ""These arrangements with the artisanal miners are legally binding and everyone is protected by the contracts signed,"" he said on the sidelines of a meeting of small-scale miners in Tanga, a port city north of the capital, Dar es Salaam. ""There is no chance for anyone to be exploited."" The Minister for Minerals Doto Biteko did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.  A FAIR SHARE Artisanal mining plays a key role in the wider mining sector because it can rapidly increase supply when prices rise. But it is dangerous with frequent accidents and the risk of contamination from the use of mercury, a highly poisonous substance, to recover gold particles from soil. It can also be a hard way to make a living. Even before they put a shovel in the ground, miners have to pay rent on the land they dig, which works out at around 45,000 Tanzanian shillings ($19.58) per year per acre, according to TAMICO, a large amount in a country where the average annual income is around $881, according to a 2017 analysis by the World Bank. Instead of a regular wage, miners have production-sharing arrangements with pit owners. The pit owners, in turn, often give the dealers the right to process the metal and sell it on, because they are in debt to them. The dealers usually divvy up the proceeds. Sometimes, if the miners strike lucky and the price is high, that can mean a windfall but much depends on how the takings are split. Dealers typically take around 30% of the proceeds themselves, with another 30% going to the pit owner and the remainder split between ten or more mineworkers. ""Most artisanal miners depend on brokers for almost everything including food,"" said Paulo Maliganya, a small-scale miner who works in Kakora, in Tanzania's northern Geita region, close to the country's biggest gold mine owned by South Africa's AngloGold Ashanti. ""They created dependence in many artisanal miners and they pay an amount which is a bit lower than the market prices."" The government itself is turning out a big winner from the new system. Gold worth 465.7 billion Tanzania shillings ($202 million) has been traded through the exchanges since they were set up in March, earning the state 35.4 billion ($15.4 million) in royalties, inspection fees and service levies, according to Manya, the head of the Mining Commission. The amount traded is a fraction of the $1.5 billion worth of gold exported last year from Tanzania, which works out at about 33 tonnes according to Reuters' calculations. Small-scale miners produce around 20 tonnes of gold per year in Tanzania according to a 2013 report by a parliamentary committee -- the latest official tally -- but the vast bulk of that is estimated to be illegally exported. The state is hoping that as more licenses are issued, the official trade will grow. ""Revenue has increased drastically … the efforts are paying off,"" said Gerald Mturi, executive secretary of the Tanzania Chamber of Mines. ""I expect big volumes to be reported at the end of the year."" Earlier this year, Biteko, the Minister for Minerals, told Reuters the government had cancelled around 1,000 inactive mining licenses and would redistribute them to small-scale miners. He did not respond to requests for an update on the planned redistribution of licenses.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_KBN1X81ZW	"By Raya Jalabi SHARYA CAMP, Iraq (Reuters) - Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's death will mean nothing to 19-year-old rape victim Jamila unless the Islamic State militants who enslaved her are brought to justice. Jamila, who asked not to be identified by her last name, is one of thousands of women from the Yazidi minority religion who were kidnapped and raped by IS after it mounted an assault on the Yazidi homeland in northern Iraq in August 2014. ""Even if Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead, it doesn't mean Islamic State is dead,"" Jamila told Reuters outside the tent that is now her temporary home in the Sharya camp for displaced Yazidis in Iraq's Kurdistan Region.  ""This doesn't feel like justice yet,"" she said. ""I want the men who took me, who raped me, to stand trial. And I want to have my voice heard in court. I want to face them in court ... Without proper trials, his death has no meaning."" Baghdadi, who had led IS since 2010, detonated a suicide vest after being cornered in a raid by U.S. special forces in northwest Syria, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Sunday. Inspired by his edicts to enslave and slaughter Yazidis, whom IS regard as infidels, his followers shot, beheaded and kidnapped thousands in a rampage which the United Nations called a genocidal campaign against them. Along with thousands of other women and children, Jamila said she was enslaved by the militants and kept in captivity for five months in the city of Mosul along with her sister.  She was just 14 when she was seized. But her problems did not end after she and her sister managed to escape when, she said, their guards were high on drugs. ""When I first came back, I had a nervous breakdown and psychological problems for two years, so I couldn't go to school,"" she said. Now instead of working or catching up on her years of lost schooling, she looks after her mother, with whom she shares her cramped tent at the camp.  ""My mother can't walk and has health problems so I have to stay and take care of her because my older siblings are in Germany,"" she said.  NO PLANS TO GO HOME The prospect of going home to Sinjar in northern Iraq is not an option for Jamila, and many others. The city still lies in ruin four years after the IS onslaught, and suspicion runs deep in the ethnically mixed area. ""Sinjar is completely destroyed. Even if we could go back, I wouldn't want to because we'd be surrounded by the same Arab neighbors who all joined IS in the first place, and helped them kill us (Yazidis),"" she said.  Thousands of men are being tried in Iraqi courts for their ties to IS. Iraq has so far not allowed victims to testify in court, something community leaders and human rights groups say would go a long way in the healing process. ""It is deplorable that not a single victim of Islamic State's horrific abuses including sexual slavery has gotten their day in court,"" said Belkis Wille, Iraq Researcher for Human Rights Watch. ""Iraq's justice system is designed to allow the state to exact mass revenge against suspects, not provide real accountability for victims."" For some of the nearly 17,000 Yazidis at the Sharya camp, Baghdadi's death was a first step in that direction though they fear the IS fighters who are still alive. Mayan Sinu, 25, can dream of a new life after the camp as she and her three children have been granted asylum by Australia. But she also wants the men who shot her husband in the legs and dragged him off to be brought to justice. He has been missing since the incident five years ago. ""I hope Baghdadi is suffering more than we ever did, and my God we suffered,"" said Sinu. ""I wish he (Baghdadi) hadn't blown himself up so I could have slaughtered him myself with my bare hands.""

It takes just 1,500 yuan ($212.28) at a pet café in southwest China that dyes pups in black and white streaks to resemble the animal that is considered a national treasure. The cafe, which opened last month in the city of Chengdu in Sichuan province, has gone viral on social media after owner Lu Yunning dyed his six chow-chow puppies to look like pandas. ""There are many dog cafes, cat cafes, raccoon cafes, alpaca cafes and duck cafes,"" said Lu, as the puppies, their limbs, ears and fur around the eyes dyed black, playfully chased a fish toy on a cord. ""We think they are not creative. We wanted something novel,"" added the 21-year-old, who estimates his cafe draws 70 to 80 customers a day, nearly doubling since he posted social media pictures of his dyed dogs. But until now customers have been more interested in taking pictures with Lu's dogs than signing up for the dye service. Lu said the imported dye he used did not harm the dogs, and was spread only on the upper part of their fur, rather than extending down to the base. To round out the vacation experience, the Candy Planet Pet Cafe also offers washing and hotel services. The attention drawn by the chow-chows has not all been positive, however, with animal rights group PETA urging people to keep away. ""Coating dogs with chemical dyes is stressful and can even cause allergic reactions on their skin, nose, and eyes,"" Jason Baker, its Asia vice president, told Reuters. ""PETA urges travellers to stay away from any business that exploits animals for a money-grabbing gimmick,"" he said in a statement. Some online commentators have accused Lu of animal abuse.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26G34E	"By Ashutosh Sharma BOBIYA, India, Oct 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When half a dozen trucks loaded with construction material screeched to a halt on their farms, Baryam Singh and fellow residents in the Indian village of Bobiya sensed they were soon going to lose more land to the military. The farmers chased away the contractors and labourers with protests and threats of deflated tyres, knowing it was only a temporary reprieve. ""The military infrastructure has been growing in our village and our farmlands are shrinking,"" Singh told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, as other farmers sitting around him nodded. ""More than 50% of our agricultural land is under military lockdown,"" he said of the village on the border with Pakistan. Over the past 15 years, the Indian army and the country's Border Security Force (BSF) have been acquiring land to fortify defences in the border districts of Jammu and Kashmir, according to the Border Welfare Committee, a local organisation campaigning for the rights of border residents. Both India and Pakistan administer the disputed state of Kashmir in part while claiming it in full. The fertile land where Jammu and Kashmir meets Pakistan has become dotted with barbed wire and landmines, leaving hundreds of farmers cut off from their farms, often with no warning or compensation, said Bobiya villagers. ""This is adding to the economic distress of farmers who don't have alternative sources of livelihood,"" said Singh. After India revoked the autonomy of its portion of Kashmir in August, farmers in border areas now fear losing even more of their land to the military, according to ID Khajuria, an activist who heads up the Jammu and Kashmir Forum for Peace and Territorial Integrity. With India bringing Jammu and Kashmir deeper into its fold, the central government will have greater power to seize territory in the border regions in the name of national security, he warned. ""The local elected political representatives will now have a very limited say in the functioning of the (Jammu and Kashmir) government,"" Khajuria said. Jammu divisional commissioner Sanjeev Verma said that all farmers in Jammu province would eventually be paid for their land. ""Whatever new agricultural land is being acquired, the farmers will get financial compensation,"" he said in a phone interview. Some have already been compensated, he added, though he declined to specify how many. 'I AM LANDLESS NOW' The defence system includes a fence of about 900 km (560 miles) in length that sits several kilometres into India from the border, slicing through villages and leaving vast tracts of farmland on the other side of the fence towards Pakistan. India's government is also working on a ""Wall of Defence"" along the border between India and Pakistan, according to the Border Security Force. The project consists of a 10-metre-high (32-foot) mud embankment to protect residents of India's border villages from frequent ceasefire violations that both sides blame on each other. There are also plans to install high-tech surveillance systems to plug gaps where physical surveillance is not possible, India's ministry of home affairs announced last year. Members of the Border Welfare Committee - which is based in the city of K    athua - said that thousands of hectares of Indian farmland now sit untouched on the other side of the fence. Technically, farmers can still get to their land, but the checkpoints in the fence are opened only during specific times of day and farmers have to walk for hours to reach their fields, explained Bharat Bhushan Sharma, the committee's vice president. Even if they do manage to successfully cultivate their crops, ""there is always a threat of cross-border fire"", said Sharma, who is also head of Bobiya village. ""And then (they) can't protect their crops from wild animals."" Committee president Nanak Chand, 87, said he lost almost eight hectares of land to the fence when it was first built in 2004. ""Three months ago, the military acquired the remaining two hectares of farmland as well,"" he said. ""I am landless now."" Chand was given 3 million rupees ($42,000) as compensation, which he says is not enough to buy himself an equivalent piece of land in a peaceful part of the country. Khajuria agreed, saying that ""with developers and businessmen from other states rushing to Jammu and Kashmir, land prices are likely to soar and it would make it difficult for poor border residents to buy land in peaceful areas."" In December 2018, Chand filed a petition with the Jammu and Kashmir High Court on behalf of farmers living in the border areas of the affected districts. The petition called for the government to pay rent for farmland on the Pakistan side of the fence and provide farmers with compensation for each crop season during which their land remains uncultivated. The Ministry of Home Affairs, the BSF and the local administration have not yet filed their responses, according to lawyers representing the farmers. Jugal Kishore Sharma, a member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party who represents the Jammu-Poonch parliamentary constituency, could not specify how much of the land along the border currently being used by the military is farmland. But he said officials in the border districts are in the process of measuring that amount. ""Thereafter, the government will start paying rent to farmers,"" he said in a phone interview. WAITING FOR PEACE Often times, when the border fence cuts through a farm, it also isolates the village in which the farm is located, said Mohammad Arif Khan, 67, head of Behrooti village in Poonch district. As a result, ""the villages (are) deprived of even the basic facilities and infrastructure,"" he explained. The huge razor-wire fence has turned Behrooti into what locals have described as an open prison. ""Our village doesn't have roads and healthcare facilities. There is no internet or mobile phone connectivity,"" said Mohammad Nisar Khan, 30, another resident. ""A zoo is visited by people every day, but here the outsiders are not allowed. Socially, we are completely isolated."" The knowledge that the military plans to add high-tech surveillance equipment to the fence is disheartening, said Khan, who like many Indians living on the border is holding out hope that the fence will one day be moved onto the border itself. ""We'll become permanent prisoners if the fence gets upgraded at its current location,"" he said. While the residents of Behrooti feel trapped in their village by the fence, others fear it will force them to leave their homes for good. ""There's little chance that our next generation will be in a position to continue living here (at the border),"" said Meer Chand, a rice farmer in Nanga village, 30 kilometres (18 miles) from Bobiya. ""We've lost hope that there will ever be peace between India and Pakistan. We have neither security of life nor livelihood."" (Reporting by Ashutosh Sharma, Editing by Jumana Farouky and Zoe Tabary.

The Democratic-controlled House voted 405-11 in favor of a resolution asserting that it is U.S. policy to commemorate as genocide the killing of 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923. The Ottoman Empire was centered in present-day Turkey. The vote marked the first time in 35 years that such legislation was considered in the full House, underscoring widespread frustration in Congress with the Turkish government, from both Democrats and President Donald Trump's fellow Republicans. Shortly after the Armenian genocide vote, House lawmakers from both parties also overwhelmingly backed legislation calling on Trump to impose sanctions on Turkey over its offensive in northern Syria, another action likely to inflame relations with NATO ally Turkey. The fate of both measures in the Senate is unclear, with no vote scheduled on similar legislation. Turkey accepts that many Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire were killed in clashes with Ottoman forces during World War One, but contests the figures and denies that the killings were systematically orchestrated and constitute a genocide. Ankara views foreign involvement in the issue as a threat to its sovereignty. For decades, measures recognizing the Armenian genocide have stalled in Congress, stymied by concerns that it could complicate relations with Turkey and intense lobbying by the Ankara government. U.S. lawmakers have been fuming about Turkey, however, in recent months, because of its purchase of a Russian missile defense system in defiance of U.S. sanctions and, more recently, its incursion into northern Syria to fight Kurdish forces after Trump abruptly announced he was withdrawing U.S. troops from the area.  QUICK CONDEMNATION BY TURKEY Turkey quickly condemned both resolutions, saying the genocide resolution ""is devoid of any historical or legal basis,"" and adding: ""As a meaningless political step, its sole addressees are the Armenian lobby and anti-Turkey groups."" Its Foreign Ministry said the sanctions measure, which targets senior officials and the Turkish armed forces, was ""incompatible with the spirit of our NATO alliance,"" and contradicted a ceasefire agreement for northern Syria reached with the Trump administration on Oct. 17. ""We urge the U.S. Congress, not to exploit bilateral issues for domestic political consumption and to act in line with the spirit of our Alliance and partnership,"" the ministry said in a statement, urging the Trump administration to take action to prevent a further deterioriation in relations. Turkey views the Kurds in northern Syria as a security threat. Many members of Congress were furious about the assault against Kurdish troops, who until recently were fighting alongside U.S. forces against Islamic State militants. Democratic U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, whose California district is home to a large Armenian-American population, has sought passage of such legislation for 19 years. He urged support for the measure in an emotional House speech that referenced the Kurds. ""When we see the images of terrified Kurdish families in northern Syria, loading their possessions into cars or carts and fleeing their homes headed to nowhere except away from Turkish bombs and marauding militias, how can we say the crimes of a century ago are in the past?"" he said. ""We cannot. We cannot pick and choose which crimes against humanity are convenient to speak about. We cannot cloak our support for human rights in euphemisms. We cannot be cowed into silence by a foreign power,"" Schiff said.

The number of people apprehended or turned away at the border actually fell in September to the lowest monthly total of the year, to 52,546, down 64% from a peak in May as migration typically slows during the hot summer months. But the total still rose 4% over the same month a year ago, and border arrests for the fiscal year ending in September reached an 11-year high. Southern border apprehensions and rejections combined totaled 977,509. Nearly half all those detained in September were children or families, many of them led by human-trafficking cartels, said Robert Perez, deputy commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. ""They are profiting on the backs of this vulnerable population, and that's why it's still a crisis,"" Perez told an outdoor news conference, standing before CBP personnel at the border barrier in El Paso. Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan said the average 1,400 people apprehended each day underscored a security risk. President Donald Trump has made restricting immigration a centerpiece of his first term and his 2020 re-election campaign, and U.S. officials and immigrant advocates alike say his policies and cooperation from Mexico have contributed to four straight months of declining arrests. While Trump's supporters cheer his crackdown on illegal border-crossings, critics have attacked his policies as cruel, resulting in overcrowded detention facilities and the separation of children from their parents.  U.S. policy has targeted asylum seekers, most of them from the impoverished and violent Central American countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Now U.S. officials say they hope to speed up the processing of some asylum claims to just a few days, compared to the months or years it takes currently, in a shift that has raised concerns over due-process rights. Morgan and Perez confirmed they launched a pilot program in El Paso earlier this month, the Prompt Asylum Claim Review, first reported by the Washington Post last week.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L2N27E1G3	"By Ellen Wulfhorst WASHINGTON, Oct 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The United States could fight human trafficking effectively with more refined measuring tools which could distinguish young victims from old, or those trapped in domestic jobs from forced farm work, its top anti-trafficking official said on Tuesday. Ambassador-at-Large John Richmond, speaking after a top-level government anti-trafficking commission meeting, said targeted questions investigating slavery could expose detailed - and possibly more useful - results. Some 24.9 million people around the world are estimated to be victims of forced labor, working in factories or on building sites, farms and fishing boats, according to the United Nations' International Labour Organization. The ILO has called the estimate conservative. Counting and classifying people trapped in slavery in a targeted ""industry-specific and geographically restricted"" way could refine results, such as distinguishing boys trafficked for sex from adults trafficked into farming, Richmond explained. ""Instead of measuring how much trafficking is there in Kenya, ask the question 'How much forced labor victims are in the domestic workers' industry in metropolitan Nairobi?'"" he said by way of example. Diverse methods of measuring slavery would turn up ""a different set of questions, a different set of traffickers, a different set of victims, a different set of coercive means,"" Richmond said. ""I think we have some room to grow in terms of our ability, in terms of developing good methodologies around how to measure the prevalence of trafficking."" ""It would be really helpful as we move forward to figure out ... what programs are actually having an impact."" Richmond, who took up his post at the end of 2018, serves as Ambassador-at-Large and leads the State Department's anti-trafficking office. He spoke to reporters following a meeting of the President's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, a cabinet-level group started in 2000. Top government officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reported on progress and plans their departments and agencies have to fight human trafficking. Many detailed outreach and training efforts, plans to weed out forced labor in supply chains and support programs for survivors. The U.S. Congress approved an anti-trafficking program in 2017 which it has funded with $75 million so far, with the aim of measuring the prevalence of trafficking, Richmond said. ""My hope is just that more people would do studies and try different methodologies and test them against each other,"" he said. ""I think there are ways that we can improve and work in this area."" An estimated 400,000 people are believed to be trapped in modern slavery in the United States, according to the Global Slavery Index which is published by the human rights group Walk Free Foundation.

Baghdadi, who had led IS since 2010, detonated a suicide vest after being cornered in a raid by U.S. special forces in northwest Syria, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Sunday. Inspired by his edicts to enslave and slaughter Yazidis, whom IS regard as infidels, his followers shot, beheaded and kidnapped thousands in a rampage which the United Nations called a genocidal campaign against them. Along with thousands of other women and children, Jamila said she was enslaved by the militants and kept in captivity for five months in the city of Mosul along with her sister. She was just 14 when she was seized. But her problems did not end after she and her sister managed to escape when, she said, their guards were high on drugs. ""When I first came back, I had a nervous breakdown and psychological problems for two years, so I couldn't go to school,"" she said. Now instead of working or catching up on her years of lost schooling, she looks after her mother, with whom she shares her cramped tent at the camp. ""My mother can't walk and has health problems so I have to stay and take care of her because my older siblings are in Germany,"" she said.  NO PLANS TO GO HOME The prospect of going home to Sinjar in northern Iraq is not an option for Jamila, and many others. The city still lies in ruin four years after the IS onslaught, and suspicion runs deep in the ethnically mixed area. ""Sinjar is completely destroyed. Even if we could go back, I wouldn't want to because we'd be surrounded by the same Arab neighbours who all joined IS in the first place, and helped them kill us (Yazidis),"" she said. Thousands of men are being tried in Iraqi courts for their ties to IS. Iraq has so far not allowed victims to testify in court, something community leaders and human rights groups say would go a long way in the healing process. ""It is deplorable that not a single victim of Islamic State's horrific abuses including sexual slavery has gotten their day in court,"" said Belkis Wille, Iraq Researcher for Human Rights Watch. ""Iraq's justice system is designed to allow the state to exact mass revenge against suspects, not provide real accountability for victims."" For some of the nearly 17,000 Yazidis at the Sharya camp, Baghdadi's death was a first step in that direction though they fear the IS fighters who are still alive. Mayan Sinu, 25, can dream of a new life after the camp as she and her three children have been granted asylum by Australia. But she also wants the men who shot her husband in the legs and dragged him off to be brought to justice. He has been missing since the incident five years ago. ""I hope Baghdadi is suffering more than we ever did, and my God we suffered,"" said Sinu. ""I wish he (Baghdadi) hadn't blown himself up so I could have slaughtered him myself with my bare hands.""

The discovery of the bodies in a refrigerated truck on an industrial estate near London has shone a spotlight on the illicit trade that sends the poor of Asia, Africa and the Middle East on perilous journeys to the West. The 39 victims - 31 men and eight women - have yet to be identified but Vietnam said it was trying to accelerate the process. It fears many of the dead were its citizens. The bodies were found in the early hours of Oct. 23 after the container arrived in Britain from Zeebrugge in Belgium. The container was picked up at Purfleet dock, to the east of London, by a truck allegedly driven by Maurice Robinson, who is from Northern Ireland.  On Monday, Robinson, 25, appeared in court accused of manslaughter, money laundering, conspiracy to traffic people and conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration. For the two latter alleged offences, the charge sheet stated he had conspired with Ronan Hughes and others, prosecutors said. Police leading the investigation said Hughes, 40, and his brother Christopher, 34, from Armagh, were also wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L8N27E3FV	"By K. Sophie Will LONDON, Oct 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The discovery of 39 bodies in a truck in London last week cast a spotlight on the global trade in human beings and sparked debate about Britain's approach to tackling smugglers and traffickers. A British court heard on Monday that a global crime ring had been involved in smuggling the dead - many of whom appear to have come from Vietnam - as the driver of the truck faced charges of manslaughter and human trafficking. Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on Saturday told authorities to establish whether Vietnamese citizens were among the dead, and to probe allegations of trafficking. Unlike trafficking, which is control over a person for the purpose of exploitation, smuggling is merely illegal entry into another country - although the latter can turn into the former. About 10% of the suspected 7,000 slavery victims found in Britain last year were Vietnamese. Most are trafficked for labour such as cannabis cultivation and work in nail salons. Globally, more than 40 million people are estimated by the United Nations to be trapped in modern slavery as poverty, conflict and climate change fuel the $150-billion-a-year trade. The Thomson Reuters Foundation asked six anti-slavery experts about how to prevent such deaths from happening again. SARA THORNTON, BRITAIN'S INDEPENDENT ANTI-SLAVERY COMMISSIONER ""This is a shocking illustration of the cruel and complex issue that is human trafficking in Britain today. ""Whilst we do not yet know the full details of the journeys that these individuals made, this case bears all the hallmarks of human trafficking. ""As we rethink our migration policies, it is essential that the needs of vulnerable migrants are front and centre. ""We need to ensure that new migration policies are stress-tested to ensure that they do not provide opportunities for the traffickers to exploit very vulnerable people."" MIMI VU, INDEPENDENT ANTI-TRAFFICKING EXPERT IN VIETNAM ""The government and businesses must look at what the root causes are, realising that people that are less educated are more likely to take these risks because they are poor. ""All the work on this has to be done before anyone leaves, as this all has to be done in-country. ""When you address the root causes, you will convince the Vietnamese that this is not worth the risk. ""They have to believe in very concrete meaningful ways that they have a future in Vietnam. ""But we are losing our people to trafficking and slavery."" LUCILA GRANADA, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF FOCUS ON LABOUR EXPLOITATION ""We must, of course, investigate and punish those who profit from the desperation of people, but to effectively prevent this from happening again we must recognise the role of Britain in driving people into these dangerous routes. ""It is important to recognise that British immigration policies and border control approach have played a key part in restricting their options. ""With no available regular immigration pathways and the constant threat of detention and deportation in transit and upon arrival, those seeking survival in Britain become easy prey. ""This tragedy exposed one more time that prosecuting individual traffickers is not enough. We need to open safe routes of regular migration and end the hostile environment."" JUSTINE CURRELL, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF UNSEEN ""Whether people get into the back of a lorry through their own volition or from having been forced or coerced, the ultimate penalty is death. ""Even when trafficking and exploitation is not the primary factor of movement, those entering the country illegally and who lack status become increasingly vulnerable and susceptible to abuse and exploitation. ""Awareness-raising in communities and specific source countries to deter people from putting their lives at risk would help to highlight the pitfalls of taking this dangerous course of action. ""Increased targeted checks at the border may also help to root out such movement and any intervention subsequently made before another disaster occurs."" PHILIPPA SOUTHWELL, LAWYER AT BIRDS SOLICITORS ""Solving this is not simple, but obviously it's down to the manning of ports. I know it's difficult to check each vehicle, and it really is impossible to do one-to-one checking on these vehicles, but we can improve the manning of particular ports. ""Particularly in Asia, people living in poverty are promised a better life and are coming to Britain to work and send money back to their families. ""We need to be looking to build better relationships with these countries, realising what the root problems are there and what can be done."" NAZIR AFZAL, FORMER CHIEF PROSECUTOR IN NORTHERN ENGLAND ""Human trafficking is organised crime from which criminals benefit. ""Demand has to be reduced through deterrence, the closing down of businesses that engage trafficked people. Simultaneously, authorities need to follow the money and identify it, confiscate it, whilst punishing the offenders. ""Trafficked people need to be seen as victims first and last. They need to be supported to give their best evidence against the traffickers, not threatened with deportation."" (Reporting by K. Sophie Will, Writing by Kieran Guilbert, Editing by Katy Migiro.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_KBN1X71Y8	"By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. telecommunications regulator plans to vote in November to designate China's Huawei and ZTE as national security risks, barring their U.S. rural carrier customers from tapping an $8.5 billion government fund to purchase equipment or services. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) also plans to propose requiring those carriers to remove and replace equipment from such designated companies, FCC officials said on Monday. At a meeting set for Nov. 19, the FCC said it plans to vote to ask carriers how much it would cost to remove and replace Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] and ZTE Corp <000063.SZ> from existing networks and to establish a reimbursement program to offset the costs of removing the equipment. ""When it comes to 5G and America's security, we can't afford to take a risk and hope for the best,"" FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement. ""As the United States upgrades its networks to the next generation of wireless technologies - 5G - we cannot ignore the risk that the Chinese government will seek to exploit network vulnerabilities in order to engage in espionage, insert malware and viruses, and otherwise compromise our critical communications networks."" This is the latest in a series of actions by the U.S. government aimed at barring U.S. companies from purchasing Huawei and ZTE equipment. Huawei and ZTE would have 30 days to contest the FCC's national security risk designation and a final order compelling removal of equipment is not expected until next year at the earliest. ""In 30 years of business, Huawei has never had a major security-related incident in the 170 countries where we operate,"" said a Huawei spokesman in Shenzhen, China. ""Today's proposal, released by the FCC Chairman, only impacts the broadband providers in the most unserved or underserved rural areas of the United States,"" the spokesman said. ""Such action will further widen the digital divide; slowing the pace of economic development without further securing the Nation's telecommunications networks."" ZTE did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China was ""resolutely opposed"" to the United States putting such pressure on Chinese companies, which was ""economic bullying"" that went in the face of U.S. claims to follow the principles of a market economy. This decision would only harm U.S. consumers, especially in rural areas, which could be left without telecommunication services, he told a daily news briefing. ""I don't know what the U.S. view is on this risk,"" Geng added. The United States should stop trying to smear Chinese companies and provide them with a non-discriminatory environment in which to operate, he said.  'NEED TO BE MINDFUL' Pai first proposed in March 2018 to bar companies that posed a national security risk from receiving funds from the FCC's Universal Service Fund, but did not name Huawei or ZTE.

Several European countries in recent months have not agreed to bar Huawei, despite U.S. pressure. In May, Trump signed a long-awaited executive order declaring a national emergency and barring U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by companies posing a national security risk.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L2N27D11I	"(Adds Chinese Foreign Ministry comment) By David Shepardson WASHINGTON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. telecommunications regulator plans to vote in November to designate China's Huawei and ZTE as national security risks, barring their U.S. rural carrier customers from tapping an $8.5 billion government fund to purchase equipment or services. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) also plans to propose requiring those carriers to remove and replace equipment from such designated companies, FCC officials said on Monday. At a meeting set for Nov. 19, the FCC said it plans to vote to ask carriers how much it would cost to remove and replace Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and ZTE Corp from existing networks and to establish a reimbursement program to offset the costs of removing the equipment. ""When it comes to 5G and America's security, we can't afford to take a risk and hope for the best,"" FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement. ""As the United States upgrades its networks to the next generation of wireless technologies - 5G - we cannot ignore the risk that the Chinese government will seek to exploit network vulnerabilities in order to engage in espionage, insert malware and viruses, and otherwise compromise our critical communications networks."" This is the latest in a series of actions by the U.S. government aimed at barring U.S. companies from purchasing Huawei and ZTE equipment. Huawei and ZTE would have 30 days to contest the FCC's national security risk designation and a final order compelling removal of equipment is not expected until next year at the earliest. ""In 30 years of business, Huawei has never had a major security-related incident in the 170 countries where we operate,"" said a Huawei spokesman in Shenzhen, China. ""Today's proposal, released by the FCC Chairman, only impacts the broadband providers in the most unserved or underserved rural areas of the United States,"" the spokesman said. ""Such action will further widen the digital divide; slowing the pace of economic development without further securing the Nation's telecommunications networks."" ZTE did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China was ""resolutely opposed"" to the United States putting such pressure on Chinese companies, which was ""economic bullying"" that went in the face of U.S. claims to follow the principles of a market economy. This decision would only harm U.S. consumers, especially in rural areas, which could be left without telecommunication services, he told a daily news briefing. ""I don't know what the U.S. view is on this risk,"" Geng added. The United States should stop trying to smear Chinese companies and provide them with a non-discriminatory environment in which to operate, he said.  'NEED TO BE MINDFUL' Pai first proposed in March 2018 to bar companies that posed a national security risk from receiving funds from the FCC's Universal Service Fund, but did not name Huawei or ZTE. The fund provides subsidies to provide service in rural or hard-to-reach areas, and to libraries and schools. FCC Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel noted the move comes after 18 months of review and the FCC should take additional action. ""We need to be mindful that in a global economy, our networks will still connect to insecure equipment abroad. So we should start researching how we can build networks that can withstand connection to equipment vulnerabilities around the world,"" Rosenworcel said. The FCC argued the companies' ties to the Chinese government and military apparatus, and Chinese laws requiring that such companies assist the Chinese government with intelligence activities, pose a U.S. national security risk. Congress has been considering legislation to authorize up to $1 billion for small and rural wireless providers to replace network equipment from the Chinese companies. The FCC could tap the fund itself to pay for replacing equipment if Congress does not act.

A UK court heard on Monday that a global ring had been involved in smuggling the group. The truck's driver is facing charges of manslaughter and people trafficking. ""The nationality of the victims hasn't been officially confirmed yet,"" Cuong said on the sidelines of a conference in the northern-central town of Vinh. Vietnam and Britain ""are trying to speed up identification of the bodies, but no deadline has been set,"" he said. On Monday, Vietnam's government said British police had sent documents regarding four of the victims to Hanoi for further verification. The discovery of the bodies last week on an industrial estate near London has shone a spotlight on the illicit trade that sends the poor of Asia, Africa and the Middle East on perilous journeys to the West In Vietnam, poor job prospects, encouragement by authorities, smuggling gangs, environmental disasters and government pressure on Catholics are all local factors behind the wave of migrants. The desire to go overseas has created a thriving underground market in the Southeast Asian country for people smugglers, many of whom promise safe and even ""VIP"" packages for secret travel to Europe, anti-trafficking experts, migrants and their family members have told Reuters. News of the tragedy has plunged the rural provinces of Nghe An and Ha Tinh in northern-central Vietnam into despair, with many families fearing loved ones may be among the dead. Authorities in Nghe An have launched an appeal for concerned family members to submit copies of photos and identification of the missing to their local People's Committee for verification, according to a copy of the appeal seen by Reuters. Vietnam's foreign ministry has so far received information from 14 concerned families seeking missing family members in the UK, the ministry said in a statement late on Monday. Communist-ruled Vietnam is extremely sensitive to events which could lead to social unrest or public gatherings. A candlelit ceremony outside a Catholic cathedral in Hanoi in memory of the 39 victims was broken up by police on Sunday, organisers said. The propaganda department of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party has instructed local media chiefs not to report or speculate on the nationality or identity of the victims without confirmation from Hanoi's foreign ministry, according to a copy of the instruction seen by Reuters. ""Please be considerate and cautious,"" the instruction said.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N27D3DW	"(Adds details from blog, background) Oct 28 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said it has tracked ""significant"" cyberattacks coming from a group it calls ""Strontium"" or ""Fancy Bear"", targeting anti-doping authorities and global sporting organizations. The group, also called APT28, has been linked to the Russian government, Microsoft said in a blog post. (https://bit.ly/2Ni6LMp) At least 16 national and international sporting and anti-doping organizations across three continents were targeted in the attacks which began on Sept. 16, according to the company. The company said some of these attacks had been successful, but the majority had not. Microsoft has notified all customers targeted in these attacks. Strontium, one of the world's oldest cyber espionage groups, has also been called Sofancy and Pawn Storm by a range of security firms and government officials. Security firm CrowdStrike has said the group may be associated with the Russian military intelligence agency GRU. Microsoft said Strontium reportedly released medical records and emails taken from sporting organizations and anti-doping officials in 2016 and 2018, resulting in an indictment in a federal court in the United States in 2018. The software giant added that the methods used in the most recent attacks were similar to those used by Strontium to target governments, militaries, think-tanks, law firms, human rights organizations, financial firms and universities around the world. Strontium's methods include spear-phishing, password spray, exploiting internet-connected devices and the use of both open-source and custom malware, it added. Microsoft has in the past taken legal steps o prevent Strontium from using fake Microsoft internet domains to execute its attacks. By August last year, Microsoft had shut down 84 fake websites in 12 court-approved actions over the past two years. (https://reut.rs/2JsrjjW) Microsoft said at the time that hackers linked to Russia's government sought to launch cyber attacks on U.S. political groups.

The job of mayor is regarded as the most powerful political post in Colombia after the presidency, and at least nine other openly LGBT+ people were elected to local positions, double the number from the last regional elections in 2015. During her campaign, the left-wing former senator and presidential candidate did not focus on LGBT+ rights or her sexuality. Instead Lopez pledged to fight all forms of discrimination and inequality suffered by Colombians in the capital city of seven million people, particularly the high levels of violence against women and children, and to improve access to education. ""Bogota voted so that through citizen culture, quality education and equality we will defeat, overcome and unlearn machismo, racism, classism, homophobia and xenophobia,"" Lopez said during her acceptance speech on Sunday evening. Her victory shows progress for the political participation of LGBT+ people and for others who have been sidelined or discriminated in the past, said Wilson Castaneda, head of the Colombian LGBT+ rights group Caribe Afirmativo. ""It's a guarantee that Claudia will defend equality, the equal rights we've achieved, and that equality isn't up for discussion,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""Her victory sends a message that sexual, political and or religious diversity aren't impediments to participate in politics."" According to Caribe Afirmativo, this was the first election of an openly gay woman as mayor of a capital city in the Americas. Lopez, who has built a reputation as an anti-corruption fighter, will take office on January 1, 2020. A photo of Lopez, 49, kissing her partner, Colombian Sen. Angelica Lozano, as they celebrated her victory was widely circulated on social media. ""Claudia's election opens up new horizons for LGBT+ people across Latin America,"" said Matt Beard, executive director of international LGBT+ rights group All Out. ""As the first openly LGBT+ mayor of a capital city in the region, her election sets the foundation for the LGBT+ community ... to aspire to and achieve positions of political leadership, including the very highest office."" Parts of South America have made progress on LGBT+ rights in the past decade, including passing laws allowing same-sex couples to marry and adopt children. But less progress has been made on increasing the participation of LGBT+ people as elected officials in local and central government.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L8N27D2LA	"By Naimul Karim DHAKA, Oct 28 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Bangladesh's High Court has ordered the government to explain why it has not made more provision for breastfeeding mothers in public spaces and workplaces, saying a failure to do so may be unconstitutional. The court said the government's failure to ensure proper provision for breastfeeding could violate ""the right to life"", giving it four weeks to respond. ""If you can allocate spaces for smoking, why can't you have rooms for breastfeeding. It won't cost much,"" said lawyer Ishrat Hassan, who filed the petition that led to the court's ruling. Kamrun Nahar, a senior women's ministry official, said it was already government policy to create breastfeeding rooms, which already existed in several of places. But the court said they should be in private shopping malls, airports, bus stands and railway stations, also calling for childcare provision in work places. Hassan said she realised the need for such spaces when her own baby started crying when she was at an airport. ""There was nowhere I could go to. I felt helpless. In the end, I requested the security to let me use the enclosure where they screen female passenger to feed my child,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Mothers@Work, a United Nations-backed initiative to support maternity rights and promote breastfeeding in Bangladesh's garment industry, has said companies face high levels of dropout and absenteeism among new mothers on the workforce. Only about one in four Bangladeshi women of working age is employed - a higher proportion than in neighbouring India, thanks largely to the large numbers working in garment factories, but lower than China, Indonesia and the Philippines. ""In terms of living in a safe or friendly environment for women, we are definitely behind,"" said Maleka Banu, general secretary of the Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, a women's rights group. The court did not say what its next steps would be. But it has the power to direct the government to act - and Hassan said she was confident it would do so.

The discovery of the bodies last week in a refrigerated truck on an industrial estate near London has shone a spotlight on the illicit trade that sends the poor of Asia, Africa and the Middle East on perilous journeys to the West. The truck's driver, Maurice Robinson, appeared in Chelmsford Magistrates' Court via video link. The 25-year-old, wearing a gray sweatshirt, spoke only to confirm his name, address and British nationality.  Robinson faces 43 charges in all - 39 counts of manslaughter as well as accusations of conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration, and money laundering. ""This involves a global ring facilitating the movement of a large number of immigrants into the UK,"" prosecution lawyer Ogheneruona Mercy Iguyovwe told the court. She said other suspects were still being sought.  Robinson did not apply for bail. He was remanded in custody until Nov. 25, when the case will continue at the Old Bailey, London's Central Criminal Court, and he will enter a plea. He was arrested shortly after the bodies were found near the English port of Purfleet. The shipping container they were in had traveled from Zeebrugge in Belgium.  'HOPING FOR A BETTER LIFE' ""The whole nation and indeed the world has been shocked by this tragedy, and the cruelty of the fate that has been suffered by innocent people who were hoping for a better life in this country,"" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wrote in a book of condolences.

Many of the dead appear to have come from Vietnam's northern rice-growing areas of Nghe An and Ha Tinh, two of its poorest provinces. ""If I could travel back in time, I wouldn't have let him go this way,"" said Hoang Thi Ai, mother of Hoang Van Tiep, 18, who is feared to be among the dead. ""I clean his room every day with the hope that he wasn't in that deadly truck."" Police have said few of the victims were carrying official identification, and that they are resorting to fingerprints, dental records, DNA and photographs from friends and relatives. Vietnam said Britain had sent dossiers seeking help in identifying four of the bodies. Deputy Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son said Vietnam was still unable to confirm the nationality of any of the victims.  'MY CHILD WAS SCAMMED' Bui Thi Nhung, 19, is believed by her family to be one of the dead. They said she had left Nghe An in August, making her way from China to Germany, then Belgium, where they believe she entered the container. About 70 percent of Vietnamese trafficking cases in Britain between 2009 and 2016 were for labor exploitation, including cannabis production and work in nail salons, Britain said last year. A report last March by the Pacific Links Foundation, a U.S.-based anti-trafficking organization, identified Nghe An as home to many victims of human trafficking who end up in Europe. The other province, Ha Tinh, was ravaged in 2016 by one of Vietnam's worst environmental disasters when a steel mill owned by Taiwan's Formosa Plastics contaminated coastal waters, devastating fishing and tourism.

Robinson faces 43 charges in all - 39 counts of manslaughter as well as accusations of conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration, and money laundering. ""This involves a global ring facilitating the movement of a large number of immigrants into the UK,"" prosecution lawyer Ogheneruona Mercy Iguyovwe told the court. She said other suspects were still being sought. Robinson did not apply for bail. He was remanded in custody until Nov. 25, when the case will continue at the Old Bailey, London's Central Criminal Court, and he will enter a plea. He was arrested shortly after the bodies were found near the English port of Purfleet. The shipping container they were in had travelled from Zeebrugge in Belgium.  'HOPING FOR A BETTER LIFE' ""The whole nation and indeed the world has been shocked by this tragedy, and the cruelty of the fate that has been suffered by innocent people who were hoping for a better life in this country,"" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wrote in a book of condolences. Interior minister Priti Patel told parliament the investigation would unravel ""criminality that could stretch half way across the world"". Many of the dead appear to have come from Vietnam's northern rice-growing areas of Nghe An and Ha Tinh, two of its poorest provinces. ""If I could travel back in time, I wouldn't have let him go this way,"" said Hoang Thi Ai, mother of Hoang Van Tiep, 18, who is feared to be among the dead. ""I clean his room every day with the hope that he wasn't in that deadly truck."" Police have said few of the victims were carrying official identification, and that they are resorting to fingerprints, dental records, DNA and photographs from friends and relatives. Vietnam said Britain had sent dossiers seeking help in identifying four of the bodies. Deputy Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son said Vietnam was still unable to confirm the nationality of any of the victims.  'MY CHILD WAS SCAMMED' Bui Thi Nhung, 19, is believed by her family to be one of the dead. They said she had left Nghe An in August, making her way from China to Germany, then Belgium, where they believe she entered the container. About 70 percent of Vietnamese trafficking cases in Britain between 2009 and 2016 were for labour exploitation, including cannabis production and work in nail salons, Britain said last year. A report last March by the Pacific Links Foundation, a U.S.-based anti-trafficking organisation, identified Nghe An as home to many victims of human trafficking who end up in Europe. The other province, Ha Tinh, was ravaged in 2016 by one of Vietnam's worst environmental disasters when a steel mill owned by Taiwan's Formosa Plastics contaminated coastal waters, devastating fishing and tourism. Tiep's mother said she believed her son had been tricked into travelling to Britain, since he had made it to France when he was 16 and settled down. ""One day he hastily asked us to raise 100 million dong ($4,300) for his trip,"" Ai said, sitting with family members in their house in Dien Chau district of Nghe An province. ""My child was scammed. The guy who helped him organise the journey to the UK said the 'VIP' service was very safe, commuting in four-seat car - not that container.""

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26E03F	"By Hannah McNeish LAMU, Kenya, Oct 28 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Fishing communities on Kenya's north coast will be the first to benefit from ""smart"" identity cards aimed at distinguishing genuine fishermen and loggers from poachers who raid waters and cut down mangroves vital to ease climate change threats. Each government-issued Mvuvi card - the word means ""fisher"" in Swahili - features a photo and fingerprint taken from its registered owner. Authorities will be able to read the cards using smartphones loaded with communications software that allows short-range wireless data transfers. Officials hope the cards, being used first in Lamu County, home to what the government says are about 60% of Kenya's protected mangrove forests, will boost security and curb illegal fishing and logging. ""There are people who pretend to be fishermen going out to sea but they are doing illegal logging of the mangroves,"" Samson Macharia, commissioner of Lamu County, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a telephone interview. ""Over-harvesting of mangroves will affect (impacts from) climate change and ecosystems all along the shores of the coast and the islands,"" he added. Environmental scientists have long stressed the important role mangrove forests play in reducing global warming threats. Mangroves are far more effective at absorbing and storing carbon dioxide - one of the major drivers of climate change - than trees on land, they say. The trees' roots also trap and hold sediment, providing a coastal buffer against storms and protection from floods, as well as creating an important fish breeding ground. More than 35% of the world's mangroves are already gone and they are disappearing three to five times faster than other forests, according to international conservation group WWF. Figures published by Kenya's Ministry of Environment and Forestry show that the country lost about 20% of its mangroves between 1985 and 2009. Of the mangroves that remain, an estimated 40% are degraded. ""In the mangroves, we have witnessed 'die-back', which is mangroves just drying up,"" said John Bett, who works on sustainable forestry for WWF-Kenya. Bett said he has seen the effects of climate change in Lamu County gather pace in the last 10 to 15 years and that the rate of mangrove regeneration, which can occur naturally as seeds fall from trees onto the mud, has ""slowed down dramatically"". Only loggers registered with Kenya's Forestry Service are allowed to cut mangroves in Lamu County and only within certain quotas and areas, he explained. But without knowing who exactly is on the water, cracking down on those fishing or logging mangroves illegally has been a challenge, he stressed.  SALTIER LAND, EMPTIER SEAS Coastal communities in Kenya are already struggling with the effects of climate change. Globally, scientists have warned that water temperatures are increasing far faster than expected due to carbon emissions. As oceans warm, they expand, driving rising sea levels which, along with more erratic weather, make farmland increasingly vulnerable to flooding and failed harvests. Hotter seas also fuel more powerful cyclones and other storms, which can drive saltwater onto land. With fewer mangrove forests to buffer coastal land, soil is becoming salty - which kills crops - and or is being washed away by heavy rains, scientists say. Warming oceans also threaten fish, especially in areas such as Kenya that have experienced coral bleaching. ""Fishermen report that some of the species are disappearing because of the increase of temperatures and the damaged corals and increasing bleaching, so you find breeding areas have reduced drastically,"" said Bett of the WWF. Bett has seen local fishermen become poorer and more desperate, with some taking bigger risks to net increasingly smaller catches. Others haven given up fishing entirely, he said. ""We have witnessed decreased stocks, so fishermen are now going further, beyond the reefs they are used to, whereas 10 to 15 years ago they would just fish near the reefs,"" he said. Bett also noted that local fishermen using traditional methods and small wooden boats struggle to compete with foreign vessels that fish using more modern gear. SECURITY QUESTIONS Funded by the European Union and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Mvuvi card project originally launched in 2018, with a pilot phase that handed out 250 cards to fishermen on Kiwayu Island in Lamu County. Those cards were eventually canceled due to the discovery of security gaps in the system, explained Mathenge Ndungu, programme manager of the Kiunga Youth Bunge Initiative (KYBI). The local civil society group is in charge of finding and registering fishermen for the card. The group is now working with the government to strengthening the security of participants' personal information and is in discussions over allocating space on the government's servers to store that database, Ndungu said. In the meantime, KYBI has registered 700 fishermen and hopes to issue them all with cards by the end of the month. ""We are targeting 1,000 fishermen to be issued with cards in the first phase,"" said Ndungu. The hope, he said, is that the Mvuvi card will succeed in protecting a fishing industry already severely stressed by the combination of climate change, poaching and mangrove loss. Ali Tewa, 34, who comes from Kiwayu, started fishing when he left school at 16 and remembers a time when the fish were plentiful in the waters around Lamu County. ""Back then, in the 1990s, you could go (out) for between half an hour and three hours to catch around 200 kilogrammes (440 pounds) of fish,"" he said. ""Now, you can go a whole day without catching any."" (Reporting by Hannah McNeish; Editing by Jumana Farouky and Laurie Goering.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_KBN1X70S9	"By Martin Petty and Rozanna Latiff MANILA/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Southeast Asian countries fighting Islamic State's influence in the region lauded the killing of its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi but said security forces were preparing for a long battle to thwart the jihadist group's ideology. The Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia, home to some of Asia's most organized Islamist militants, said on Monday they were braced for retaliation by Islamic State loyalists, including ""lone wolf"" attacks by locals radicalized by the group's powerful online propaganda. Baghdadi killed himself in a tunnel in northwest Syria by detonating a suicide vest as U.S. forces closed in, according to U.S. President Donald Trump. Though his death will unsettle Islamic State, it remains capable and dangerous, said Delfin Lorenzana, defense secretary of the Philippines, where the group's influence has taken a hold among unschooled Muslim youth in its troubled Mindanao region. ""This is a blow to the organization considering al-Baghdadi's stature as a leader. But this is just a momentary setback considering the depth and reach of the organization worldwide,"" Lorenzana said. ""Somebody will take his place."" Southeast Asia has long been an important focus for Islamic State, which has inspired Islamist militants in West Africa, across the Middle East and Asia and through to Indonesia and the Philippines.  The Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia are concerned Islamic State supporters from the region and those fleeing Iraq and Syria could exploit the porous borders, lawlessness and abundant arms found in Mindanao to take refuge in its far-flung villages. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for four suicide bombings since July last year in the Philippines, which fought its toughest battle since World War Two in 2017 when extremists seeking to establish an Islamic State laid siege to Marawi City and occupied it through five months of air and ground assaults. Fighters from at least seven countries took part, including Malaysia, which remains on high alert and has arrested 400 people suspected of links to militant groups. Malaysian police counter-terrorism chief Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay said the real concern was not Islamic State's leadership but the effect of its teachings. ""It's good news, but his death will have little impact here as the main problem remains the spread of the Islamic State ideology,"" he told Reuters. ""What we are most worried about now are 'lone wolf' attacks and those who are self-radicalized through the internet. We are still seeing the spread of IS teachings online. IS publications and magazines from years ago are being reproduced and re-shared,"" he said.  'JIHAD WILL NEVER STOP' Chatrooms in messaging applications used by Islamists such as Telegram showed defiant messages about Baghdadi's death, according to a researcher who monitors activity by Islamic State sympathizers. ""God Willing, whatever happens, Islamic jihad will not rely on any one individual, but will always stand tall on the orders of God and His Prophet,"" read one posting under the handle Ansurul Ummah. Another participant, Abu Abdullah Asy Syami, posted: ""Jihad will never stop, even if our own caliph dies."" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison made a similar observation, and said Baghdadi's death was by no means the end. ""This is a many-headed monster ... As you cut one off, another one inevitably arises,"" he told reporters. Indonesia, the world's biggest Muslim-majority country, is grappling with a resurgence in militancy and has detained hundreds of suspects this year under tightened anti-terrorism laws.  Authorities believe thousands of Indonesians draw inspiration from Islamic State and about 500 are thought to have joined the group in Syria.  Indonesia's intelligence agency said it was ready for retaliation and though Baghdadi's death would be a psychological blow, Islamic State would have a successor in place.    ""It is a war. Usually, there must be a counterattack or the like. When it comes to security, we are sure that we will secure this country,"" said its spokesman, Wawan Purwanto. Security analyst Rommel Banlaoi said Baghdadi's demise and uncertainty about the leadership could undermine operations of Islamic State loyalists seeking to regroup and establish their own territory in Southeast Asia. ""Pro-ISIS groups in the Philippines will surely re-examine their roles in the post-Baghdadi era,"" he said.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L1N27C0C9	"BOGOTA, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Voters in Colombia's capital Bogota elected a woman as mayor for the first time on Sunday in local and regional contests marked in some places by violence against candidates and the power of political clans. Left-wing Claudia Lopez, a former senator and vice-presidential candidate, won about 35% of the vote for Bogota  mayor, widely considered the second-most important political post in Colombia after the presidency. Advertising herself as ""incorruptible"", Lopez promised to put more police officers on the streets to improve safety, to fight child labor and teenage pregnancy and to expand educational opportunities for adults over 45. About 36.6 million people were eligible to vote for 32 governors, more than 1,000 mayors and thousands of regional and local legislative positions. At 6 p.m. local time (2300 GMT), results showed about half of those eligible had voted. Despite hiccups at some of the country's 11,590 polling places - including landslides that delayed the start of voting at three locations - Sunday's vote was the most peaceful of recent local and regional elections, the head of the national registry office said. ""They have been the most peaceful territorial elections in recent years, they have been territorial elections where Colombians have been able to vote in all polling places,"" Juan Carlos Galindo told reporters shortly after voting ended at 4 P.M. local time (2100 GMT). The outcome of other races was likely to reflect the power of political families rather than parties, analysts told Reuters ahead of the voting, especially as many candidates are backed by coalitions. It is not unusual for disparate factions to unite behind candidates for local elections in Colombia, giving local power-brokers more sway with eventual 2022 presidential contenders to negotiate benefits for their areas. The mayorship of the Caribbean port city of Barranquilla went to Jaime Pumarejo, backed by powerful political kingmakers, the Char family. Nicolas Petro, son of left-wing 2018 presidential candidate Gustavo Petro, was in a distant second for the governorship of Atlantico province. Petro's pick for Bogota mayor came in third with around 14% of the vote, less than 1% ahead of the candidate backed by President Ivan Duque's right-wing Democratic Center party. During campaigning seven candidates were killed, a dozen attacked and more than 100 threatened, the Electoral Observation Mission (MOE), a voting rights group, has said. Five candidates were killed in the last round of regional elections in 2015.

In Brussels she sipped sugary bubble tea and posed on the steps of the old stock exchange. To anyone else, she was another tourist. But Vietnamese 19-year-old Bui Thi Nhung, whose family believe she was one of the 39 people found dead in a refrigerated truck near London on Wednesday, it was the make-or-break trip of a lifetime. ""Being grown up means having to hide your sadness in the dark, and keeping a smile on your face,"" Nhung wrote in an Oct. 21 Facebook post, days before her family lost contact with her and the news of the doomed shipping container emerged. From interviews with her family, and a series of messages left on her social media accounts, Reuters has pieced together the last movements of one of the young Vietnamese migrants thought by relatives to be among the dead. Nhung was from Nghe An, a poor province 300 km (190 miles) south of Hanoi, Vietnam's rapidly developing capital.  On Saturday evening, Catholic priest Anthony Dang Huu Nam led around 500 worshippers in prayers for the dead as they held lit candles in the modest, white-walled church in Yen Thanh, Nhung's hometown. Many have made the same fateful journey. Britain's ambassador to Vietnam wrote in an opinion piece published last month by local papers that the dangers were clear. ""In recent years, hundreds of potential Vietnamese victims of trafficking have been identified in the UK,"" Ambassador Gareth Ward wrote in the Sept. 29 column. ""There are cases of illegal immigrants suffering injuries when being chased. There are cases of death due to extreme cold, lack of oxygen inside lorries. Many never even set foot in the 'promised land',"" Ward wrote, referring to guarantees made by Vietnamese people smugglers to resettle migrants in Britain. Nhung's family said she first left Nghe An on her journey overseas in August. She went to China first, before eventually making her way to Germany, then Belgium, where they believe she  boarded the fated truck.  Officials in Britain have not yet identified the dead. ""I just want a peaceful life,"" Nhung wrote in a caption beneath a photo of her smiling in a green field a few weeks after leaving Vietnam. ""The happiest thing in life is finding someone who doesn't abandon you during your hardest time,"" she said, on Aug. 27.  'LIVING FREELY' Late on Saturday night, Nhung's family, devoid of hope, set up an altar in her memory, with her photo next to her father's. Her father died of cancer a few years ago. Her mother was unable to work because of health complications and so her loved ones clubbed together to finance a new life overseas, Nhung's family told Reuters. ""Nhung didn't have the qualifications to get a good job with handsome pay. Nor do her friends and many others here,"" said Nhung's uncle, Hoang Binh. ""Going abroad and sending back money was the only choice,"" he added. It was not clear what sort of work was lined up for Nhung. Some 70% of Vietnamese trafficking cases in the UK between 2009 and 2016 were for labor exploitation, including cannabis production and work in nail bars, according to a British government report last year. ""Women and girls from rural areas are also considered more susceptible to trafficking,"" the report said. By early September, it was not clear where she was, but Nhung was already well into her trip, and reflecting on her next steps. Beside a stock image of two children flying kites at sunset, she posted:  ""As I grow up, I see that life is not as peaceful as I used to think. When I grow up, I want to go back to my childhood, when I lived freely"".  PINK TO BLACK In one of her first pictures more clearly taken from the start of her adventure in Europe, Nhung posed in front of a German beer garden. Days later, in late September, she posted photos of Vietnamese noodle dishes she said she had cooked for friends in Berlin. ""If anyone wants to buy one, I'll ship it to you,"" she joked in the Facebook post. Ton Quang Tuan, one of Nhung's friends living in Berlin, said that ""We went out a few times when Nhung was in Berlin"" and added that ""she was in a good mood, very happy,"" but they lost contact after she said she had to leave for Britain. It was not clear how Nhung had traveled from the Vietnamese countryside to China and then Berlin, but the German capital has emerged in recent years as a staging ground for Vietnamese and other migrants looking to start new lives in Britain. ""I feel lonely in the place I used to dream of everyday,"" Nhung wrote on Sept. 25.  It was unclear where she was - Vietnamese smugglers are said to advise their subjects to live discreetly and not to give away too many clues in order to evade detection from the authorities. ""I don't know when I can get used to my current life, but I do know one thing for sure. At this moment, I miss you dad. I miss you like crazy."" A few days later, Nhung was pictured outside Berlin Cathedral with a cup of bubble tea in her hands. The sweetened, milky tea filled with balls of chewy jelly is hugely popular amongst Vietnamese youth. By late October, Nhung was in Belgium. She posted photos of herself, again with a cup of bubble tea in her hand, excitedly exploring the sights of Brussels, including the old stock exchange and the bustling Rue Auguste Orts thoroughfare. It was from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge that the doomed container eventually departed. Her family believe that she was on board. In Berlin, Nhung wrote: ""Back in Vietnam, I thought Europe was pink"". ""But it turns out it's black"".

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_KBN1X60AU	"CAN LOC, Vietnam (Reuters) - Police in Vietnam took hair and blood samples on Sunday to get DNA from relatives of people feared to be among the 39 who died in the back of a truck near London last week, their family members said. The bodies were found on Wednesday in a truck container in Grays, about 32 km (20 miles) east of central London and British police are still trying to establish the identity of victims who in many cases lacked identity documents. In a poor rice-growing area of northern Vietnam, communities have been plunged into mourning with their hope all but lost for relatives who had set out to seek better lives in Europe and were thought to have been aboard the truck. The hashtag #RIP39 was trending in Vietnam on widely-used Facebook. Distraught, Nguyen Dinh Gia said he feared there was very little chance he would ever again see his 20-year-old son, Nguyen Dinh Luong, who had been trying to get to Britain after first making it to France. ""Police from the Ministry of Public Security came to get DNA samples, our hair and blood,"" Nguyen Dinh Gia told Reuters at Can Loc in Ha Tinh province, where sympathizers gathered at the simple house amid lush rice fields to console the family. ""I advised him not to go because I told him that even though our family had always had nothing and our children were always in hardship, but we brought them up just fine,"" Nguyen said. The father of Pham Thi Tra My, who sent a last text message to her family in the early hours of Wednesday Vietnam time, said police had also been to collect samples of blood and hair. Vietnam's government did not respond immediately for a request for comment. Vietnam's prime minister has called for an investigation into the case. Police in Britain said on Saturday they had charged one man, 25-year-old Maurice Robinson of Craigavon in Northern Ireland, with 39 counts of manslaughter and other offences including conspiracy to traffic people. On Sunday, police said three people arrested in connection with the investigation had been released on bail. All three had been questioned on suspicion of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people. Initially, British police believed the victims were Chinese, but later sought help from the Vietnamese community. Chinese and Vietnamese officials were both working closely with British police, the countries' embassies said.  A Catholic priest in the remote town of Yen Thanh in Nghe An province said on Saturday that he believed most of the dead were likely from Vietnam.  NO DOCUMENTS British police have said very few of the victims were carrying official identification and that they hope to identify the dead through fingerprints, dental records and DNA, as well as photos from friends and relatives. In the predominantly Catholic area of northern Vietnam from which the suspected victims came, churches held candle-lit prayers at the weekend. How the victims came to be in the truck is not yet known. Some 70% of Vietnamese trafficking cases in the United Kingdom between 2009-2016 were for labor exploitation, including cannabis production and work in nail salons, according to a British government report last year. The families of the suspected victims were in Nghe An and Ha Tinh, two of the poorest provinces in communist Vietnam. Nghe An was identified as home to many victims of human trafficking who end up in Europe, according to a March report by the Pacific Links Foundation, a U.S.-based anti-trafficking organization.  Ha Tinh was ravaged by one of Vietnam's worst environmental disasters in 2016 when a steel mill owned by Taiwan's Formosa Plastics contaminated coastal waters, devastating local fishing and tourism industries. It was from Ha Tinh that Tra My set out, first to China, in the hope of making it to Britain via France. According to Human Rights Space, a civic network based in Vietnam, she sent one final apologetic message home. ""I'm sorry, mum and dad. My path abroad was not a success. I love you both so much. I can’t breathe. I'm from Nghen Town, Can Loc District, Ha Tinh, Vietnam ... I am sorry, mum,"" the message said.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_KBN1X60DH	"By Philip Pullella VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Sunday called for an end to the plundering of the Amazon basin, as he closed an assembly of Roman Catholic bishops who discussed the challenges the Church faces in the region. The work of the assembly, known as a synod, ended on Saturday night with a final document containing a proposal that married men in the remote area be allowed to be ordained as priests. The milestone proposal could lead to a landmark change in the Church's centuries-old discipline of celibacy. One of the other themes of the three-week synod was the environmental protection of the Amazon and respect for its indigenous peoples and their cultures. In his sermon at a closing Mass in St. Peter's Basilica, Francis criticised those who consider indigenous people ""backward and of little worth"" instead of acknowledging what their cultures can teach others. ""They despise their traditions, erase their history, occupy their lands, and usurp their goods. How much alleged superiority, transformed into oppression and exploitation, exists even today!"" he said. ""The mistakes of the past were not enough to stop the plundering of other persons and the inflicting of wounds on our brothers and sisters and on our sister Earth: we have seen it in the scarred face of the Amazon region,"" he said.  The synod's final document warned of the risks to the Amazon basin from mining and deforestation, which scientists say increases the threat of global warming.  The bishops proposed that the Church define what would constitute the ""ecological sin"" of harming the environment and also introduce specific ministries for the care of nature. The pope will consider the proposals, including an expanded role for women, in writing his own document, known as an Apostolic Exhortation. He said he hopes to have it ready by the end of the year. At the Mass, attended by indigenous people from the Amazon, Francis also appeared to take a swipe at conservatives who have attacked parts of the synod's working document as heretical. Opponents of Francis, inspired by the writings of two cardinals, held several side events during the synod. They took particular umbrage at the use of an indigenous statue of a pregnant woman at an opening event, saying that was pagan. The pope asked forgiveness for what he considered an insult to the indigenous after ultra-conservative Catholic militants stole replicas of the statue and dumped them into the Tiber River.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L4N27B04K	"By James Pearson and Phuong Nguyen HANOI, Oct 26 (Reuters) - In Berlin she posed outside a beer garden, a beaming smile upon her face. In Brussels she sipped sugary bubble tea and posed on the steps of the old stock exchange. To anyone else, she was another tourist. But Vietnamese 19-year-old Bui Thi Nhung, whose family believe she was one of the 39 people found dead in a refrigerated truck near London on Wednesday, it was the make-or-break trip of a lifetime. ""Being grown up means having to hide your sadness in the dark, and keeping a smile on your face,"" Nhung wrote in an Oct. 21 Facebook post, days before her family lost contact with her and the news of the doomed shipping container emerged. From interviews with her family, and a series of messages left on her social media accounts, Reuters has pieced together the last movements of one of the young Vietnamese migrants thought by relatives to be among the dead. Nhung was from Nghe An, a poor province 300 km (190 miles) south of Hanoi, Vietnam's rapidly developing capital. On Saturday evening, Catholic priest Anthony Dang Huu Nam led around 500 worshippers in prayers for the dead as they held lit candles in the modest, white-walled church in Yen Thanh, Nhung's hometown. Many have made the same fateful journey. Britain's ambassador to Vietnam wrote in an opinion piece published last month by local papers that the dangers were clear. ""In recent years, hundreds of potential Vietnamese victims of trafficking have been identified in the UK,"" Ambassador Gareth Ward wrote in the Sept. 29 column. ""There are cases of illegal immigrants suffering injuries when being chased. There are cases of death due to extreme cold, lack of oxygen inside lorries. Many never even set foot in the 'promised land',"" Ward wrote, referring to guarantees made by Vietnamese people smugglers to resettle migrants in Britain. Nhung's family said she first left Nghe An on her journey overseas in August. She went to China first, before eventually making her way to Germany, then Belgium, where they believe she boarded the fated truck. Officials in Britain have not yet identified the dead. ""I just want a peaceful life,"" Nhung wrote in a caption beneath a photo of her smiling in a green field a few weeks after leaving Vietnam. ""The happiest thing in life is finding someone who doesn't abandon you during your hardest time,"" she said, on Aug. 27.  'LIVING FREELY' Late on Saturday night, Nhung's family, devoid of hope, set up an altar in her memory, with her photo next to her father's. Her father died of cancer a few years ago. Her mother was unable to work because of health complications and so her loved ones clubbed together to finance a new life overseas, Nhung's family told Reuters. ""Nhung didn't have the qualifications to get a good job with handsome pay. Nor do her friends and many others here,"" said Nhung's uncle, Hoang Binh. ""Going abroad and sending back money was the only choice,"" he added. It was not clear what sort of work was lined up for Nhung. Some 70% of Vietnamese trafficking cases in the UK between 2009 and 2016 were for labour exploitation, including cannabis production and work in nail bars, according to a British government report last year. ""Women and girls from rural areas are also considered more susceptible to trafficking,"" the report said.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_KBN1X503U	"YEN THANH, Vietnam (Reuters) - Several townships in rural Vietnam sank into mourning on Saturday, with communities believing that many of the 39 people found dead in the back of a truck near London this week came from poor, rice-growing areas of the country. The bodies were discovered on Wednesday after emergency services were alerted to people in a truck container on an industrial site in Grays, about 32 km (20 miles) east of central London. British police said on Saturday that they had charged one man, 25-year-old Maurice Robinson of Craigavon in Northern Ireland, with 39 counts of manslaughter and other offences including conspiracy to traffic people. Police initially believed the dead were Chinese, but Beijing said the nationalities had not been confirmed and on Saturday a senior British police officer in charge of identification asked for help from Britain's Vietnamese community. Chinese and Vietnamese officials are now both working closely with British police, the two countries' embassies have said. Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc ordered government officials to help establish the identities of the victims and look into cases of Vietnamese citizens sent abroad illegally. Father Anthony Dang Huu Nam, a Catholic priest in the remote town of Yen Thanh in northern-central Vietnam's Nghe An province, 300 km (180 miles) south of Hanoi, said he believed most of the dead were likely from Vietnam. He told Reuters he was liaising with family members. ""The whole district is covered in sorrow,"" Nam said, as prayers for the dead rang out over loudspeakers throughout the misty, rain-soaked town on Saturday. ""This is a catastrophe for our community."" On Saturday evening, Nam led around 500 worshippers in prayers for the dead as they held lit candles in the modest, white-walled church in Yen Thanh. ""We are here to pray for justice and peace, and for the victims of society. We pray for the 39 people who lost their lives on the way to the UK. They are people coming from central Vietnam, our land,"" Nam said. Nam said families had told him they knew relatives were traveling to Britain at the time the container truck was traveling, and had been unable to contact their loved ones. The British police officer in charge of identifying the victims, Detective Chief Inspector Martin Pasmore, said very few were carrying official identification and that he hoped to identify the dead through fingerprints, dental records and DNA, as well as photos from friends and relatives. Police have found more than 500 items within the truck including bags, clothing and mobile phones that need to be assessed. Once a preliminary identification has been made, liaison officers will be deployed to support families. Apart from the man charged, who will appear in court on Monday for an initial hearing, three other people are under arrest in Britain on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking. A fourth person is under arrest in Dublin.  'BEAUTIFUL DAY' In Yen Thanh, Nghe An province, dozens of worried relatives of 19-year-old Bui Thi Nhung gathered in the family's small courtyard home where her distraught mother has been unable to rise from her bed. ""She said she was in France and on the way to the UK, where she has friends and relatives,"" said Nhung's cousin, Hoang Thi Linh. ""We are waiting and hoping it's not her among the victims, but it's very likely. We pray for her every day. There were two people from my village traveling in that group"". In comments under a photo uploaded to Nhung's Facebook account on Monday, two days before the doomed truck was discovered, one friend asked how her journey was going. ""Not good,"" Nhung replied. ""Almost spring,"" she said, using a term in Vietnamese meaning she had almost reached her destination. Other photos on her account show her sightseeing in Brussels on Oct. 18. ""Such a beautiful day,"" Nhung posted. Another person who may have died is Nguyen Dinh Tu, who had been working illegally in Romania, and Germany, where he lost his job.  A few months ago, he asked his wife Hoang Thi Thuong to help him raise 11,000 pounds ($14,000) to cover the cost of an illicit trip from Germany to the United Kingdom. ""I lost contact with him on October 21,"" Thuong told Reuters. ""I have a big debt to pay, no hope, and no energy to do anything"". Tu's father said relatives in the United Kingdom had told him that Tu was inside the truck, and had been planning to pick him up. ""They were supposed to pick him up at the drop-off point but  they called and said Tu was in that truck,"" Tu's father, Nguyen Dinh Sat, told Reuters. ""I haven't heard anything from my son"".  PARENTS 'CAN'T BREATHE' How the victims came to be in the truck is not yet known. Some 70% of Vietnamese trafficking cases in the United Kingdom between 2009-2016 were for labor exploitation, including cannabis production and work in nail bars, according to a British government report last year. ""Women and girls from rural areas are also considered more susceptible to trafficking,"" the report said. British police sought to reassure anyone living in Britain illegally that they would not be investigated if they came forward to help with the identification.  ""If you come to us, we will do all we can to put our arm around you and take you through this process, and establish as quickly as possible whether or not we have your loved involved in this tragic incident, and try and reunite you,"" Pasmore said.  Nghe An is one of Vietnam's poorest provinces, and home to many victims of human trafficking who end up in Europe, according to a March report by the Pacific Links Foundation, a U.S.-based anti-trafficking organization.  Other victims are believed to come from the neighboring province of Ha Tinh, Father Nam said. In the first eight months of this year, 41,790 people left Ha Tinh looking for work elsewhere, including overseas, according to state media. The province was ravaged by one of Vietnam's worst environmental disasters in 2016 when a steel mill owned by Taiwan's Formosa Plastics contaminated coastal waters, devastating local fishing and tourism industries. Another suspected victim from Ha Tinh, 26-year-old Pham Thi Tra My, had sent a text message to her mother saying she could not breathe at about the time the truck container was en route from Belgium to Britain. ""That girl who said in her message that she couldn't breathe in the truck? Her parents can't breathe here at home,"" Nam said.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_KBN1X50C2	"GRAYS, England (Reuters) - British police want help from the Vietnamese community in Britain and abroad to identify the 39 people found dead in the back of a refrigerated truck on Wednesday, a senior officer said on Saturday. Detective Chief Inspector Martin Pasmore said his officers had found ""very, very few ID papers"" among the bodies and hoped to identify the dead through fingerprints, dental records and DNA, as well as photos from friends and relatives. Police initially said they thought the victims might be Chinese, but have since said they do not want to speculate on the victims' nationality before they have been formally identified.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L4N27B012	"YEN THANH, Vietnam, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The majority of the 39 people found dead in the back of a truck near London were likely from Vietnam, a community leader from the rural, rice-growing community where many of the victims are believed to have come from told Reuters on Saturday. The discovery of the bodies - 38 adults and one teenager - was made on Wednesday after emergency services were alerted to people in a truck container on an industrial site in Grays, about 32km (20 miles) east of central London. Police have said they believe the dead were Chinese but Beijing said the nationalities had not yet been confirmed. Chinese and Vietnamese officials are now both working closely with British police, their respective embassies have said. Father Anthony Dang Huu Nam, a catholic priest in the remote town of Yen Thanh in northern-central Vietnam's Nghe An province, 300km (180 miles) south of Hanoi, said he was liaising with family members of the victims. ""The whole district is covered in sorrow,"" Nam said, as prayers for the dead rang out over loudspeakers throughout the misty, rain-soaked town on Saturday. ""I'm still collecting contact details for all the victim's families, and will hold a ceremony to pray for them tonight."" ""This is a catastrophe for our community."" Nam said families told him they knew relatives were travelling to the UK at the time and had been unable to contact their loved ones. Vietnam's foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday that it had instructed its London embassy to assist British police with the identification of victims. The ministry did not respond to a request for further comment regarding the nationalities of the dead. Nghe An is one of Vietnam's poorest provinces, and home to many victims of human trafficking who end up in Europe, according to a March report by the Pacific Links Foundation, a U.S.-based anti-trafficking organisation. Other victims are believed to come from the neighbouring province of Ha Tinh, Nam said, where in the first eight months of this year, 41,790 people left looking for work elsewhere, including overseas, according to state media. The province was ravaged by one of Vietnam's worst environmental disasters in 2016 when a steel mill owned by Taiwan's Formosa Plastics contaminated coastal waters, devastating local fishing and tourism industries and sparking widespread protests. One suspected victim from Ha Tinh, 26-year-old Pham Thi Tra My, had sent a text message to her mother saying she could not breathe at about the time the truck container was en route from Belgium to Britain. ""That girl who said in her message that she couldn't breathe in the truck? Her parents can't breathe here at home,"" Nam said.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_KBN1X41N1	"By Idrees Ali and Robin Emmott BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The United States will strengthen its military presence in Syria with ""mechanized forces"" to prevent Islamic State fighters seizing oil fields and revenue, the U.S. Defense Secretary said on Friday, the latest twist in President Donald Trump's confusing policy on Syria.  Trump has been softening his pullout plans for Syria after a backlash from Congress, including among key Republicans, who say he enabled a long-threatened Turkish incursion against Kurdish forces in Syria who had been America's top allies in the battle against Islamic State. ""We are now taking some actions... to strengthen our position at Deir al zor, to ensure that we can deny ISIS access to the oil fields,"" Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters during a press conference, using an acronym for Islamic State.  ""We are reinforcing that position, it will include some mechanized forces,"" Esper said. Mechanized forces usually include tanks and other military assets.  He did not say how many forces were currently in the region or how many additional forces would be sent.  Any significant U.S. military presence on the ground would need to be properly defended from potential attack, particularly in oil-rich areas of Syria that could become targets of not just Islamic State militants but potentially Russian-backed or Iran-backed forces operating in the country. The vacuum left by Trump's partial withdrawal has created an opening that Russia exploited by moving forces into the area. U.S. officials worry that Iran-backed forces in Syria could also capitalize on the chaos. Around 300 more Russian military police have arrived in Syria, the Russian defense ministry said on Friday, under an accord between Ankara and Moscow which halted Turkey's military incursion into northeast Syria. Amid fears that Islamic State could stage a comeback, Trump said on Wednesday a small number of U.S. troops would remain in the area of Syria ""where they have the oil,"" a reference to oilfields in the Kurdish-controlled region. On Thursday, Trump said on Twitter that the ""Oil is secured"" and that ""our soldiers have left and are leaving Syria for other places."" Esper said his Turkish counterpart had told him that Ankara had recaptured some of 100 Islamic State militants who are believed to have escaped from prison in Syria as a result of the Turkish incursion. Esper met Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar on Friday in Brussels during a NATO meeting. NATO allies discussed Syria on Thursday, including a German proposal for a multilateral force to patrol a safe zone in northeastern Syria.

As forensic experts began the process of identifying the victims, the Vietnamese embassy in London said families from the southeast Asian country had got in touch about missing relatives. There were growing concerns at least 10 of the victims could have been from Vietnam. Hoa Nghiem from Human Rights Space, a civic network based in Vietnam, said that Pham Thi Tra My, 26, had sent a text message to her mother saying she could not breathe at about the time the truck container was en route from Belgium to Britain. ""I’m sorry, mum and dad. My path abroad was not a success. I love you both so much. I can’t breathe. I'm from Nghen Town, Can Loc District, Ha Tinh, Vietnam ...

She said Tra My had gone to China and was planning to reach England via France and that the organisation was getting more alerts about possible Vietnamese victims in the refrigerated trunk, which was found in the early hours of Wednesday. Police have said they believe the dead were Chinese but Beijing said the nationalities had not yet been confirmed. Chinese and Vietnamese officials are now both working closely with British police, their respective embassies said. ""We owe it to those who have died to get this investigation right and speculation is not helpful,"" Essex Police's Deputy Chief Constable Pippa Mills told reporters. ""It may in fact hinder our investigation and its progress."" She said they would not give any more details about the identities or nationalities of the victims until the formal identification process was complete. Her officers were still questioning the 25-year-old truck driver on suspicion of murder following the discovery of the bodies in the back of his truck. He has not been formally identified but a source familiar with the investigation named him as Mo Robinson from the Portadown area of Northern Ireland.  On Friday, police also arrested a man and woman, both aged 38, in Warrington, northwest England, and a 48-year-old man from Northern Ireland at London's Stansted Airport. They are suspected of conspiracy to traffic people and manslaughter. The victims - 31 men and eight women - are being moved to a hospital mortuary from a secure location at docks near the industrial estate in Grays about 20 miles (30 km) east of London where the bodies were found. Post-mortem examinations were beginning to determine how exactly they died while the lengthy process of identifying the deceased was underway. VietHome, an organisation for the Vietnamese community in Britain, said it had received news from 10 families that their relatives were missing. For years, illegal immigrants have attempted to reach Britain stowed away in trucks, often from the European mainland. In 2000, 58 Chinese were found dead in a tomato truck at the port of Dover.  BRITAIN 'HAS NOT FULFILLED RESPONSIBILITY' ""We hope that the British side can as soon as possible confirm and verify the identities of the victims, ascertain what happened and severely punish criminals involved in the case,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily news briefing. China's Global Times, which is published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, said in a Friday editorial that Britain should bear some responsibility for the deaths. ""It is clear that Britain and relevant European countries have not fulfilled their responsibility to protect these people from such a death,"" the widely read tabloid said.  It added that Britain appeared not to have learned its lesson from the Dover incident two decades ago. The police investigation is focussed on the movement of the trailer prior to its arrival at Purfleet docks near Grays little more than an hour before the bodies were found, and on who was behind the suspected human trafficking. Irish company Global Trailer Rentals said it owned the trailer and had rented it out on Oct. 15. The firm said it was unaware of what it was to be used for. The refrigeration unit had travelled to Britain from Zeebrugge in Belgium and the town's chairman, Dirk de Fauw, said he believed the victims died in the trailer before it arrived in the Belgian port. The Times newspaper reported that GPS data showed the container had arrived at the Belgian port at 2.49 p.m. local time on Tuesday before later making the 10-hour sea crossing to Britain. Police said the cab unit of the truck was driven over from Dublin on Sunday, crossing the Irish Sea by ship and entering Britain in North Wales. It picked up the trailer in Purfleet shortly after midnight on Wednesday. Figures last year from the UK's National Crime Agency, which targets serious and organised crime, showed Vietnamese nationals were the third most commonly reported victims of modern slavery or trafficking in Britain, although it did not have statistics about those entering the country illegally.

There were growing concerns at least 10 of the victims could have been from Vietnam. Hoa Nghiem from Human Rights Space, a civic network based in Vietnam, said that Pham Thi Tra My, 26, had sent a text message to her mother saying she could not breathe at about the time the truck container was en route from Belgium to Britain. ""I’m sorry, mum and dad. My path abroad was not a success. I love you both so much. I can’t breathe. I'm from Nghen Town, Can Loc District, Ha Tinh, Vietnam ... I am sorry, Mom,"" the message said, according to Hoa who told Reuters it had come from Tra My's family. She said Tra My had gone to China and was planning to reach England via France and that the organisation was getting more alerts about possible Vietnamese victims in the refrigerated trunk, which was found in the early hours of Wednesday. Police have said they believe the dead were Chinese but Beijing said the nationalities had not yet been confirmed. Chinese and Vietnamese officials are now both working closely with British police, their respective embassies said. ""We owe it to those who have died to get this investigation right and speculation is not helpful,"" Essex Police's Deputy Chief Constable Pippa Mills told reporters. ""It may in fact hinder our investigation and its progress."" She said they would not give any more details about the identities or nationalities of the victims until the formal identification process was complete. Her officers were still questioning the 25-year-old truck driver on suspicion of murder following the discovery of the bodies in the back of his truck. He has not been formally identified but a source familiar with the investigation named him as Mo Robinson from the Portadown area of Northern Ireland. On Friday, police also arrested a man and woman, both aged 38, in Warrington, northwest England, and a 48-year-old man from Northern Ireland at London's Stansted Airport. They are suspected of conspiracy to traffic people and manslaughter. The victims - 31 men and eight women - are being moved to a hospital mortuary from a secure location at docks near the industrial estate in Grays about 20 miles (30 km) east of London where the bodies were found. Post-mortem examinations were beginning to determine how exactly they died while the lengthy process of identifying the deceased was underway. VietHome, an organisation for the Vietnamese community in Britain, said it had received news from 10 families that their relatives were missing. For years, illegal immigrants have attempted to reach Britain stowed away in trucks, often from the European mainland. In 2000, 58 Chinese were found dead in a tomato truck at the port of Dover.  BRITAIN 'HAS NOT FULFILLED RESPONSIBILITY' ""We hope that the British side can as soon as possible confirm and verify the identities of the victims, ascertain what happened and severely punish criminals involved in the case,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily news briefing. China's Global Times, which is published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, said in a Friday editorial that Britain should bear some responsibility for the deaths. ""It is clear that Britain and relevant European countries have not fulfilled their responsibility to protect these people from such a death,"" the widely read tabloid said. It added that Britain appeared not to have learned its lesson from the Dover incident two decades ago. The police investigation is focused on the movement of the trailer prior to its arrival at Purfleet docks near Grays little more than an hour before the bodies were found, and on who was behind the suspected human trafficking. Irish company Global Trailer Rentals said it owned the trailer and had rented it out on Oct. 15. The firm said it was unaware of what it was to be used for. The refrigeration unit had travelled to Britain from Zeebrugge in Belgium and the town's chairman, Dirk de Fauw, said he believed the victims died in the trailer before it arrived in the Belgian port. The Times newspaper reported that GPS data showed the container had arrived at the Belgian port at 2.49 p.m. local time on Tuesday before later making the 10-hour sea crossing to Britain. Police said the cab unit of the truck was driven over from Dublin on Sunday, crossing the Irish Sea by ship and entering Britain in North Wales. It picked up the trailer in Purfleet shortly after midnight on Wednesday. Figures last year from the UK's National Crime Agency, which targets serious and organised crime, showed Vietnamese nationals were the third most commonly reported victims of modern slavery or trafficking in Britain, although it did not have statistics about those entering the country illegally.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N27A407	"By Nita Bhalla NAIROBI, Oct 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda has sought to reassure sexual minorities that they are safe, saying it has no plans to introduce the death penalty for gay sex after reports of rising homophobic attacks. LGBT+ rights campaigners in Uganda have expressed concerns about a spate of attacks after a minister said earlier this month that the government planned to reintroduce a bill colloquially known as ""Kill the Gays"". In a statement on Thursday, President Yoweri Museveni's office denied that and said attacks on LGBT+ people should be reported to police for investigation so that perpetrators could be ""brought to book"". ""(The) government of Uganda does not have any plans of reintroducing the anti-homosexuality bill on the floor of parliament,"" said the statement signed by Esther Mboya, minister in charge of the presidency. ""On allegations that members of minority communities have been murdered, I would like to assert that protection of human life is enshrined in the constitution,"" said the statement, seen by the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Friday. Gay sex carries a possible life sentence in Uganda, one of the most difficult countries in Africa to be a sexual minority where there is increasing confrontation over sexual freedom. Members of the LGBT+ community say they risk physical attacks in their daily life and routinely encounter harassment, as well as facing prejudice over work, housing and health care. Campaigners have reported a spate of attacks this year, including four murders. The latest was on Oct. 4 when a gay rights activist was bludgeoned to death. Earlier this week 16 LGBT+ activists were detained and charged for having gay sex after police raided their charity office and residence, forcing them to undergo anal examinations. Last weekend a gay Rwandan refugee was beaten outside his office in Kampala and a lesbian woman physically assaulted by her doctor, say activists. Police said they had not registered any cases of assaults specifically targeting sexual minorities. Uganda's minister of health said on Friday that she was aware of some of the attacks on the LGBT+ community and appealed to health care providers not to discriminate against them. LGBT+ activists welcomed the statements, but said more action was needed to ensure sexual minorities could live free from fear. ""We would also urge the government to enact legislation against hate crimes and publicly condemn hate speech such as what is being said by some politicians which fuels homophobia,"" said Frank Mugisha, head of Sexual Minorities Uganda. Charges against the 16 activists were a ""sham"" and should be dropped, he added. Uganda's Ethics and Integrity Minister Simon Lokodo said on Oct. 10 that the government planned to re-introduce an anti-homosexuality bill in parliament within weeks to curb the spread of homosexuality. Lokodo's statement was widely reported and international donors to Uganda said they were monitoring the situation closely and stood by the rights of LGBT+ people. A spokesperson for President Museveni later denied the plan, saying Uganda's current penal law - which provides for up to life imprisonment for gay sex - was sufficient.

Lebanon has been swept by more than a week of nationwide protests against a political elite accused of corruption, mismanagement of the state finances and leading the country towards an economic collapse unseen since the 1975-90 civil war. A report from credit rating agency S&P was the latest to sound the alarm over the financial situation. Banks remain closed and have said they will only reopen when life returns to normal. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, whose movement is part of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri's coalition government, urged his followers to stay away from the protests after they clashed with demonstrators in Beirut. The heavily armed Shi'ite group is widely seen as the most powerful player in Lebanon and is part of an Iranian-led regional alliance that is in conflict with U.S.-allied Gulf Arab states that have political allies in the country. Nasrallah praised the protest movement for forcing the government to agree a state budget without new taxes and ""unprecedented"" reforms including draft laws to lift banking secrecy, recover looted wealth and fight corruption. But he also said the demonstrations that began spontaneously had been exploited by regional and international foes. He reiterated Hezbollah's rejection of the resignation of the Hariri government and any move to topple Hezbollah's Christian ally, President Michel Aoun, saying this would leave a void. ""In view of the difficult financial, economic and living situation in the country, in view of security and political tensions that are prevailing in the region ... a vacuum will lead to chaos, to collapse,"" Nasrallah said. He said if Lebanon remained shut down by the protests, people including the army would not get their wages and the country would be plunged into complete chaos. ""I am afraid that there are those who want to take our country and generate social, security and political tensions and to take it to civil war,"" Nasrallah said. ""God willing nothing like this will happen ... but I tell you there is information and doubts about this matter."" The protests took a more violent turn on Friday when groups supporting Hezbollah pushed into a peaceful demonstration in Beirut, scuffling with protesters and forcing riot police to intervene. Dressed in black t-shirts common to Hezbollah supporters, the men shouted ""We heed your call, Nasrallah"". Several protesters were injured in the scuffles, witnesses said. After Nasrallah spoke, Hezbollah supporters waving the group's yellow flag took to the streets of the southern suburbs of Beirut, the group's stronghold. ""They're trying to scare us with war. But they are the generation of war, we are an educated generation and know how to get along with one another,"" said physiotherapist Bilal al Baba, 28, demonstrating in central Beirut. Another protester, Maria, said Nasrallah's speech encouraged her and her friends to come back out to protest. ""The entire country was paralysed waiting for what he had to say,"" she said. Nasrallah urged protesters to accept Aoun's invitation for dialogue. Aoun has suggested a cabinet reshuffle was on the table.  BANKING FEARS Credit rating agency Standard & Poor's said the government's limited ability to address the demonstrators' demands could harm confidence in the banks and adversely effect foreign exchange reserves. Lebanon's banking association has held crisis meetings with the central bank governor and president in recent days in search of a way to reopen banks amid growing fears that a rush on them could deplete dwindling foreign currency deposits. ""Right now we're using the pretext of the demonstrations not to open. We are afraid that when we open people will rush to withdraw their money or transfer it abroad,"" said one senior banker. He said banks were seeking a common policy to meet the needs of customers and the central bank governor has so far avoided capital controls that would likely stop expatriates from sending remittances. As politicians ponder ways out, financial strains are mounting in Lebanon, one of the world's most heavily indebted states. Capital inflows needed to finance the state deficit and pay for imports have been slowing down, generating financial pressures not seen in decades, including the emergence of a black market for dollars. While the central bank's foreign currency reserves were enough to service government debt in the near term, risks to government creditworthiness have risen, S&P said. Lebanon's central bank governor and finance minister could not immediately be reached for comment on the S&P report. There has so far been no financial support from countries which have in the past aided Lebanon, such as Western and Gulf Arab countries. The European Union said it supports Hariri's reforms and is committed to Lebanon and its stability. ""We are confident that the authorities will respond swiftly and wisely to legitimate aspirations of the Lebanese people,"" the EU statement said.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N27A5NC	"By Gopal Sharma KATHMANDU, Oct 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A Nepali woman who was gang raped as a child finally saw her attackers convicted this week after a years-long legal battle that took her to the country's highest court, but said she was still waiting for compensation for her ordeal. Pooja Bohara was dragged into a bathroom and raped in 2012 when she was 14, a case that made headlines and triggered anger across the Himalayan nation. On Thursday, the Supreme Court found two men guilty of gang rape, four years after a lower court acquitted them citing a lack of evidence. The two men now face a jail sentence of up to 19 years, but Bohara, who was stigmatised and was ostracised even by some of her own relatives after she reported the attack, said that did not amount to justice. ""Does just sending two men to jail mean justice to me?"" she said in a brief telephone interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""I should also get compensation."" Bohara left her village in remote western Nepal after the attack and was given shelter by the charity Raksha Nepal, which helps sexually exploited girls and women. Since then she has embarked on a law degree, saying she wanted to become a judge to help other victims get justice, and is now in her final year. Menuka Thapa, who heads Raksha Nepal, said Bohara was granted compensation after her attackers were convicted for the first time, but the payment got held up by their appeal. She welcomed the Supreme Court verdict, saying it showed there was ""rule of law"" in Nepal. ""This has raised hopes that even poor and ordinary victims like Pooja can get justice,"" said Thapa. An average of three rapes is reported in Nepal every day, but the real number is likely much higher, according to Human Rights Watch. In recent years greater media attention, protests by civil society groups and changes in some government policies have helped embolden women and raise awareness about their rights, say campaigners. Earlier this month, Nepal's parliament speaker resigned to allow an investigation into a rape accusation against him. Yet the conviction rate for crimes against women remains low at about 5% as many victims do not testify for fear of the stigma associated with rape, said Thapa of Raksha Nepal.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N27935B	"By Belinda Goldsmith ADDIS ABABA, Oct 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The opening of Ethiopia's once-secretive imperial palace complex has been hailed as symbolising a new era of openness for the east African nation, but it also has another aim - job creation. The Menelik palace and its 40-acre Unity Park compound overlooking Addis Ababa opened to the public this month after being closed for more than a century when it housed emperors but was also used as a torture site under the communist Derg regime. It was established in 1887 by Emperor Menelik II and given back to the city by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who came to power 18 months ago. The move ""symbolises our ability to come together"" while also boosting tourism and jobs, his office said. The palace opening was cited at an annual gathering of social entrepreneurs in Addis Ababa as an example of a rising number of tourism businesses set up with a mission to help local communities - with warnings these projects came with risks. ""(The palace) will add value to our tourism ... it will help Ethiopia,"" said Samrawit Moges, founder of Travel Ethiopia, first company in the country to use female guides. ""But tourism is a very delicate sector that can change the country for better or for worse ... we need to give high importance to the environment."" The growing social enterprise sector is tapping into the global travel and tourism industry, which contributed a record $8.8 trillion and 319 million jobs to the world economy in 2018, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC). The WTTC forecast another 100 million new jobs by 2029.  DANGERS OF GROWTH Matt Pfahlert, co-founder of the Australian Centre for Rural Entrepreneurship, said growing numbers of tourism projects from Australia to Africa were being led by social enterprises - businesses set up with a mission to help society. There was no official record on the number of such ventures. Pfahlert led a A$2.5 million ($1.7 million) community buy-back of an old jail in his home town of Beechworth in the Australian state of Victoria, that was famed for its connection to the nation's legendary outlaw Ned Kelly. It opened in 2017, creating 22 jobs in a rural area with few opportunities and was helping to raise funds to train young people on business development to stem a decline in rural areas. ""For us the jail is the engine for a national project,"" Pfahlert told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at the 12th annual Social Enterprise World Forum (SEWF). ""If we get it right we can make a huge difference,"" said Pfahlert, adding that cycling tours were another draw. He said tourism social enterprises focused on helping communities, while traditional tourism businesses tended to be profit-oriented with a focus on volume growth. In Ireland, for example, the social enterprise My Streets trains homeless people to run tours of Dublin and Drogheda. While in India, Grassroutes aims to create ""one million livelihood opportunities"" and reduce rural migration by running various tourist activities in villages outside Mumbai. But tourism social entrepreneurs said in the rush to do good, it was important to be wary of not growing too fast as this could negatively impact communities and the environment. Theodore Nzabonimpa, founder of Beyond The Gorilla Experiences in Rwanda, said it had been important to stem the number of tourists visiting the mountain gorillas in his country by doubling national park prices in 2017 before damage occurred. ""The risks can be huge even if the intention is good ... you have to take quick action to address any risks,"" said Nzabonimpa, whose tour company promotes community ecotourism.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N27A57C	"(Adds background, comments from Trump on Syria) By Idrees Ali and Robin Emmott BRUSSELS, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The United States will strengthen its military presence in Syria with ""mechanized forces"" to prevent Islamic State fighters seizing oil fields and revenue, the U.S. Defense Secretary said on Friday, the latest twist in President Donald Trump's confusing policy on Syria. Trump has been softening his pullout plans for Syria after a backlash from Congress, including among key Republicans, who say he enabled a long-threatened Turkish incursion against Kurdish forces in Syria who had been America's top allies in the battle against Islamic State. ""We are now taking some actions... to strengthen our position at Deir al zor, to ensure that we can deny ISIS access to the oil fields,"" Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters during a press conference, using an acronym for Islamic State. ""We are reinforcing that position, it will include some mechanized forces,"" Esper said. Mechanized forces usually include tanks and other military assets. He did not say how many forces were currently in the region or how many additional forces would be sent. Any significant U.S. military presence on the ground would need to be properly defended from potential attack, particularly in oil-rich areas of Syria that could become targets of not just Islamic State militants but potentially Russian-backed or Iran-backed forces operating in the country. The vacuum left by Trump's partial withdrawal has created an opening that Russia exploited by moving forces into the area. U.S. officials worry that Iran-backed forces in Syria could also capitalize on the chaos. Around 300 more Russian military police have arrived in Syria, the Russian defence ministry said on Friday, under an accord between Ankara and Moscow which halted Turkey's military incursion into northeast Syria. Amid fears that Islamic State could stage a comeback, Trump said on Wednesday a small number of U.S. troops would remain in the area of Syria ""where they have the oil,"" a reference to oilfields in the Kurdish-controlled region. On Thursday, Trump said on Twitter that the ""Oil is secured"" and that ""our soldiers have left and are leaving Syria for other places."" Esper said his Turkish counterpart had told him that Ankara had recaptured some of 100 Islamic State militants who are believed to have escaped from prison in Syria as a result of the Turkish incursion. Esper met Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar on Friday in Brussels during a NATO meeting. NATO allies discussed Syria on Thursday, including a German proposal for a multilateral force to patrol a safe zone in northeastern Syria.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N27A0I2	"KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A ustralia has banned climbers on Uluru, one of the country's landmarks that is sacred to its indigenous custodians, becoming the latest cultural site around the world to close in order to protect its heritage and the environment. The giant monolith, a UNESCO World Heritage Site formerly known as Ayers Rock, will become permanently off limits to climbers from Saturday after a decades-long fight by the Anangu people, the traditional owners of Uluru. The Anangu people have called for a ban since 1985, when the park was returned to indigenous control. Below is a list of cultural and other important sites that have closed or imposed new restrictions on tourists as authorities grapple with the challenge of how best to protect people, heritage, the environment and wildlife.  1. MAYA BAY, THAILAND: The island cove was made famous by the 2000 film ""The Beach"" starring Leonardo DiCaprio. It was closed to tourists last year until 2021 in a bid to salvage the area's coral reefs, which have been damaged by warmer temperatures and a flood of tourists.  2. BORACAY ISLAND, THE PHILIPPINES: The resort was closed for a six-month cleanup from April to October 2018 after being described as a ""cesspool"" by President Rodrigo Duterte. The island attracted 2 million visitors the previous year but has now limited numbers to 19,000 per day and banned beach parties, smoking and drinking.  3. MOUNT EVEREST BASE CAMP, CHINA: The Chinese government closed its side of the Everest base camp this year to anyone without a climbing permit due to the huge amounts of rubbish piling up at the site, according to the Lonely Planet travel website. The Chinese base camp, located in Tibet, was accessible by car.  4. FJADRARGLJUFUR CANYON, ICELAND: The popular site, which featured in one of Justin Bieber's music videos, was closed to tourists for about three months this year due to damage from wet weather and foot traffic. The number of visitors had nearly doubled after being featured in the pop singer's ""I'll Show You"" video.  5. THE FAROE ISLANDS, DENAMRK: Ten popular tourists sites were closed temporarily this year for maintenance by an international team of volunteers after a 10% growth in visitor numbers in recent years.  6. SIPADAN ISLAND, MALAYSIA: One of the world's most renowned scuba diving spots on Malaysia's part of Borneo island will be shut for a month every December from 2020 to allow the coral and marine ecosystem to recuperate.  7. KOMODO ISLAND, INDONESIA: Authorities are due to limit visitor numbers and raise entry prices to the island in order to conserve the population of the Komodo dragons, the world's largest living species of lizard. Officials initially planned to close the island for one year from 2020 but later scrapped the idea.  8. SPANISH STEPS, ITALY: Rome banned tourists from sitting on the famous monument in August, in a crackdown on overcrowding by tourists. Visitors can still walk up and down, but offenders of the sitting ban can be fined up to 400 euros ($444). The site was largely shut between October 2015 and September 2016 for a private restoration after the 135 steps had become loose, stained and cracked under the strain of daily use by both residents and visitors.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N27A2IU	"By Peter Nicholls GRAYS, England, Oct 25 (Reuters) - British police were questioning the driver of a truck in which 39 people, believed to be Chinese nationals, were found dead this week as post-mortem examinations of some of the victims began on Friday. The 25-year-old driver from Northern Ireland was arrested on suspicion of murder after the grim discovery of the bodies in the back of his refrigerated truck on an industrial estate near London in the early hours of Wednesday morning. He has not been formally identified but a source familiar with the investigation said he was Mo Robinson from the Portadown area of the British province. Detectives will decide later whether to charge him with an offence, release him or ask a court for more time to quiz him. Late on Thursday, British authorities moved 11 of the victims - 31 men and eight women - to a hospital mortuary from a secure location at docks near to the industrial estate in Grays about 20 miles (30 km) east of London where the bodies were found. Police have said the process of identifying those who died would take some time while autopsies were carried out to determine how exactly they died. ""This is the largest investigation of its kind Essex Police has ever had to conduct and it is likely to take some considerable time to come to a conclusion,"" Essex Chief Constable Ben-Julian Harrington said. His force has said their priority was ensuring respect and compassion for the victims. The Chinese Embassy in London said it had sent a team to Essex to meet with local police. The focus of the police investigation is on the movement of the trailer prior to its arrival at Purfleet docks near Grays little more than an hour before the bodies were found and who was behind the suspected human trafficking. Irish company Global Trailer Rentals said it owned the trailer and had rented it out on Oct. 15. The firm said it was unaware of what it was to be used for. The refrigeration unit had travelled to Britain from Zeebrugge in Belgium and the town's chairman, Dirk de Fauw, said he believed the victims died in the trailer before it arrived there. ""We have a safe system with safety guards, we have cameras everywhere, we have policemen in the streets of Zeebrugge, in the dunes with horses,"" de Fauw, who is also mayor of the nearby city of Bruges, told Reuters Television. The Times newspaper reported that GPS data showed the container had arrived at the Belgian port at 2.49 p.m. local time on Tuesday before later making the 10-hour trip to Britain. Police said the cab unit of the truck was driven over from Dublin on Sunday, entering Britain in North Wales. It picked up the trailer in Purfleet shortly after midnight on Wednesday. For years, illegal immigrants have attempted to reach Britain stowed away in trucks, often from the European mainland. In 2000, 58 Chinese were found dead in a tomato truck at the port of Dover. They had travelled to Britain from Zeebrugge. The National Crime Agency, which targets serious and organised crime, said it was helping the investigation and working urgently to identify any gangs involved. The head of the Road Haulage Association said traffickers were ""upping their game"" and closer cooperation with European nations was needed, although that may be complicated by Britain's potential exit from the European Union.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N27A1RL	"MANILA, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The Philippines will lift a 2018 moratorium on foreign scientific research in its exclusive economic zone so it can  exploit marine resources, the national security adviser said on Friday. President Rodrigo Duterte banned all scientific research by foreigners off the Philippines' Pacific coast in February last year and told the navy to chase away unauthorized vessels. National security adviser Hermogenes Esperon said that allowing foreign governments and entities to conduct maritime research again is ""good for us... because we get to know more of the maritime domain"". The Philippines is also beefing up its capabilities to enforce fisheries laws, Esperon said, with plans to acquire more coast guard assets and develop multi-purpose fishing vessels. ""Whatever we spend on defence should strengthen our position on developing our maritime domain especially the West Philippine Sea into what we call the blue economy"", Esperon told a media briefing. Manila calls the South China Sea the West Philippine Sea. Capitalizing on the so-called blue economy, such as using the oceans to generate energy, or tapping its oil and mineral resources, could help boost economic growth in the Philippines, where one-fifth of its 107 million people still live below the national poverty line. The ban on foreign scientific research last year focused on an area called the Benham Rise, which the United Nations in 2012 declared part of the Philippines' continental shelf. It is believed to be rich in biodiversity and tuna, and scientists from the United States and Japan have surveyed it numerous times. However, Chinese interest has caused concern among Philippine nationalists mistrustful of its intentions after decades of disputes and perceived encroachments by Beijing in the South China Sea. Before the moratorium, Esperon said ""some institutions and entities"", came in without permission, while others did not allow Filipino scientists to board their vessels. He did not identify them. This year, two Chinese research vessels were spotted lingering in Philippine-controlled waters, which became the subject of a diplomatic protest in August. The Philippines has also protested the presence of more than 100 Chinese fishing vessels off Thitu a tiny island it holds near China's militarized artificial island at Subi Reef. China claims it has historic right of ownership to almost the entire South China Sea, despite a 2016 international arbitration ruling that said that claim had no legal basis under international law. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei also have overlapping claims to parts of it. Thitu island, the Philipines most strategic outpost in the South China Sea, is in the midst of major upgrades to its dilapidated facilities, Esperon said.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N27A1RV	"By Greg Stutchbury TOKYO, Oct 25 (Reuters) - All Blacks prop Joe Moody was not buying into the advice of famed Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu that ""if your opponent is of choleric temperament, seek to irritate him"" ahead of his World Cup semi-final showdown with Kyle Sinckler. The England tighthead prop, who has acknowledged he had problems controlling himself on the field, has been targeted by opponents before as they sought to exploit his explosive temper. Sinckler was involved in two on field incidents in this year's Six Nations tournament while Wales coach Warren Gatland labelled him an ""emotional time bomb"". During the British and Irish Lions tour of New Zealand in 2017, he had to be restrained by team mates when he was tackled in the air by Charlie Faumuina and got involved in a pushing match with several All Blacks. Not surprisingly, Moody was asked a number of times on Friday whether the All Blacks would look to target Sinckler at Yokohama Stadium on Saturday. The 31-year-old, however, was not prepared to mimic coaches Steve Hansen and Eddie Jones, who have followed the Chinese military philosopher's 'Art of War' teaching and embarked in a running psychological battle all week through the media. ""I haven't looked at anyone in particular,"" was the extent of Moody's responses when asked if he had concentrated on Sinckler, and whether he had looked at ways to combat him. ""As far as that whole front row goes, just looking forward to that battle and hopefully get one up I guess."" It is clear Sinckler has been working on curbing his temper, a fact probably not lost on the All Blacks prop. He walked away when goaded by the Wallabies front row in the quarter-final last week and then later scored his first test try in England's 40-16 victory that propelled them to the showdown with the All Blacks. Sinckler said earlier this year that a seven-week ban for eye gouging in late 2017 had given him an opportunity to think about his temper and after last week's quarter-final said he was still working on it. ""It's something I have really tried to own - my discipline - just being cool in the moment,"" he told reporters at Oita Stadium. ""Being a man isn't losing your rag and your emotions, and showing the opposition how you really feel. ""It's about being calm, being disciplined, putting the team first and doing your job. ""And not allowing your ego to take control."" Or as Sun Tzu said: ""what is essential in war is victory"".

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26S3MZ	"By Menna A. Farouk SAHEL SELIM, Egypt, Oct 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In a small village 45 minutes from the city of Assiut, in southern Egypt, a group of farmers and their families gathered to watch a theatre performance that aimed to find the funny side of climate change. The hour-long comedy, which has so far been performed in 50 villages in the Upper Egypt region, in the country's south, tells the story of a farmer who refuses to pay for a new, more water-efficient agricultural canal. When a snake bites him and he is thought to be dead, the farmer hears how much his family and neighbours hated him because he rejected modern farming methods. At the end of the show, he changes his perspective. The play is part of a $7-million project funded by the World Food Programme (WFP) and managed by the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture that aims to help farmers in the region cope better with climate change threats through modern technology, sustainable growing techniques and better understanding of climate issues. Organisers say the project, which started in 2013 and is scheduled to end early next year, has boosted the production of some major crops by at least a third and drastically cut water consumption on the farms involved. It is one in a series of efforts the Egyptian government has made over the past decade to limit the negative impact of climate change on farmers across the country. ""Community mobilisation on the issue of climate change can encourage many people to embrace the ideas of the project. And theatre is one of the methods to mobilise the community,"" said Ayam Abu el-Hagag, an actor in the traveling troupe and also an agricultural advisor. He noted that each time the troupe delivers a joke on stage, the characters explain the information to make it accessible to all farmers, even those with little or no formal education. ""Comedy helps people understand things easier,"" he added.  HIGHLY VULNERABLE Climate change has been a major challenge for Egypt and according to the WFP, ""southern Egypt is one of the areas most vulnerable to climate change within the region"". Environmental groups regard Egypt as one of the countries most threatened by the negative effects of climate change, which include sea-level rise, water poverty, and deteriorating public health and ecosystems. The WFP forecasts that Upper Egypt could lose up to 30% of its food production by 2050 as climate change brings more extreme weather and other threats. Saber Osman, director of the climate change adaptation department at Egypt's Ministry of Environment, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that losses could lead to a major crisis for Egypt's farming sector. Agriculture represents almost 15% of the country's gross domestic product and employs about a third of the workforce, he said. The idea behind the WFP project is to get farmers involved in the frontline fight against climate change and stamp out bad farming habits, said the project's director, Othman el-Sheikh. That includes encouraging farmers to plant crop varieties that require less water and to follow new irrigation methods to reduce water consumption. Farmers also learn how to combine traditional farming techniques with more modern technology, such as solar-powered irrigation pumps and an app that alerts farmers to incoming weather events. One main focus for the project is to help farmers work together, to cut the cost of seeds by buying them in bulk and planting them across several neighbouring farms, el-Sheikh explained. ""Fragmented agricultural holdings are common throughout Egypt in general and in Upper Egypt in particular,"" he said. When they work independently, many farmers cannot afford to access high-quality resources, which lowers their productivity and leads to about 10% of land lying fallow, he added. The initiative helps farmers organise into groups of at least 70, who agree to pool their resources. Every planting season, the Society Development Association in Sahel Selim, which is working with the WFP on the project, buys enough seed for all 70 farmers and divides the seeds equally among them. The farmers carry out the sowing and eventual harvesting together, cutting costs by sharing equipment and manpower, el-Sheikh explained. The hope is that once the project ends, the farmer groups will be making enough revenue to allow them to buy high-quality seeds for themselves, he said. El-Sheikh added that almost 2,000 farms have been consolidated into larger farming groups through the project in the past three years.  FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE The WFP project also runs a loan program that provides villagers with goats and ducks to give them an alternative source of income in case their crops fail. Sabrine Haridi, a 33-year-old mother of four children in Sahel Selim, said she got a loan to acquire 38 ducks, which allow her to cover the family's expenses, even in seasons when her husband's wheat harvest falls short. She sells some of the ducks for their meat and rears more from eggs, selling them when they mature. Any profit she makes goes toward paying off the loan. ""Two years ago, I was desperate because my husband could not afford our daily needs. I am now financially independent,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""When my husband fails to get the expected money from his crop due to climate change, I pay for whatever we need, including food, clothes and school expenses,"" she added.  'IN GOD'S HANDS' Since the project was launched in Egypt in 2013, half a million farmers have become involved, said el-Sheikh He told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that applying the new methods has increased wheat production by 30% to 40%, boosted sugarcane output by about 30% and reduced water consumption by a third. But getting to that point was not easy, said Osman at the environment ministry. ""Community resistance to adopting methods for coping with climate change is common in Egyptian villages,"" he said, adding that some farmers do not see climate change as an issue that can be addressed because it is ""in God's hands"". El-Sheikh said that some farmers used to ask him, ""What would you do to combat climate change? Would you change God's weather?"" He told them the efforts only aimed to help farmers cope with changing weather, not shift the weather itself. ""Convincing farmers to use modern technology and advanced agricultural means, as well as encouraging women to take part in the project, are some of the biggest challenges we face,"" El Sheikh added. Hassan Bekheet, 53, said he didn't need much convincing to swap his maize crops for drought-tolerant sorghum when he joined the project in Sahel Selim. Once he made the switch, his crop yield increased by about 25%, as did his revenues, he said, while his costs went down by 15%. He was so happy with what he learned from the project that he got together with other participants to pass those lessons on to neighbours. ""We are all in the same boat and we should fight these changes together,"" Bekheet said. (Reporting by Menna A. Farouky; Editing by Jumana Farouky and Laurie Goering.

India's cabinet this week passed a bill to regularise 1,797 unauthorised slums in the country's most populous city, giving residents ownership rights at ""minimal rates"" that would enable them to build and sell properties and take loans. Mapping is to begin shortly, according to a statement from the ministry of housing and urban affairs, with the bill due to be presented for passage during the next session of parliament from mid-November. ""It will transform the lives of more than 40 lakh (4 million) residents who came to Delhi in search of a better life and livelihood but were forced to live in squalor,"" said Housing Minister Hardeep Singh Puri. ""Besides providing a legitimate claim to the property, the decision will encourage property holders to invest in safe structures, thereby improving living conditions in these colonies substantially,"" he said at a press briefing this week. The plan to regularise Delhi's unauthorised settlements had been floated for more than a decade. Earlier this year, the Delhi government said it would study about 1,700 such settlements and consider a plan to legalise them. Most inhabitants are migrant workers from other parts of India who cannot afford regular housing in the city of more than 18 million people. Authorities have built roads and drains in some settlements, but many lack basic facilities and residents face the constant threat of eviction, according to housing rights activists. Under the proposed law, authorities will map the boundaries of the slum areas, and prepare a plan. Residents will have to provide basic documentation and pay a nominal charge to register their property and receive the title, Puri said. ""It will pave the way for incentivised planned urbanisation, and transform urban squalor into modern urban spaces with modern amenities. Work will start immediately,"" he said. Worldwide, about 1 billion people live in slums and informal settlements. By 2030, 3 billion people will lack access to adequate and affordable housing, according to UN-Habitat, the United Nations' settlements agency. Regularising Delhi's unauthorised colonies has been a campaign promise of many political parties, and this week's announcement comes months ahead of a local election that must be held by February next year. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the federal government had declined to act on the city's earlier proposal for legalising informal settlements. ""While welcome and urgently required, the announcement to regularise 'unauthorised' colonies has been made so many times without being implemented, that it is unclear what it means,"" said Shivani Chaudhry, executive director, Housing and Land Rights Network, a non-profit in Delhi. The regularisation process must be an inclusive one that does not exclude people on account of faulty surveys, minor technicalities, or their inability to pay, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Friday. ""It must ensure equal access to basic services, adequate housing, and protection from demolition and eviction."" (Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Michael Taylor.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N2710FF	"By Nanchanok Wongsamuth BANGKOK, Oct 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When Nanticha ""Lynn"" Ocharoenchai organised Thailand's first climate strike in March, more than half of the 50 people who showed up at the rally in Bangkok were students at international schools and expatriates. The same day, Ralyn ""Lilly"" Satidtanasarn, then aged 11, and a group of fellow pupils submitted an open letter to the prime minister, calling for urgent action on climate change. ""The fact that Lilly and I can do this draws a lot from being in international schools,"" said 21-year-old Lynn. There they received classes on the environment, whereas most Thai state schools do not teach the subject, Lynn noted in an interview a week after graduating from Chulalongkorn University. The young pair are often said to be Thailand's version of Greta Thunberg, the teenage Swedish activist who has inspired other children worldwide to skip school and demonstrate in the streets about the need to halt global warming and its impacts. Lynn's mission is to boost awareness among the Thai public about climate change in a country that is witnessing warmer temperatures, sea-level rise, floods and droughts. Its capital Bangkok, built on the flood-plains of the Chao Phraya River, is expected to be among the urban areas hit hardest as the climate heats up. Nearly 40% of Bangkok may be inundated each year as soon as 2030 due to more extreme rainfall, according to the World Bank. But while many Thais are directly experiencing the growing effects of climate change, Lynn said some Asian social norms made it hard for her to achieve her aims. ""In Asia, we have a culture of seniority, and young people aren't supposed to speak up for themselves and are not supposed to speak against adults,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a Bangkok coffee shop.  LOCAL LINK LACKING Lynn's interest in climate change was sparked through writing articles on the environment as a journalism intern. In March, she read about Thunberg, which prompted her to create a Facebook event for a climate strike in Bangkok. ""I could truly relate to her frustration and depression, and just feelings of hopelessness,"" said Lynn. ""For years I cried in my bedroom, and I'm sad and I'm just like, no one's going to do anything about it. But I figured if Greta can do it... I can probably do something too,"" she said. Since she set up the Facebook page ""Climate Strike Thailand"", it has attracted almost 5,000 followers. ""Initially I had no idea about Thai social media and how to deal with Thai culture and Thai people and changing their mindset, but since March I've learned so much,"" she said. Tara Buakamsri, Thailand director for Greenpeace Southeast Asia, said young people in provinces outside Bangkok have long campaigned on environmental issues affecting their home towns, such as opposing gold mines or coal-power plants. But there has been no networking platform to link them with groups in the capital, and Climate Strike Thailand has yet to spread beyond middle-class and international school students, he added. ""While the recent climate strikes are connected to climate change issues (at) the international level, they have yet to connect on the local level,"" said Buakamsri.  'JUST THE BEGINNING' Since the first March strike, Lynn has led two more in May and September. For the third, about 200 young people marched to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, demanding that the government declare a climate emergency and shift to 100% renewable energy by 2040. In 2015, Thailand signed the Paris climate agreement and pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20-25% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. But new coal-fired power plants have since been promoted both in Thailand and neighbouring countries, which activists say contradicts climate change goals. ""These climate strikes are by no means methods to solve the problem,"" Lynn said. ""It's just the beginning where you acknowledge the problem."" Lilly, meanwhile, now 12, has been meeting with business and the government, urging them to care more about the environment. Her persistence over the last two years has paid off, and she is widely credited for a pledge by more than 40 national retailers to ban plastic bags by next year. ""I see no progress made by the government,"" she told journalists recently. ""I only see progress made by Lynn and me."" (Reporting by Nanchanok Wongsamuth @nanchanokw; editing by Megan Rowling.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_KBN1X30O6	"By Simon Dawson GRAYS, England (Reuters) - Police were given more time on Thursday to question a driver arrested on suspicion of murder after 39 people, believed to be Chinese nationals, were found dead in a refrigerated truck near London, with the investigation focusing on human trafficking. Officers searched three properties in the County Armagh area of Northern Ireland. The driver has not been formally identified but a source familiar with the investigation said he was Mo Robinson from the Portadown area of the British province. Paramedics and police found the bodies of 31 men and eight women on Wednesday in a truck container on an industrial estate at Grays in Essex, about 20 miles (30 km) east of London.  For years, illegal immigrants have attempted to reach Britain stowed away in trucks, often from the European mainland. In 2000, 58 Chinese were found dead in a tomato truck at the port of Dover. ""We read with heavy heart the reports about the death of 39 people in Essex,"" the Chinese Embassy said in a statement. Police were given permission by magistrates to detain the 25-year-old driver for an additional 24 hours on Thursday.     The National Crime Agency, which targets serious and organised crime, said it was helping the investigation and working urgently to identify any gangs involved. Shaun Sawyer, national spokesman for British police on human trafficking, said thousands of people were seeking to come to the United Kingdom illegally. While they were able to rescue many of those smuggled in, Britain was perceived by organised crime as a potentially easy target for traffickers. ""You can't turn the United Kingdom into a fortress. We have to accept that we have permeable borders,"" he told BBC radio.  DIGNITY The trailer part of the truck arrived at Purfleet docks in Essex from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge - as did the vehicle involved in 2000. The chairman of Zeebrugge, Dirk de Fauw, said he believed the victims died in the trailer before it arrived there. ""We have a safe system with safety guards, we have cameras everywhere, we have policemen in the streets of Zeebrugge, in the dunes with horses,"" de Fauw, who is also mayor of the nearby city of Bruges, told Reuters Television. ""I think they were dead before they are coming here to Zeebrugge. I think so."" The truck's red cab unit, which had ""Ireland"" emblazoned on the windscreen along with the message ""The Ultimate Dream"", entered Britain via Holyhead in north Wales, having started its journey in Dublin, police said. Irish company Global Trailer Rentals said it owned the trailer and had rented it out on Oct. 15 from its depot in County Monaghan at a rate of 275 euros ($305) a week, Irish broadcaster RTE said. The firm said it was unaware of what it was to be used for, RTE added.  The discovery of the bodies was made at 1.40 a.m. just over an hour after the container arrived in Purfleet, not far from the industrial estate in Grays.  The vehicle has been moved to a secure site at nearby Tilbury Docks where forensic work can take place. Officials have set up a book of condolence at civic offices in Grays. Eleven bodies were transported on Thursday from the Port of Tilbury to a hospital in the town of Chelmsford for the first post-mortem examinations and identification.         Essex police said their priority was to ensure dignity for the victims in the largest investigation of its kind undertaken by the force, which was likely to be time-consuming. ""I want to express my sincere condolences to the families of the 39 people who have sadly lost their lives,"" Essex Chief Constable Ben-Julian Harrington said. ""We will conduct this investigation with respect for every single one of those people.""     The head of the Road Haulage Association said traffickers were ""upping their game"" and closer cooperation with European nations was needed, although that may be complicated by Britain's potential exit from the European Union.  ""There is simply not enough being done in terms of security, in terms of the protection of vehicles across Europe,"" Richard Burnett told BBC TV.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_KBN1X325G	"By Marine  Strauss and Philip Blenkinsop BRUSSELS (Reuters) - When France shut the Calais shanty town known as the Jungle in 2016, migrants seeking entry to Britain were forced to look for less safe passage up the coast in Belgium - the route taken by a truck in which 39 bodies were found this week. Belgium's federal prosecutors, who handle cases of terrorism and organized crime, said on Thursday they had opened an investigation into the deadly transport. Initial findings showed the truck passed through the Belgian cargo port of Zeebrugge, from where it crossed by ferry to Britain. The victims - 31 men and eight women, all believed to be Chinese nationals - were found in a refrigerated truck on an industrial estate 20 miles (32 km) east of London. The driver was detained on suspicion of murder. Belgian prosecutors said they were looking into when and where the victims were loaded into the container. Regional British police said a case of human trafficking was suspected. This was not the first fatal migrant transport routed through Zeebrugge - a container with the bodies of 58 Chinese inside found in the English port of Dover in 2000 had also come from the Belgian port. However, in recent years the focus of migrant efforts to reach Britain was the French port of Calais - across the Channel from Dover - offering more than hourly ferry services and an undersea tunnel on the shortest crossing to the United Kingdom. The migrant community in Calais grew to some 6,000 people, most of them in a shanty town dubbed the Jungle, outside Calais until French authorities emptied it in October 2016, saying it was a security and health hazard. Cast adrift and driven away from Calais by the Jungle's closure, many migrants looking for the next closest passage points made their way north to neighboring Belgium, said Stef Janssens at that country's federal center of migration.  MIGRANT ROUTE SHIFTS ""There was a shift of the route to Britain from Calais to Belgium's E40 highway,"" he said, with people trafficking gangs taking control of parking spots where migrants congregate along the motorway leading from Brussels to the North Sea coast. In contrast with Calais, Zeebrugge largely handles cargo with far fewer leisure travelers.  Dogs and heat scanners are used to detect stowaways though they might not be spotted in sealed, refrigerated containers like the one in which the 39 bodies were discovered this week. In 2014, an Afghan migrant was found dead in a container that had arrived in the British port of Tilbury, along with 34 who had survived.

Belgium's federal prosecutors, who handle cases of terrorism and organised crime, said on Thursday they had opened an investigation into the deadly transport. Initial findings showed the truck passed through the Belgian cargo port of Zeebrugge, from where it crossed by ferry to Britain. The victims - 31 men and eight women, all believed to be Chinese nationals - were found in a refrigerated truck on an industrial estate 20 miles (32 km) east of London. The driver was detained on suspicion of murder. Belgian prosecutors said they were looking into when and where the victims were loaded into the container. Regional British police said a case of human trafficking was suspected. This was not the first fatal migrant transport routed through Zeebrugge - a container with the bodies of 58 Chinese inside found in the English port of Dover in 2000 had also come from the Belgian port. However, in recent years the focus of migrant efforts to reach Britain was the French port of Calais - across the Channel from Dover - offering more than hourly ferry services and an undersea tunnel on the shortest crossing to the United Kingdom. The migrant community in Calais grew to some 6,000 people, most of them in a shanty town dubbed the Jungle, outside Calais until French authorities emptied it in October 2016, saying it was a security and health hazard. Cast adrift and driven away from Calais by the Jungle's closure, many migrants looking for the next closest passage points made their way north to neighbouring Belgium, said Stef Janssens at that country's federal centre of migration.  MIGRANT ROUTE SHIFTS ""There was a shift of the route to Britain from Calais to Belgium's E40 highway,"" he said, with people trafficking gangs taking control of parking spots where migrants congregate along the motorway leading from Brussels to the North Sea coast. In contrast with Calais, Zeebrugge largely handles cargo with far fewer leisure travellers.  Dogs and heat scanners are used to detect stowaways though they might not be spotted in sealed, refrigerated containers like the one in which the 39 bodies were discovered this week. In 2014, an Afghan migrant was found dead in a container that had arrived in the British port of Tilbury, along with 34 who had survived. This also had gone through Zeebrugge, but at a time when the scanner was not working.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N2797UL	"(Updates with activists charged, released) By Nita Bhalla NAIROBI, Oct 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda said on Thursday it had charged 16 LGBT+ activists with the crime of gay sex - punishable by life in jail - in what campaigners called an escalating campaign against sexual minorities in the east African nation. The 16 men, believed to be aged from 22 to 35, were taken into custody late on Monday at the office of a sexual health charity where they all worked and lived, fellow activists said. Police said they had found lubricants, condoms and anti-retroviral drugs at the charity, and had conducted anal examinations on all 16 men. ""Based on the medical examination report, it was established that the suspects were involved in sexual acts punishable under the penal code,"" Kampala Police spokesman Patrick Onyango told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Fred Enanga, Uganda's national police spokesman, said the men were charged under sections of the penal code that outlaw gay sex, and that all had been released on police bond. ""They will keep reporting to the police on selected dates pending further guidance from the state attorney's office,"" Enanga said. The charity confirmed the men's release on Facebook. Gay sex carries a possible life sentence in Uganda, one of the most difficult countries in Africa to be a sexual minority with increasingly violent confrontation over sexual freedom. Members of the LGBT+ community say they risk physical attacks in their daily life and routinely encounter harassment, as well as facing prejudice over work, housing and health care. Campaigners have reported a spate of attacks this year - including four murders - with the latest on Oct. 4 when a gay rights activist was bludgeoned to death. Police say they know of no such attacks. Earlier this month, a minister proposed introducing the death penalty for gay sex, a threat retracted by the government after international donors condemned the move. Activists said the raid was a new step-up by police. ""Normally we will hear of maybe one arrest of someone from the community under these anti-gay laws in one month, but it is really unusual to see 16 people charged like this,"" said Frank Mugisha, executive director of Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG). The men all worked for a charity called ""Let's Walk Uganda"", whose offices are on the outskirts of the capital Kampala. They were initially taken into ""protective custody"" after a crowd yelling homophobic slogans surrounded their office, rights groups said. Police said the group was detained after they were alerted to ""illegal activities"" by the community. Under Uganda's British, colonial-era penal code, anyone who has ""carnal knowledge against the order of nature"" - gay sex - or who accedes to anal sex is liable to life imprisonment.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N2797C2	"By Alan Baldwin MEXICO CITY, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Renault will not appeal their Japanese Grand Prix disqualification for breaking the rules on driver aids, the Formula One team said on Thursday. The governing FIA announced on Wednesday that Australian Daniel Ricciardo and German driver Nico Hulkenberg had been stripped of their nine points from the Oct. 13 race in Suzuka. Renault had the right to appeal by a Thursday deadline at the Mexican Grand Prix. ""Since we have no new evidence to bring other than that already produced to demonstrate the legality of our system, we do not wish to invest further time and effort in a sterile debate in front of the International Court of Appeal,"" the team said. ""We have therefore decided not to appeal the stewards’ decision."" Ricciardo and Hulkenberg were classified sixth and 10th in Japan but rivals Racing Point protested against the brake bias system used by the French manufacturer. The stewards concluded that the system ""used innovative solutions to exploit certain ambiguities"" and did not breach the technical regulations. They found, however, that it acted as a driver aid and therefore contravened the sporting regulations. ""In our opinion, the penalty is not proportionate to any benefit the drivers derived, especially when used within the context of a system confirmed fully legal and innovative,"" said Renault. ""It is also inconsistent with previous sanctions for similar breaches, as acknowledged by the stewards in their decision, but expressed without further argumentation."" The disqualification lifted Ferrari's Charles Leclerc to sixth with Toro Rosso's Pierre Gasly and Racing Point's Sergio Perez now seventh and eighth. Racing Point's Lance Stroll is ninth and Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat 10th. Renault stayed fifth overall but the gap between them and Toro Rosso has closed to six points from 18.

But there was scant sign of real progress and Abe reiterated that South Korea would need to keep its promises for ties between the two Asian allies of Washington to improve. Relations between Tokyo and Seoul have deteriorated to their lowest in decades since South Korea's top court last October ordered some Japanese firms to compensate Koreans forced to work in their wartime mines and factories. Japan, which says the matter was settled by a 1965 treaty, calls the decision a violation of international law, and the feud has spilled over into trade and security matters. About 100 journalists were present at the start of talks in Tokyo, the highest-level meeting between the two sides since the row flared. The meeting began with a handshake but no smiles. Abe urged Seoul to keep its promises - a reference to the 1965 treaty - in order to restore relations, according to statement issued by Japan's foreign ministry. ""Our two nations are important neighbours for each other, and keeping in contact over North Korea, bilateral relations and our ties with the United States are quite important,"" Abe was quoted as telling Lee. ""Relations are currently in quite a severe state but should not be left that way. If South Korea can keep bilateral promises, that could be a chance to return to a healthy relationship,"" Abe added. The statement also quoted Lee as saying he shared the view that dialogue was important, while a parallel statement from South Korea's foreign ministry said Lee agreed relations should not be left in their current difficult state. Abe also repeated Tokyo's stance that the South Korean court ruling overturned the basis of two-way ties. “Abe said the South Korean top court ruling is in clear violation of international law and ... fundamentally breaks down the legal framework for Japan-South Korea relations,"" Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Naoki Okada told reporters. In a sign that gaps remain wide, Lee told Abe: ""South Korea has also respected and complied with the 1965 Treaty on Basic Relations and Claims, and will continue to do so,"" according to Seoul's statement. Lee, who was in Tokyo to attend Japanese Emperor Naruhito's enthronement ceremony this week, delivered to Abe a personal letter from South Korean President Moon Jae-in in which Moon called for attempts to resolve the pending bilateral issues, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. Moon and Abe have not held a summit in more than a year and the statements made no mention of any meeting planned between the two. A Japanese government official questioned whether Thursday's meeting would lead to a breakthrough. ""It depends on their (South Korea's) deeds, not words,"" the official told Reuters.  DIFFICULT HISTORY The animosity between Japan and South Korea is linked to the history of Japan's 1910-45 colonisation of the Korean peninsula, the mobilisation of forced labour at companies and women in wartime military brothels, and a row over the ownership of islets in the sea between the two nations. Earlier this year, the dispute escalated when Japan tightened export controls on materials vital for South Korean chipmakers. It then dropped Seoul from a list of countries eligible for fast-track exports, steps angrily denounced by South Korea. The spat has prompted protests in South Korea, where Japanese companies and products have been boycotted, and trade between the two countries has slowed sharply. In August, South Korea announced it would scrap a military intelligence-sharing pact with Japan when it expires next month, just as the allies face rising tensions over North Korea's nuclear weapons programme and increased competition from China and Russia. Further potential flashpoints loom. Thousands of South Korean students and activists are expected to gather on Friday to celebrate ""Dokdo Day"". Dokdo is the Korean name for islets claimed by South Korea and by Japan, which calls them Takeshima. South Korea is also planning to order asset sales of the Japanese companies found liable for damages under last year's forced labour rulings as early as December, which could further sour bilateral relations, analysts said. ""Precautions must be taken to prevent that,"" said Yang Kee-ho, professor of Japanese Studies at Sungkonghoe University.

The two Tupolev Tu-160 strategic bombers touched down at Waterkloof air force base in Tshwane on Wednesday, the South African National Defence Force said. Russia's Ministry of Defence has said the mission is designed to nurture military ties with South Africa. Speaking before dozens of African heads of state at a two-day summit in the southern Russian city of Sochi, Putin called for trade with African countries to double over the next four to five years and said Moscow had written off African debts to the tune of over $20 billion. The first Russia-Africa summit is part of a Kremlin drive to win business and restore influence that faded after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, which backed leftist governments and movements across the continent throughout the Cold War. ""Many Russian companies have long and successfully worked with partners from the most different sectors of the African economy and plan to expand their influence in Africa. We of course will provide support at the state level,"" said Putin. The prize is greater political clout on a continent with 54 United Nations member states, vast mineral wealth and potentially lucrative markets for Russian-manufactured weapons. But Russia is starting from a low base. Although it has enjoyed considerable success selling arms to African countries, Moscow lags far behind competitors in trade terms. Russia says its trade with African countries rose to $20 billion last year, but it did not rank among the continent's top five largest partners for trade in goods, according to Eurostat. That list was topped by the European Union, followed by China, India, the United States and the United Arab Emirates. As it noted the arrival of Russia's warplanes, the South African National Defence Force praised what it said were strong diplomatic links between the countries. ""Our relations are not solely built on 'struggle politics', but rather on fostering mutually beneficial partnerships based on common interests,"" it said in a statement. South African media have been more sceptical about Moscow's return to the continent. ""Russia is the clumsy latecomer at Africa's superpower party,"" ran a Mail & Guardian headline in June. Russia's reappearance was thrust into the spotlight last year when three Russian journalists were killed in the Central African Republic (CAR) while investigating the alleged presence there of a shady Russian private military contractor known as the Wagner group. Putin and CAR President Faustin-Archange Touadéra discussed the investigation into the killings at talks on Wednesday, the Kremlin said. U.S. officials have vowed to counter what they see as Moscow's growing political and economic clout in Africa as well as that of China, which has long had a large economic presence there and began its own series of Africa summits in 2006. Russia and Nigeria signed a deal to supply 12 Russian-made Mi-35 attack helicopters to Nigeria, RIA news agency cited a senior official at Russia's federal military-technical cooperation service as saying on Wednesday. Russia's largest lender Sberbank and its state financial institutions agreed to support trade finance between Russia and African countries with an agreement worth $5 billion. Russia's state nuclear company Rosatom is in talks with Ethiopia to build a nuclear power station there, Interfax quoted the Russian company as saying. On Monday, Putin accused former colonial powers in the West of intimidating African countries to exploit the continent's resources. ""We see how an array of Western countries are resorting to pressure, intimidation and blackmail of sovereign African governments,"" Putin told TASS news agency.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N2785U9	"By Megan Rowling BARCELONA, Oct 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The Green Climate Fund, one of the main sources of finance for developing nations to tackle climate change, is hoping wealthy countries will pledge between $9 billion and $10 billion to refill its coffers at a conference in Paris on Friday. Climate finance analysts said the outcome would be key to building trust with poorer states preparing more ambitious climate action plans which are due to be submitted to the United Nations by the end of 2020. Environment and development groups are calling for at least $15 billion in new commitments for the Green Climate Fund (GCF), saying projects that may use up close to that amount are already in the pipeline, with needs only increasing as the planet warms. Lucile Dufour, international policy advisor with Climate Action Network France, said the GCF replenishment was happening ""at a crucial point in the fight against climate change"", and called on donors to double their contributions at a minimum. ""This is a matter of justice and survival for developing countries and the most vulnerable communities,"" she told journalists, noting the devastation from increasingly wild weather around the world. The fund's executive director, Yannick Glemarec, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation this week's meeting would be a ""success"" if pledges exceeded the $9.3 billion garnered at its first conference in 2014. Since late last year the fund has secured pledges of about $7.4 billion from 16 countries for 2020-2023, with large donors like Germany, France and Britain doubling 2014 contributions. New announcements from some other potentially large donors are expected to raise that figure on Friday, including Japan, Italy, Switzerland, Finland and Belgium. ""It is not easy right now for any kind of financial contributors to dramatically increase their contribution because most of them are facing real budgetary constraints,"" Glemarec said, noting some ""exceptional efforts"" to double donations. Despite total promises of just over $10 billion for the fund's first five years, U.S. President Donald Trump, a climate-change sceptic, refused to deliver two-thirds of his country's  $3 billion pledge. Currency fluctuations meanwhile further cut the actual total available to the fund, to about $7.2 billion. Glemarec and others expressed hope the United States could ""re-engage"" with the fund in coming years. Joe Thwaites, a climate finance researcher with Washington-based World Resources Institute, said domestic politics meant it was ""disappointing but not surprising"" that the United States and Australia had indicated they would not contribute now. He also urged some countries whose new pledges were flat or up slightly, like Canada and the Netherlands, to give more. A report from the U.N. climate science panel showed last year that climate action financing, both from governments and business, had so far been inadequate, Thwaites said. ""There is a very clear sense that we need to see major increases and particularly for adaptation, where the needs are only going to rise.""  MORE FOR THE POOREST? The GCF has allocated some $5.2 billion to 111 projects in 99 countries ranging from green, low-cost housing in Mongolia's polluted capital and a rapid-transit bus system in Karachi using methane to restoring climate-threatened ecosystems in Namibia. It expects to have parcelled out the rest of its initial pot by the end of 2019, Glemarec said, adding he hoped it would be able to grow its project pipeline in future. Aid agencies praise the fund's push to divide its money between projects to reduce planet-warming emissions and efforts to adapt to climate shifts and rising seas, as adaptation has received only about a fifth of global climate finance until now. Glemarec said that since 2015 nearly 70% of the $1.9 billion the fund had allocated for adaptation was for projects in the most vulnerable poor countries, African nations and small island states, stressing the aim was to maintain or raise that share. Liane Schalatek, associate director at the Heinrich Böll Foundation North America and civil society observer at the GCF, said it should increasingly work with approved ministries and agencies in developing states to reach local communities. ""There needs to be a focus on the poorest and most disenfranchised people who are usually not given voice and much opportunity to participate in or benefit from decision-making on climate change,"" she said.

""We have 7.5 billion people and the population continues to grow, so there is a need to eat more vegetables, cereals, and less sugar, meat products,"" said Laurent Freixe, Executive Vice President and head of operations in the Americas. Limited natural resources on the planet and the growing public health problem of obesity are behind the changes Freixe sees as necessary.

This poses a challenge for every large food processor. ""There is a lot more sensitivy on the matter everywhere, not only in Europe or the U.S. We are in a connected world, people have access to information, consumers want to know where raw materials come from, if they were produced ethically,"" he said.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N270708	"By Belinda Goldsmith and Sarah  Shearman ADDIS ABABA/SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A s the brains behind a hydroponics farming system in rural Kenya, 17-year-old Jefferson Kang'acha struggled to get noticed but he now expects the youth climate movement led by Greta Thunberg to bolster other young people on a mission. Kang'acha, a computer technology student, decided to apply technology to farming when his parents were hit by another drought and he came up with an automated hydroponics unit built from recycled waste and plastic bottles. After his first unit produced 2 tonnes of tomatoes, he founded the Eden Horticultural Hub, a social enterprise that now runs four hydroponics systems in his home town of Limuru to supply the local community and lunches to 1,500 school pupils. Echoing many young social entrepreneurs attending two of the sector's big annual events this week, Kang'acha said he was brushed off at first but eventually - similarly to Swedish teenager Thunberg - people started to listen. ""At first it was hard to be heard, particularly as the average age of a farmer in Kenya is about 60,"" said Kang'acha, now 20, speaking on the sidelines of the 12th annual Social Enterprise World Forum (SEWF) in Ethiopia. ""But young people have the advantage of exposure to technology and can bring solutions to old problems, working together with the experience of older people, not as rivals."" A Thomson Reuters Foundation poll released this week found there was rising enthusiasm among young people globally to work for businesses with a mission to do social good. Three in four of about 900 experts surveyed said more young people - under the age of 25 - were interested in working in social enterprises, which tackle a host of issues, from healthcare to climate change.  JOBS WITH MEANING ""We don't just want jobs, we want meaningful jobs,"" said Sabrina Chakori, 27, who set up a ""tool library"" in Brisbane in Australia in 2017 that charges an annual membership fee to borrow donated tools, camping equipment and sports gear. ""The current economic system does not work for the majority of us and we are starting to look at new economic systems,"" she said, adding the library not only used equipment filling up landfills but also cut consumerism. As well as concerns about the global economy and climate change, young entrepreneurs said a lack of jobs and worries about affording their own homes weighed on their generation. Having previously worked for a Wall Street hedge fund, New Yorker Bree Jones decided to use her skills to help people so founded Parity, a social enterprise that converts abandoned homes in Baltimore into affordable ones. Jones, 28, said younger generations have been spurred on by the ""existential threats"" they face, from mass incarceration, police brutality and maternal mortality rates afflicting black people in the United States, to issues like climate breakdown. ""For me it was about using my college education and career skill set and bringing that back into my community in a way that lifts my community,"" Jones told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at the sidelines of SOCAP in San Francisco. ""We realise we have been extracting so much from the earth without replenishing and that is not sustainable – we can do business, make a profit, make money, but also give back to our customers, community and the environment."" A Deloitte report on the rise of social enterprise in 2018 highlighted that for the first time in mature markets, young people believe their lives will be worse than their parents. This was making them question corporate behaviour and the economic and social principles that guide it, with 86% of millennials saying business success should be measured in terms of more than just financial performance. At the same time, technological advances were opening up new opportunities for businesses to positively impact society. Ellen Chilemba, 25, a DJ and founder of Tiwale, a community-based organisation set up in 2012 to give microloans, training and school grants to women and girls in Malawi, said people were starting to take young people more seriously. ""For us, our future is not as visible as for older generations,"" said Chilemba at the SEWF, pointing to the global climate movement spurred by Thunberg.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N2766P5	"By Anastasia Moloney and Christine Murray BOGOTA/MEXICO CITY, Oct 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A rgentina is seeking the extradition from Mexico of a former spy accused of running a criminal organization that sexually exploited women, a move one trafficking survivor said would be a ""historic milestone"" in the fight against the crime. Mexican authorities arrested Raul Martins earlier this month in the seaside city of Cancun following an extradition request from a judge in Argentina, where prosecutors said he faced human trafficking, racketeering and money laundering charges. Argentine prosecutors say Martins, who is a dual Argentine-Mexican national, exploited women and laundered the profits in at least 10 upscale brothels, cabaret bars and nightclubs in Buenos Aires over nearly three decades. The Thomson Reuters Foundation was unable to reach Martins' lawyer, Ricardo Hernandez. In interviews with local media, Hernandez is quoted as saying Martins' detention was illegal and that his case was political ahead of a presidential election in Argentina later this month. ""The organization that Raul Martins led has been working, is working, since the 1990s,"" Alejandra Mangano, federal prosecutor at Argentina's anti-trafficking prosecutor's office, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Alika Kinan, a trafficking survivor who police freed from a brothel in southern Argentina in 2012, said it was significant that someone with links to the government was being sought by prosecutors in such a case. ""The Raul Martins case is a very important and landmark case that shows the relationship between trafficking mafias and political power,"" said Kinan, who heads the Alika Kinan Foundation that supports trafficking survivors. ""We hope the extradition happens because it's going to mark a historic milestone in the fight against trafficking in this country."" Martins graduated from Argentina's National Intelligence School in 1985 and worked at the country's national intelligence agency for more than a decade, according to local media reports. The U.S. State Department's 2019 report on human trafficking said Argentina had ""increased investigations prosecutions, and convictions, including those of complicit officials"", though official complicity remained ""a significant concern"". Argentine prosecutors are investigating possible involvement of public officials in paying for sex from women being exploited or turning a blind eye to sex trafficking and granting permits for bars where the crime is known to occur. ""We believe that in Buenos Aires, and also in other provinces of the country, there are sexual exploitation rings that have important connections in terms of protection allowing them to operate,"" Mangano said. ""There are cases where public officials are clients of such places."" Argentine authorities have convicted 14 public officials including police and one judicial official on charges of human trafficking since 2008, she said.  'TOP SECRET' Martins was ""provisionally detained for extradition"" and is being held in prison in Mexico City, the office of Mexico's attorney general said in a statement, without giving further details. It is unclear when or whether Martins, who took Mexican nationality after settling in the country in the mid-2000s, will be extradited. It takes typically more than a year for extradition requests to be decided, according to legal experts. ""The federal executive has the discretion to decide whether or not to grant the extradition of (Mexican) nationals,"" the statement from the attorney general's office said. Mangano said most of the brothels Martins is accused of running in Buenos Aires had since been shut down. At the height of his activity, he ran a string of establishments with names like ""Extra Brut"" and ""Top Secret"". Most of those who were sexually exploited were women aged from 18 to 30 from Argentina and other countries in South America, including Paraguay, Colombia and Brazil, she said. Argentina's 2008 anti-human trafficking law carries a maximum prison sentence of 50 years, although so far the longest sentences handed down have been from 14 to 15 years, Mangano said. The charges against Martins, 71, involve a criminal complaint filed by his own daughter, Lorena Martins, who came forward in 2011 to detail how the brothels operated, as well as people who worked in the brothels and victims, Mangano said.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N27853B	"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Peter Apps LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - As a contender for the U.S. presidency in 2016, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was besieged with opposition rumour and conspiracy theories. Last week, her most significant contribution to next year's presidential race so far became indulging in the same game, effectively accusing Democratic challenger and Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of being the preferred choice of Russia. In an interview for a political podcast, Clinton did not mention Gabbard by name, but warned that Russia was supporting a particular candidate who might then run as an independent, undercutting the mainstream Democratic challenger and keeping President Donald Trump in the White House. But a Clinton spokesman later confirmed that was exactly who she meant, saying ""if the nesting doll fits"" in an apparent reference to traditional Russian dolls. The dispute between Clinton and Gabbard is not new – the latter earned the fury of the Clintons and those around them by becoming the first female member of Congress to endorse Bernie Sanders in 2015. The tone-deafness with which Clinton apparently felt happy to push allegations of being a foreign ""asset"" at her, however, speaks to a wider challenge facing much of the traditional political establishment in both major U.S. parties and around the world. Not just Clinton but a generation of Western mainstream politicians now find themselves outflanked by the current state of modern politics, not least contenders like Trump with no regard for the previous rulebook. They have yet to come to terms with the changes the evolving social media and news environment bring to politics, and perhaps even more importantly the wider scale of frustration and yearning for new options.  STRUGGLE It is a struggle at the heart of the still deeply inconclusive battle for the Democratic nomination, in which an increasingly tired-looking frontrunner – former Vice President Joe Biden – is clearly struggling, including with a range of conspiracy theories about his family interests enthusiastically fuelled by Trump. Even beyond Gabbard – who is polling less than two percent amongst registered Democrats, and seems unlikely in the extreme to win – the remainder of the Democratic field is more iconoclastic than any slate in living memory. Even if Clinton was correct – and Gabbard is a very unusual candidate, often featured on Russian outlets and openly supportive of Syria's Bashar al-Assad - her interjection may already have backfired. By drawing more attention to Gabbard, she further boosted her legitimacy particularly in the eyes of more libertarian, often wildly offbeat voters and political elements with whom the representative for Hawaii was already gaining ground. Certainly, Gabbard herself was quick to capitalise on the spat with Clinton, calling her the ""Queen of the warmongers"" and telling her to ""get down from her throne"". That, of course, will do little to endear her to the embattled Democratic mainstream – but it will do no harm whatsoever with the voters she really wants to court, left-wing Democrats already angry with the Clintons and the same kind of right-wingers and independents who have also flocked to Trump. Gabbard pointedly denied Clinton's allegation that she plans to stand separately as an independent – although few believe she had a credible chance of getting the Democratic nomination, and she has now alienated many in her own party. The bottom line, however, is that the 38-year-old may well be only at the very beginning of her political career – and may be remarkably well-placed to pick up Trump supporters when he ultimately leaves the White House.  DIVISIONS That Russia is one of multiple forces looking to exploit political divisions in Western countries is not in doubt – and such attempts are clearly widespread and sophisticated. It is also increasingly clear that many anti-establishment political forces – whether Gabbard, ardent British Brexit supporters or swathes of the European right – are entirely open to receiving support from those elements. Simply concentrating on that dynamic, however, will never be enough. Many on the Democratic side may believe that Russian meddling was what tilted the election for Trump, but that is a hypothesis that can simply never categorically be proven. Indeed, by focusing so loudly on that aspect, Democrats like Clinton risk further strengthening the narrative that they are out of touch, and would rather blame an external foe than concede they had lost the argument with many at home. Indeed, no matter what Gabbard and Moscow's intentions might be, redefining the race once again around Clinton and Russia may be amongst the greatest mistakes the Democrats could make. With barely a year until the polls, the party badly needs to use its time to define a robust vision that resonates with voters, around a candidate who is trusted and can take the fight to Trump. Whether they can do that is another question – Elizabeth Warren so far looks perhaps the most likely candidate to do so, and it's striking that her public appearances and comments are heavily skewed towards policy and U.S. domestic politics. Gabbard, however, almost certainly will not go away. And by defining her as a mortal enemy and perhaps a pawn of Moscow, Clinton and those around her may simply be giving her new life. *** Peter Apps is a writer on international affairs, globalisation, conflict and other issues.

An estimated 55,000 social enterprises operate in Ethiopia, the second-most populous country in Africa and fastest growing economy in the region where about a quarter of 109 million people live below the poverty line, according to the World Bank. But the number of ventures set up to do good is on the rise since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came in 18 months ago and vowed to open the economy to private investment, raising hopes of official recognition for the sector and easier access to funds. Kibret Abebe, one of Ethiopia's best-known social entrepreneurs, said the sector would be boosted as Ethiopia hosts the 12th annual Social Enterprise World Forum (SEWF) this week, the first developing country to do so. ""The economy is opening up and we are seeing more social enterprises in Ethiopia,"" said Abebe, first president of Social Enterprise Ethiopia, which was set up last year to advance firms set up to do good that re-invest their profits into their work. ""Scaling up has been a nightmare in Ethiopia and it's been hard to collaborate with the government but I'm optimistic this will change as we have a lot of social problems to fix."" Ethiopia's Education Minister Tilaye Gete said hosting SEWF, attended by more than 1,200 delegates from 50 or so countries, was a sign of change under Ahmed, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize earlier this month. ""This is reflective of the overall change in leadership and mindset across the country,"" said Gete as he officially opened the three-day conference. Abebe, an anaesthetist, was a trailblazer for social enterprise in Ethiopia when he sold his house to set up TEBITA Ambulance more than a decade ago after seeing how many road accident victims struggled to get transport to medical help. TEBITA now runs a fleet of 20 ambulances and a college training paramedics, funding its work by charging patients for journeys, offering training, as well as providing emergency services for the national football team.  HEALTH TO HOUSING Abebe said TEBITA was one of thousands of social enterprises in Ethiopia aiming to help the most needy, with newcomers focused on agriculture, education, health, housing and IT. For example Maisha Technologies PLC is a tech-based social enterprise trialling advanced drones to deliver blood to health centres in rural areas where half of maternal deaths occur. HelloSolar aims to provide rural communities without electricity with off-grid energy and affordable payment plans. Abebe said young people - with 43% of the population aged 15 or under - were playing a key role in advancing new social enterprises, many with tech solutions and hoping to create jobs for the future. A 2016 survey by the British Council - which co-hosts SEWF with local partners - estimated the number of social enterprises in Ethiopia and found about half were led by people aged under 35 while women led more than a quarter of social enterprises. But these firms reported numerous challenges, including the lack of a policy framework with no distinct formal legal form or recognised means to register as social enterprises in Ethiopia. The biggest barrier, however, was found to be financial - accessing capital or obtaining grants - so it was critical to find a revenue stream and one strong enough to support growth. Ellilta Products, for example, was set up 2012 to support sister organisation, Ellilta Women at Risk (EWAR), founded in 1995 to help break the generational cycle of prostitution. Headquartered on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, Ellilta Products' workforce of about 55 includes former prostitutes making jewellery from bullet casing and scarves and soaps that are sold locally and overseas to fund the work of EWAR. EWAR workers visit red light areas in Addis Ababa to encourage women to join a year-long rehabilitation programme of counselling and training while their children go to school. Ellilta Products' General Manager Emnet Mersha Seyoum said so far EWAR has rescued around 1,000 women, with a success rate of 90% not returning to prostitution. Anchilu Alemu, aged about 50, said she was rescued nine years ago after 18 years as a prostitute and this has given her and her daughter a new life. She makes scarves at Ellilta and her daughter went to college and is now married with a child. ""Before prostitution was the only way I could make money. This saved me,"" she said as she pulled at a spool of yarn. Seyoum said it had been hard to get funding in Ethiopia as the government did not recognise or understand social enterprises but she hoped this would change under Ahmed and with the SEWF in Addis, attended by 1,200 people from 58 nations. ""Ideally in the future we want to scale up to grow tenfold so that we can provide jobs to all of the women that we rescue,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N2783AH	By Darya Korsunskaya and Tom Balmforth SOCHI/MOSCOW, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Russia despatched two nuclear-capable bombers to South Africa on a training mission on Wednesday, a flight that appeared timed to coincide with President Vladimir Putin's opening of a flagship Russia-Africa summit designed to boost Russian influence. The two Tupolev Tu-160 strategic bombers were due to land near Johannesburg later on Wednesday, Russia's Interfax news agency cited South Africa's military as saying. Russia's Ministry of Defence has said the mission is designed to nurture military ties with South Africa. Speaking before dozens of African heads of state at a two-day summit in the southern Russian city of Sochi, Putin called for trade with African countries to double over the next 4-5 years and said Moscow had written off African debts to the tune of over $20 billion. The first Russia-Africa summit is part of a Kremlin drive to win business and restore influence that faded after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, which backed leftwing governments and movements across the continent throughout the Cold War. The prize is greater political clout on a continent with 54 United Nations member states, sprawling mineral wealth, and potentially lucrative markets for Russian-manufactured weapons. But Russia is starting from a low base. Although it has had considerable success selling arms to African countries, Moscow lags far behind competitors in trade terms. Russia says its trade with African countries rose to $20 billion last year, but it did not rank among the continent's top five largest partners for trade in goods, according to Eurostat. That list was topped by the European Union, followed by China, India, the United States and the United Arab Emirates. U.S. officials have vowed to counter what they see as Moscow's growing political and economic clout in Africa as well as that of China, which has long had a large economic presence there and began its own series of Africa summits in 2006. On Monday, Putin accused former colonial powers in the West of intimidating African countries in order to exploit the continent's resources. “We see how an array of Western countries are resorting to pressure, intimidation and blackmail of sovereign African governments,” Putin told the TASS news agency.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N2773RA	"(Corrects the last paragraph to say that Greenpeace called for an immediate, not a 10-year, moratorium) OSLO, Oct 23 (Reuters) - China is likely to become the first country in the world to start mining seabed minerals if the international rules for exploitation are approved next year, the head of the International Seabed Authority (ISA) said. The quest for exploiting seabed minerals, such as polymetallic nodules containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese is driven by demand for smart phones and electric car batteries, and the need to diversify supply. The ISA has already signed 30 contracts with governments, research institutions and commercial entities for exploration phase, with China holding the most, five contracts. The body, which was established to manage the seabed resources by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), is aiming to adopt seabed mineral exploitation rules by July 2020. ""I do believe that China could easily be among the first (to start exploitation),"" Michael Lodge, ISA general-secretary, who visited China last week, said. ""The demand for minerals is enormous and increasing, there is no doubt about the market."" There is also interest from European countries including Belgium, Britain, Germany and Poland, as well as from the Middle East. However, no one has yet demonstrated that deep sea mining can be cost effective and some non-governmental organisations have questioned whether it would be possible to reach a deal on exploitation rules next year. ""I think, it's pretty good. I think the current draft is largely complete,"" Lodge said, when asked about prospects of adopting the rules by next July. One of the issues yet to be agreed is proportionate financial payments to the Jamaica-based ISA for subsea mineral exploitation outside national waters. ""We are looking at ad valorem royalty that would be based on the value of the ore at a point of extraction ... The middle range is 4% to 6% ad valorem royalty, potentially increasing over time,"" Lodge said. If the rules are approved, it could take about two to three years to obtain permits to start deep sea mining under the current draft, Lodge said. Canadian Nautilus Minerals had tried to mine underwater mounds for copper and gold in the national waters off Papua New Guinea, but it run out of money and had to file for creditor protection earlier this year. This has not deterred others, such as Global Sea Mineral Resources (GSR), a unit of Belgian group DEME, and Canada's DeepGreen, to continue technology tests and research. In July, Greenpeace called for an immediate moratorium on deep sea mining to learn more about its potential impact on deep sea ecosystems, but the ISA has rejected such a proposal.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L2N2771V3	"(Repeats story from Tuesday with no changes to headline or text) By David Alire Garcia CULIACAN, Mexico, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The mug shot-style photo of Ovidio Guzman that appeared as he was apprehended oozed defiance. Chin jutting out, eyes trained on the camera, the handsome youth bore a strong resemblance to his infamous father, jailed drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman. He had reason to be cocksure. In response to his capture in an upscale neighborhood, hundreds of heavily-armed Sinaloa Cartel henchmen, guns blazing, were pouring into Culiacan, briefly taking the modern city of about a million people near Mexico’s Pacific coast hostage. Within hours they had pried him loose from authorities. It was like nothing Mexico had seen before, a military-style operation that outfoxed and outnumbered security forces, leaving the city shocked and smoldering. The show of strength dashed hopes the cartel was seriously weakened by the life sentence the elder Guzman received in the United States this year. Not only were the new generation of Guzmans, collectively known as Los Chapitos, keeping alive their family's near-mythical outlaw reputation, they were doing it with a brazenness akin to open warfare. ""We're facing a new generation of organized crime that doesn't respect civilians,"" Cristobal Castaneda, head of Sinaloa state security, told Reuters after the attacks. Four surviving sons of El Chapo were already regulars in Culiacan's nightclubs and restaurants, despite U.S. indictments against them, before last Thursday's dramatic act of armed insurrection. A concrete monument in the parking lot of a Culiacan supermarket marks the spot where a fifth son was gunned down in 2008. None of the four are older than their mid-thirties. They have already survived kidnappings, arrest attempts and cartel infighting to establish themselves as the city's most prominent traffickers, with the support of cartel elders. Thursday's attacks showed they were capable of taking on the Mexican army, state police and National Guard. Using a mixture of firepower, speed, discipline and the underlying threat of mass civilian deaths, they won. Castaneda pointed to how over several hours gunmen stormed into businesses and sprayed police with bullets in crowded areas, on a scale unprecedented in the country’s long-running drug war. Remarkably, the government says just 13 people were killed, including a soldier and several cartel gunmen. Finally, a humbled Mexican government was forced to order Ovidio's release, opting against a bloodier confrontation that officials later said could have claimed hundreds of lives. For many, Ovidio's newfound celebrity elevated him, along with his brothers, to the status of Sinaloa Cartel heavyweights, with Ovidio's exploits placing just him a few notches below his father in the pantheon of bandits who outsmarted the government. A so-called narcocorrido – a style of song about the drug trade set to upbeat tuba and accordion rhythms – was released by Sunday, lionizing Ovidio as a ""beast"" and proclaiming that ""the government was mistaken/they don’t know who they messed with.” Despite the high profile antics, it is unclear exactly how much influence the Guzmans have over the cartel their father helped found decades ago, however. Los Chapitos control drug sales in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa, including a growing trade in methamphetamine, according to one official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Earlier this year, a fentanyl laboratory was found in the city, suggesting that the Guzmans also have their eye on the lucrative U.S. opiate business. But the cartel’s bigger interests are still believed to be handled by El Chapo's former partner, Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, a discrete capo in his early 70s who has never been arrested. The businesses Zambada handles move billions of dollars, U.S. authorities say, and are diversified across many sectors in dozens of countries, including even niche markets like wildlife and timber smuggling. Edgardo Buscaglia, an organized crime expert at Columbia University, agrees that Zambada probably still controls the cartel. He described the new generation as more reckless, but certainly not as powerful. In recent years, the relationship between the family and Zambada has been fraught, with his son testifying against El Chapo at his U.S. trial. In turn, the defense argued Zambada was the real head of the cartel, not El Chapo. However, Zambada, who is said to be Ovidio's godfather, apparently supported the assault to release him. A statement issued on Tuesday under the cartel's C.D.S insignia was intended as a show of unity between the factions, Buscaglia said. In one crackly recording circulating online, purportedly of internal Sinaloa Cartel radio communications on Thursday, a supposed gunman celebrates that Zambada was supporting the battle to release Ovidio. Thursday's antics showed Ovidio commanded sufficient loyalty in the organization for fighters to risk their lives to save him, Buscaglia said. And despite the cartel's head-on fight with the state to release him, he predicted Los Chapitos were smart enough avoid sustained confrontation with security forces. ""They know they would lose in the long term,"" he said.  NARCO PRINCES Up until last week, Ivan Archivaldo, estimated to be 35, and Jesus Alfredo were El Chapo’s better-known sons. Locals say both could be spotted in the city’s trendy nightclubs and restaurants clustered around Culiacan’s upscale Tres Rios neighborhood, where Ovidio was briefly detained by a force of about 35 soldiers. Far from hiding in safehouses, they and their friends are known to enjoy tearing through Culiacan’s nearby hills in souped-up all terrain vehicles, two people said. Two dealerships that sell high-end models are located in the city. ""Yeah, a lot of people here know who they are and see them out and about,"" said a young clerk at a clothing shop, asking that her name not be used for fear of reprisals. In 2017, Ivan Archivaldo and Jesus Alfredo were believed to be behind an attack on then-rival Damaso Lopez, a high-level Sinaloa Cartel leader once rumored to be El Chapo’s successor, in the dusty town of Villa Juarez just outside Culiacan. ""It was crazy. The shootout lasted more than two hours. Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta,"" said a local witness, mimicking the sound of gunfire and pointing to where bullet holes remain visible. Two people died, including a pregnant woman. More than a decade ago, Ivan Archivaldo was arrested and jailed, but he was released in 2008 due to what a judge called a lack of evidence. That same year, El Chapo’s eldest son, Edgar Guzman, was gunned down in a supermarket parking lot in Culiacan, the spot now marked by a stone cross. Following the footsteps of El Chapo, who staged two spectacular prison breaks and eluded capture multiple times, Ivan Archivaldo dodged an imminent arrest in 2014 by dressing as a waiter and fleeing through the kitchen of a high-end seafood restaurant in Culiacan, government sources told Mexico's Milenio newspaper. ""It will always be like this,"" Ivan Archivaldo said in an interview published last year in Belgian magazine Knack, when asked if there was a war between the cartel and the state. ""It is the government's job to fight us, by mandate, they have to fight drug cartels,"" he said, adding: “There’s a lot of people who protect me and my family.” (Reporting by David Alire Garcia Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Tom Brown)"	cartel: 0.3148038270313716; culiacan: 0.27274120962359305; pron: 0.2640014083255976; ovidio: 0.24546708866123376; ta: 0.21819296769887445; el_chapo: 0.21469397438155105; chapo: 0.21469397438155105; el: 0.21335027548008909; zambada: 0.19091884673651513; sinaloa: 0.1636447257741558
tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N2782HR	"(Adds fresh quotes from Amnesty's Indonesia chief) By Ed Davies JAKARTA, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo took what appeared to be his biggest political gamble on Wednesday by including controversial former general Prabowo Subianto in the cabinet, his main rival who has long harboured ambitions for the presidency. Prabowo, a 68-year-old former special forces commander, has been accused of human rights abuses and trying to grab power after his then father-in-law Suharto was ousted from the presidency in 1998. An opposition leader during Widodo's first term and with unsuccessful runs for the presidency in 2014 and again this year, Prabowo has now been named defence minister. On the campaign trail, critics said his message, much like U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016, amplified potential threats to the country. In speeches, he often said Indonesia was on the verge of fragmentation, exploited by unspecified foreign powers. But after failing to overturn Widodo's election victory through the courts, Prabowo and Widodo patched things up at a number of meetings in recent weeks - dismaying many of their own supporters. ""Prabowo is a huge gamble for Jokowi. He could turn out to be an excellent defence minister who carries Jokowi’s agenda,"" said Evan A. Laksmana of the Jakarta-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies, using the nickname of the president. ""Or Prabowo could be a disaster, with bureaucratic infighting with the broader security establishment and the politicisation of the defence establishment heading to 2024,"" added Laksmana, referring to the date of the next election Prabowo comes from an elite political family. His father was one of Indonesia’s most prominent economists, serving in the cabinets of the country's first two presidents Sukarno and Suharto. But Prabowo has been dogged by persistent allegations of human rights abuses, in particular during the economic crisis that led to Suharto's downfall in 1998. Suharto's replacement B.J. Habibie has said the second night after he was sworn in, Prabowo showed up at the presidential palace, armed and with a squad of special forces soldiers, and tried to stage a coup. Shortly thereafter, Prabowo was discharged from the army for breaking the chain of command and ordering troops to arrest activists. He has repeatedly denied the allegations against him or said he was following orders. After his swearing in on Wednesday, a relaxed-looking Prabowo said he would immediately head to his ministry. ""I will learn the latest situation and then we will begin work,"" he told reporters.  PRACTICAL BENEFITS It was a far cry from this year's bitterly fought election, when Prabowo had initially refused to concede defeat and eight people were killed and more than 900 wounded during rioting in Jakarta after rallies by his supporters descended into clashes with security forces. For Widodo, his inclusion could have practical benefits by making it easier for the government to push through legislation, given that with the backing of Prabowo's Gerindra party, government support in parliament increases to 74%. Fakhrul Fulvian, chief economist at Trimegah Sekuritas, said Gerindra's inclusion ""will be positive"" for planned economic reforms by ensuring they get firm support from parliament. He noted, however, that by increasing the number of parties in the coalition, it could make it harder to execute reforms. Rights activists say Widodo is going too far in pushing his agenda. ""The president has just handed control of the country’s defence forces to someone implicated in crimes against humanity, including enforced disappearances, by Indonesia’s own human rights commission,"" Usman Hamid, director of Amnesty International in Indonesia, said in a statement. ""The cabinet shows that his (Widodo's) political pendulum is in the direction of efforts to achieve something without caring much for how to achieve it,"" said Hamid, describing the inclusion of Prabowo as the ""politics of accommodation"". Wellian Wiranto, an economist at Singapore's OCBC Bank, called Prabowo's appointment ""a bold bid for national unity.""

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N2780PS	"By Hyonhee Shin SEOUL, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The animosity between Japan and South Korea is entwined with the history of Japan's 1910-45 occupation of the Korean peninsula, the mobilisation of forced labour at companies and women in wartime brothels, and a row over the ownership of islets in the sea between the two nations. Here is an outline of the issues that bedevil their ties:  FORCED LABOUR Last October, South Korea's Supreme Court ordered Japan's Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to compensate some wartime forced labourers. The ruling infuriated Tokyo, which sees the former labourers' right to reparation ceased under a 1965 treaty normalising diplomatic ties. Relations deteriorated when Japan restricted exports of high-tech material to South Korea in July, while a group of former labourers requested a court order to forcibly liquidate Mitsubishi assets for compensation. Thousands of South Koreans protested condemning what they called Japan's ""economic invasion."" Last week, a commercial by Japanese clothing brand Uniqlo stirred a backlash in South Korea as mocking victims of forced labour and comfort women, prompting a parody video featuring a 90-year-old woman who worked for Mitsubishi to go viral. Yang Kee-ho, a professor of Japanese Studies at Sungkonghoe University in Seoul, said the two sides were far apart. ""But it could get even worse if the asset sale of Japanese firms is materialised, so it's good to listen and talk to the Japanese to see if they can find a new, creative way out.""  'COMFORT WOMEN' Reminders of Japan's rule are inflammatory for both sides, but the issue of ""comfort women,"" a Japanese euphemism for women, many of them Korean, forced into wartime brothels, is particularly contentious. Many surviving South Korean victims demand Japan's formal apology and compensation. Japan says the matter of compensation for the women was settled under the 1965 treaty. In 2015, South Korea and Japan reached a settlement under which Tokyo issued an official apology and provided 1 billion yen ($9.23 million) to a fund to help the victims. Taking office two years later, South Korean President Moon Jae-in dissolved the fund, effectively scrapping the agreement, a move that analysts said convinced Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe the South Korean leader was deceitful. Tokyo wants Seoul to remove a statue near the Japanese embassy in Seoul commemorating the comfort women, and another next to the Japanese consulate in Busan. Some comfort women victims continue their weekly protest in front of the embassy.  ISLETS The two countries also have a territorial dispute which flared this month when South Korea flew fighter jets over a set of remote islands marking its Armed Forces Day. The windswept volcanic islets, known as Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima in Japan, are controlled by Seoul with a small band of coast guards although also claimed by Tokyo. The cluster sit astride fertile fishing grounds and possibly enormous deposits of natural gas hydrate that could be worth billions of dollars, experts say. The territorial feud is emotional for Koreans, who say the islands, recorded as part of their territory since 512, were the first land seized by Japan as part of forcible occupation of the peninsula. Japan argues the islands were never part of Korea and it had established sovereignty by the mid-17th century as a stop-over point for its fishermen. Seoul rejects Tokyo's proposal to refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice. In 2017, Japan complained after Moon served visiting U.S. President Donald Trump a dish called ""Dokdo shrimp,"" and invited a comfort women survivor to a banquet for Trump.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N2781RZ	"(Corrects date in dateline to Oct. 22) By Roli Srivastava, Anuradha Nagaraj and Michael Taylor MUMBAI, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Cases of human trafficking in India have fallen sharply according to new government data, but campaigners warned on Tuesday that the figures may not reflect the full magnitude of the crime. South Asia, with India at its center, is one of the fastest-growing regions for human trafficking in the world. Thousands of people – largely poor, rural women and children – are lured to cities each year by traffickers who promise good jobs, but sell them into modern day slavery. Figures released by India's National Crime Records Bureau late on Monday showed around 3,000 human trafficking cases were reported in 2017, a drop of around 60% from just over 8,000 recorded in 2016. The data on trafficking, usually released annually, is seen as crucial to efforts by charities and organisations to stop the practise. Campaigners said a drop in trafficking cases was to be expected partly due to increased vigilance spurred by government-backed awareness campaigns. Campaigner Digvijay Kumar said, though, that traffickers had changed their tactics to circumvent authorities. ""Traffickers have changed their mode of operating, discarding known routes and finding new ones. In many cases, the police are not registering cases under trafficking laws,"" said Kumar of anti-trafficking NGO Institute for Development Education and Action. A spokeswoman for India's home affairs ministry said a series of government measures to address the crime of human trafficking had led to the drop in numbers. Such measures included joint-initiatives by government ministries to stop those profiting from the crime and awareness campaigns to promote increased vigilance at railway stations and bus terminals, she added. ""The success of our awareness programme against trafficking was astounding,"" said an official who declined to be named from West Bengal, a common destination for Indian trafficking victims. Human trafficking in West Bengal plummeted to around 350 cases in 2017 from over 3,500 in 2016, according to the data, released on Monday after a delay of over a year. The figures are broadly consistent with the findings of anti-slavery group Walk Free Foundation that reduced its estimate of enslaved people in India from 18 million in 2016 to eight million in 2017. Campaigners said that estimates of the scale of human trafficking in India should incorporate data on missing children as kidnapped persons. Saji Philip of anti-trafficking charity International Justice Mission said many cases could be going undetected because traffickers increasingly operate online.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N2671GG	By Wesley Langat MACHAKOS, Kenya, Oct 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - For the past two years, Beatrice Ndavi, a 56-year-old farmer in central Kenya, has received vouchers for good-quality seeds and fertiliser, as well as training to improve her yields. The support is offered on credit as part of an insurance scheme that provides security for the farmer’s loan by paying it down if her harvest is damaged by extreme weather. Ndavi, a mother of six from Masii village in Machakos County, explained that in the past, farmers ended up taking out cash loans to cover their needs in an emergency, which they then struggled to pay back. But under the Risk-Contingent Credit (RCC) scheme she is part of, it has become easier for her to keep going, even if the weather is bad, she said. “I get the right farm inputs - quality seeds and fertilisers on time - and I’m not worried about how to repay the loan as it’s insured,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  RAIN-BASED PAYOUTS Millions of rural households in Kenya rely on agriculture for their income, but a warming climate is bringing more intense and frequent droughts, disrupting production. Recurring losses due to sometimes consecutive years of drought, coupled with the high cost of certified seeds and other inputs, have made poor farmers reluctant to invest in their land, organisations working on the RCC project found. Apurba Shee, lead researcher with the Natural Resources Institute at Britain’s University of Greenwich, said the credit scheme differs from traditional insurance as it takes into account rainfall patterns as they unfold rather than paying out only when harvests fail. Remote-sensing satellite technology is used to track rainfall in real-time, and if the average drops below a set threshold in any 21-day period during the growing season, it triggers digital payouts that cover farmers’ loans. The system allows for multiple payments spread throughout the season, as rain volumes fluctuate, Shee said. The RCC programme aims to tackle both credit constraints and risks linked to drought, he said in an interview. “We are getting clear positive indications in term of increased farming investments (and) farmers going back to farming more often, even after a devastating drought,” he added. According to a 2018 survey, nearly 1,200 farmers in Machakos had enrolled in the RCC scheme, with 40% taking out insured loans to buy farm inputs. The average amount they received was 8,500 Kenyan shillings ($82), compared with 6,000 shillings ($58) for traditional loans. In the neighbouring county of Embu, about 800 farmers are taking part in the U.S. government-backed project. Shee said the RCC scheme had now proved itself to be commercially viable and had the potential to be expanded to other parts of Kenya and semi-arid regions across southern and eastern Africa, as well as along the borders of the Sahara.  DWINDLING CAPITAL Before joining the scheme, Ndavi struggled when persistent drought brought water shortages, as she – like many other farmers in Kenya’s drylands – relies on regular rainfall to keep her crops in good health. In 2017, she lost five acres of planted maize worth $100 because of drought. “I didn’t have any other means of recovering my losses, so I went back to my savings to farm again in the following season,” she said, pointing to her land, which was again dry and bare. More severe droughts are leaving many farmers increasingly vulnerable and with less capital to invest in their business, said Sarfraz Shah, project manager at Nairobi-based APA Insurance, which underwrites the RCC scheme. Some farmers are wary of borrowing money, and in other cases, financial institutions are reluctant to lend to them, viewing them as high risk – which feeds into a vicious circle of lower productivity, he noted. “If there is no loan given to these smallholder farmers, they will not be able to farm - but the beauty of this insurance is, if there is bad weather, we pay claims,” Shah said.  CONFIDENCE BOOST Moses Kyalo, another farmer from Masii village, said his farm had become more sustainable since he signed up to the RCC scheme in 2017, giving him access to training and insured credit to help boost production. Last year, he took out a loan for 10,000 shillings and received seeds and fertiliser in lieu of cash. His crops did not do well because of insufficient rain, but the loan insurance paid off part of his losses, he said. “It gave me confidence to increase my investments into farming, unlike before,” he said. Farmers in the RCC scheme also receive training in agricultural practices and finance. Willis Ogutu Odhiambo, an agricultural field officer with Equity Group Foundation, a social arm of Kenya’s Equity Bank which provides the training, said some farmers lacked the knowledge to succeed and could not borrow money to expand. “Or if they get the loans, they misuse it and now they have the burden of repaying the loans,” he said. Liangzhi You, a scientist with the Washington-based International Food Policy Research Institute, which co-led and designed the RCC project, emphasised the benefits of helping farmers prepare for and cope better with climate threats. “If the droughts come, it takes much more resources to deal with than building resilience which is economical and cheaper,” he said.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N2773CO	"(Corrects to add missing word ""of"" in paragraph 28) By David Alire Garcia CULIACAN, Mexico, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The mug shot-style photo of Ovidio Guzman that appeared as he was apprehended oozed defiance. Chin jutting out, eyes trained on the camera, the handsome youth bore a strong resemblance to his infamous father, jailed drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman. He had reason to be cocksure. In response to his capture in an upscale neighborhood, hundreds of heavily-armed Sinaloa Cartel henchmen, guns blazing, were pouring into Culiacan, briefly taking the modern city of about a million people near Mexico’s Pacific coast hostage. Within hours they had pried him loose from authorities. It was like nothing Mexico had seen before, a military-style operation that outfoxed and outnumbered security forces, leaving the city shocked and smoldering. The show of strength dashed hopes the cartel was seriously weakened by the life sentence the elder Guzman received in the United States this year. Not only were the new generation of Guzmans, collectively known as Los Chapitos, keeping alive their family's near-mythical outlaw reputation, they were doing it with a brazenness akin to open warfare. ""We're facing a new generation of organized crime that doesn't respect civilians,"" Cristobal Castaneda, head of Sinaloa state security, told Reuters after the attacks. Four surviving sons of El Chapo were already regulars in Culiacan's nightclubs and restaurants, despite U.S. indictments against them, before last Thursday's dramatic act of armed insurrection. A concrete monument in the parking lot of a Culiacan supermarket marks the spot where a fifth son was gunned down in 2008. None of the four are older than their mid-thirties. They have already survived kidnappings, arrest attempts and cartel infighting to establish themselves as the city's most prominent traffickers, with the support of cartel elders. Thursday's attacks showed they were capable of taking on the Mexican army, state police and National Guard. Using a mixture of firepower, speed, discipline and the underlying threat of mass civilian deaths, they won. Castaneda pointed to how over several hours gunmen stormed into businesses and sprayed police with bullets in crowded areas, on a scale unprecedented in the country’s long-running drug war. Remarkably, the government says just 13 people were killed, including a soldier and several cartel gunmen. Finally, a humbled Mexican government was forced to order Ovidio's release, opting against a bloodier confrontation that officials later said could have claimed hundreds of lives. For many, Ovidio's newfound celebrity elevated him, along with his brothers, to the status of Sinaloa Cartel heavyweights, with Ovidio's exploits placing just him a few notches below his father in the pantheon of bandits who outsmarted the government. A so-called narcocorrido – a style of song about the drug trade set to upbeat tuba and accordion rhythms – was released by Sunday, lionizing Ovidio as a ""beast"" and proclaiming that ""the government was mistaken/they don’t know who they messed with.” Despite the high profile antics, it is unclear exactly how much influence the Guzmans have over the cartel their father helped found decades ago, however. Los Chapitos control drug sales in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa, including a growing trade in methamphetamine, according to one official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Earlier this year, a fentanyl laboratory was found in the city, suggesting that the Guzmans also have their eye on the lucrative U.S. opiate business. But the cartel’s bigger interests are still believed to be handled by El Chapo's former partner, Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, a discrete capo in his early 70s who has never been arrested. The businesses Zambada handles move billions of dollars, U.S. authorities say, and are diversified across many sectors in dozens of countries, including even niche markets like wildlife and timber smuggling. Edgardo Buscaglia, an organized crime expert at Columbia University, agrees that Zambada probably still controls the cartel. He described the new generation as more reckless, but certainly not as powerful. In recent years, the relationship between the family and Zambada has been fraught, with his son testifying against El Chapo at his U.S. trial. In turn, the defense argued Zambada was the real head of the cartel, not El Chapo. However, Zambada, who is said to be Ovidio's godfather, apparently supported the assault to release him. A statement issued on Tuesday under the cartel's C.D.S insignia was intended as a show of unity between the factions, Buscaglia said. In one crackly recording circulating online, purportedly of internal Sinaloa Cartel radio communications on Thursday, a supposed gunman celebrates that Zambada was supporting the battle to release Ovidio. Thursday's antics showed Ovidio commanded sufficient loyalty in the organization for fighters to risk their lives to save him, Buscaglia said. And despite the cartel's head-on fight with the state to release him, he predicted Los Chapitos were smart enough avoid sustained confrontation with security forces. ""They know they would lose in the long term,"" he said.  NARCO PRINCES Up until last week, Ivan Archivaldo, estimated to be 35, and Jesus Alfredo were El Chapo’s better-known sons. Locals say both could be spotted in the city’s trendy nightclubs and restaurants clustered around Culiacan’s upscale Tres Rios neighborhood, where Ovidio was briefly detained by a force of about 35 soldiers. Far from hiding in safehouses, they and their friends are known to enjoy tearing through Culiacan’s nearby hills in souped-up all terrain vehicles, two people said. Two dealerships that sell high-end models are located in the city. ""Yeah, a lot of people here know who they are and see them out and about,"" said a young clerk at a clothing shop, asking that her name not be used for fear of reprisals. In 2017, Ivan Archivaldo and Jesus Alfredo were believed to be behind an attack on then-rival Damaso Lopez, a high-level Sinaloa Cartel leader once rumored to be El Chapo’s successor, in the dusty town of Villa Juarez just outside Culiacan. ""It was crazy. The shootout lasted more than two hours. Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta,"" said a local witness, mimicking the sound of gunfire and pointing to where bullet holes remain visible. Two people died, including a pregnant woman. More than a decade ago, Ivan Archivaldo was arrested and jailed, but he was released in 2008 due to what a judge called a lack of evidence. That same year, El Chapo’s eldest son, Edgar Guzman, was gunned down in a supermarket parking lot in Culiacan, the spot now marked by a stone cross. Following the footsteps of El Chapo, who staged two spectacular prison breaks and eluded capture multiple times, Ivan Archivaldo dodged an imminent arrest in 2014 by dressing as a waiter and fleeing through the kitchen of a high-end seafood restaurant in Culiacan, government sources told Mexico's Milenio newspaper. ""It will always be like this,"" Ivan Archivaldo said in an interview published last year in Belgian magazine Knack, when asked if there was a war between the cartel and the state. ""It is the government's job to fight us, by mandate, they have to fight drug cartels,"" he said, adding: “There’s a lot of people who protect me and my family.” (Reporting by David Alire Garcia Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Tom Brown)"	cartel: 0.31471256923841573; culiacan: 0.27266214527080845; pron: 0.2639248775346977; ovidio: 0.2453959307437276; ta: 0.21812971621664673; el_chapo: 0.21463173721484397; chapo: 0.21463173721484397; el: 0.21328842783531793; zambada: 0.1908635016895659; sinaloa: 0.16359728716248503

""All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN!"" Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to the impeachment inquiry in the Democratic-led House of Representatives focusing on his request that Ukraine investigate a domestic political rival, Democrat Joe Biden. Lynching refers to the murder of thousands of Americans, most of them black, between the 1880s and 1960s, as African-Americans struggled for their rights as U.S. citizens in the aftermath of the Civil War in which Southern states fought in vain to maintain black slavery. ""The president should not compare a constitutionally mandated impeachment inquiry to such a dangerous and dark chapter of American history. It's irresponsible for him to do so, and I hope that he will apologise,"" said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, who is black.

McConnell added that he viewed the House inquiry as ""an unfair process"" that is denying Trump ""procedural safeguards.""

Some Republican allies agreed with Trump's use of the word lynching. ""It shows a lot of things about our national media. When it's about Trump, who cares about the process, as long as you get him.

Trump has a long and controversial history on race including decades-old allegations of discrimination in his family's real estate business. He also championed the death penalty for five black and Latino teens wrongly accused of raping a white woman in 1989 in New York's Central Park, used an expletive to describe African countries in 2018, and singled out black athletes for criticism after they failed to stand for the national anthem while protesting racial inequity.  'HISTORICAL TRAGEDIES' Trump's lynching comment was immediately condemned by critics as unbecoming of a president.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N270768	"By Belinda Goldsmith ADDIS ABABA, Oct 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From ex-prostitutes making jewellery out of bullet casing to drones delivering blood, rising numbers of businesses with a mission to help address social problems are emerging in Ethiopia as the economy opens up. An estimated 55,000 social enterprises operate in Ethiopia, the second-most populous country in Africa and fastest growing economy in the region where about a quarter of 109 million people live below the poverty line, according to the World Bank. But the number of ventures set up to do good is on the rise since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came in 18 months ago and vowed to open the economy to private investment, raising hopes of official recognition for the sector and easier access to funds. Kibret Abebe, one of Ethiopia's best-known social entrepreneurs, said the sector would be boosted as Ethiopia hosts the 12th annual Social Enterprise World Forum (SEWF) this week, the first developing country to do so. ""The economy is opening up and we are seeing more social enterprises in Ethiopia,"" said Abebe, first president of Social Enterprise Ethiopia, which was set up last year to advance firms set up to do good that re-invest their profits into their work. ""Scaling up has been a nightmare in Ethiopia and it's been hard to collaborate with the government but I'm optimistic this will change as we have a lot of social problems to fix."" Abebe, an anaesthetist, was a trailblazer for social enterprise in Ethiopia when he sold his house to set up TEBITA Ambulance more than a decade ago after seeing how many road accident victims struggled to get transport to medical help. TEBITA now runs a fleet of 20 ambulances and a college training paramedics, funding its work by charging patients for journeys, offering training, as well as providing emergency services for the national football team.  HEALTH TO HOUSING Abebe said TEBITA was one of thousands of social enterprises in Ethiopia aiming to help the most needy, with newcomers focused on agriculture, education, health, housing and IT. For example Maisha Technologies PLC is a tech-based social enterprise trialling advanced drones to deliver blood to health centres in rural areas where half of maternal deaths occur. HelloSolar aims to provide rural communities without electricity with off-grid energy and affordable payment plans. Abebe said young people - with 43% of the population aged 15 or under - were playing a key role in advancing new social enterprises, many with tech solutions and hoping to create jobs for the future. A 2016 survey by the British Council - which co-hosts SEWF with local partners - estimated the number of social enterprises in Ethiopia and found about half were led by people aged under 35 while women led more than a quarter of social enterprises. But these firms reported numerous challenges, including the lack of a policy framework with no distinct formal legal form or recognised means to register as social enterprises in Ethiopia. The biggest barrier, however, was found to be financial - accessing capital or obtaining grants - so it was critical to find a revenue stream and one strong enough to support growth. Ellilta Products, for example, was set up 2012 to support sister organisation, Ellilta Women at Risk (EWAR), founded in 1995 to help break the generational cycle of prostitution. Headquartered on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, Ellilta Products' workforce of about 55 includes former prostitutes making jewellery from bullet casing and scarves and soaps that are sold locally and overseas to fund the work of EWAR. EWAR workers visit red light areas in Addis Ababa to encourage women to join a year-long rehabilitation programme of counselling and training while their children go to school. Ellilta Products' General Manager Emnet Mersha Seyoum said so far EWAR has rescued around 1,000 women, with a success rate of 90% not returning to prostitution. Anchilu Alemu, aged about 50, said she was rescued nine years ago after 18 years as a prostitute and this has given her and her daughter a new life. She makes scarves at Ellilta and her daughter went to college and is now married with a child. ""Before prostitution was the only way I could make money. This saved me,"" she said as she pulled at a spool of yarn. Seyoum said it had been hard to get funding in Ethiopia as the government did not recognise or understand social enterprises but she hoped this would change under Ahmed and with the SEWF in Addis, attended by 1,200 people from 58 nations. ""Ideally in the future we want to scale up to grow tenfold so that we can provide jobs to all of the women that we rescue,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N27735Y	"By Nita Bhalla NAIROBI, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda has seen a rise in attacks on LGBT+ people since a minister proposed bringing back the death penalty for gay sex, campaigners said on Tuesday, warning anti-gay rhetoric was fuelling homophobia. The Ugandan government has since denied it is planning to reintroduce an old law colloquially known as ""Kill the Gays"", but LGBT+ rights groups said there had been a series of attacks on sexual minorities after the minister's remarks. Late on Monday, 16 LGBT+ activists were taken into police custody after a mob shouting homophobic slogans surrounded their office and residence on the outskirts of Uganda's capital Kampala. ""What we are seeing recently - these continuous attacks over such a short space of time - is not normal,"" Frank Mugisha, executive director of Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG), told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""We know that they are all hate crimes as attackers made anti-gay comments,"" he said. ""We cannot make a direct link between the minister's statement and the attacks, but such remarks clearly help to stoke homophobic sentiments and hate crimes."" On Sunday, a gay Rwandan refugee was beaten outside his office in Kampala, while on Oct. 13, two transgender women were beaten when they were leaving a nightclub, campaigners said, sharing pictures of the victims' bloodied faces on social media. Police said they had not registered any cases of assaults specifically targeting sexual minorities, but an incident had occurred on Monday and some LGBT+ activists were taken into police custody. ""True there are people whom the community got concerned (about) and reported to the police that there were a group of people who are staying in a house and they looked suspicious,"" said Patrick Onyango, Kampala police spokesperson. ""Police went to the house and they are trying to find out if they are involved in any criminality or illegal activities,"" he said, adding that police have asked the public to be vigilant. Onyango said the attack on the Rwandan refugee had not been reported. The assaults outside the nightclub where the two transgender women were attacked were common, he said. In a statement, the United Nations refugee agency in Uganda confirmed there was an assault on a Rwandan refugee, but said they did not have the full information as the victim was still recovering from his injuries in hospital. ""We trust the Ugandan authorities to ensure that asylum seekers are able to enjoy asylum without discrimination in line with international refugee obligations and the 2006 Uganda Refugee Act,"" it said. Uganda is seen as one of the most difficult countries in Africa to be in a sexual minority with members of the LGBT+ community facing physical violence and harassment to prejudice in getting jobs, renting housing or seeking medical care. Human rights groups have said three gay men and a transgender woman were killed in homophobic attacks in Uganda this year, the latest on Oct. 4, when a gay man was bludgeoned to death. Uganda's Ethics and Integrity Minister Simon Lokodo said on Oct. 10 that government planned to re-introduce an anti-homosexuality bill in parliament. Lokodo's statement was widely reported and international donors to Uganda said they were monitoring the situation closely and stood by the rights of LGBT+ people. A spokesperson for President Yoweri Museveni later denied the plan, saying that Uganda's current penal law - which provides for up to life imprisonment for gay sex - was sufficient.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N2775C9	"(Refiles to fix quotes in headline, day in intro) By Roli Srivastava and Anuradha Nagaraj MUMBAI, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Cases of human trafficking in India have fallen sharply according to new government data, but campaigners warned on Tuesday that the figures may not reflect the full magnitude of the crime. South Asia, with India at its center, is one of the fastest-growing regions for human trafficking in the world. Thousands of people – largely poor, rural women and children – are lured to cities each year by traffickers who promise good jobs, but sell them into modern day slavery. Figures released by India's National Crime Records Bureau late on Monday showed around 3,000 human trafficking cases were reported in 2017, a drop of around 60% from just over 8,000 recorded in 2016. The data on trafficking, usually released annually, is seen as crucial to efforts by charities and organisations to stop the practise. Campaigners said a drop in trafficking cases was to be expected partly due to increased vigilance spurred by government-backed awareness campaigns. Campaigner Digvijay Kumar said, though, that traffickers had changed their tactics to circumvent authorities. ""Traffickers have changed their mode of operating, discarding known routes and finding new ones. In many cases, the police are not registering cases under trafficking laws,"" said Kumar of anti-trafficking NGO Institute for Development Education and Action. India's Home Affairs spokesman declined to comment on the data. ""The success of our awareness programme against trafficking was astounding,"" said an official who declined to be named from West Bengal, a common destination for Indian trafficking victims. Human trafficking in West Bengal plummeted to around 350 cases in 2017 from over 3,500 in 2016, according to the data, released on Monday after a delay of over a year. The figures are broadly consistent with the findings of anti-slavery group Walk Free Foundation that reduced its estimate of enslaved people in India from 18 million in 2016 to eight million in 2017. Campaigners said that estimates of the scale of human trafficking in India should incorporate data on missing children as kidnapped persons. Saji Philip of anti-trafficking charity International Justice Mission said many cases could be going undetected because traffickers increasingly operate online.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26A04S	"By Oscar Lopez MEXICO CITY, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When Mexican entrepreneur Alvaro Velasco came up with the idea of a digital app that provided earthquake warnings he was convinced he had the ideal business that could be a commercial success while helping society. But door after door slammed as he tried to get money and legal assistance from both the government and the private sector to set up his social enterprise, SkyAlert - and he was not alone in this challenge. Mexico was listed on Tuesday as the worst country for social entrepreneurs out of the world's 45 biggest economies in the second global poll of experts by the Thomson Reuters Foundation. It fell 15 places from the inaugural survey three years ago. Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela were the other Latin American countries in the poll, coming 26th, 38th, 39th and 40th respectively in the ranking of 43 nations. Iran and Saudi Arabia were dropped due to difficulties polling there. ""In Mexico City, there's been a brutal slowdown in the atmosphere for entrepreneurship,"" said Velasco. ""With few resources, with zero possibility of accessing public funds ... and always fighting local and federal governments that don't want you to operate, it becomes mission impossible, and that's what we have to fight against in Mexico."" The poll of about 900 social enterprise experts, conducted with Deutsche Bank, found Mexico saw the biggest slump of any country when respondents were asked if social entrepreneurship was gaining momentum there. It dropped 32 places to number 40. Mexico was one of the worst two countries when it came to public understanding the work of social entrepreneurs, leaving them struggling to sell to the public, and also in the bottom two countries when it came to support from government policy. The findings echoed a 2017 study from the Failure Institute, a nonprofit organization that investigates why various endeavours fail, that found more than 80% of Mexican social enterprises had a life expectancy of less than three years. The biggest causes of failure, the study found, were a lack of resources and infrastructure and public and private resistance to investing in social enterprises.  LACK OF UNDERSTANDING ""There's only a small minority of people who see social entrepreneurship as a significant or important value proposition,"" said Alejandro Morales Garcia, from the Eugenio Garza Laguera Entrepreneurship Institute at Mexico's Tecnologico de Monterrey university. ""It's difficult for projects to flourish or be born or to continue to develop if we keep thinking in this same way."" The country of about 130 million people fared badly in most of 12 indicators used to measure political economic, regulatory and cultural factors impacting social entrepreneurs. Topping the poll were Canada, Australia and France. Mexico also came third last when looking at where women were playing a leading role as social entrepreneurs, rating just above Brazil and the United States. Marcela Torres, founder of startup Hola Code, said Mexican machismo was a constant battle for women in social enterprise. When she was first launching her company, which teaches young deportees in Mexico how to code, she said investors would often only address her male co-founder. ""There's an expectation in Mexico that a woman should behave a certain way or talk a certain way,"" Torres told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""I know a lot of women who develop strategies to seem more likeable, so that they're not perceived as hard."" Torres said she also had to struggle with a legal system that offered no real incentives for startups, and a government that offered little support for social entrepreneurs. ""(Social enterprise) doesn't even enter the radar of the Mexican government,"" she said. In June, the administration of leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office in December, scrapped the National Institute for Entrepreneurs (Inadem), a government agency which supported small businesses. Leaders of his Morena party said dissolving the Inadem would cut out the middleman and root out corruption with support going directly to beneficiaries. But Torres and other business leaders were concerned the government hasn't done enough to ensure they get this support. ""The Inadem was a fairly corrupt institution, and I don't think it was a bad decision to dissolve it but the problem is that it's left a gap,"" she said. A representative from Mexico's economy ministry did not respond to a Thomson Reuters Foundation request for comment on the poll. Mexico also ranked among the lowest for access to investment and the ability to sell to businesses, which entrepreneurs said made long-term survival all but impossible. ""It's very difficult to become self-sustainable in Mexico,"" said Velasco. ""It's hard for investors to notice you because they only look at the return on investment, more than leaving a mark on society."" (Reporting by Oscar Lopez.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N2606B0	"By Adaobi Nwaubani and Sarah Shearman ABUJA/LONDON, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When Olamide Ayeni-Babajide discovered an expensive ornament she purchased on a trip abroad was made of old corn husk it opened her eyes to the potential of Nigeria's own waste problem. In 2016 she founded Pearl Recycling, which remodels solid waste such as old tyres into furniture in Lagos, Africa's most populous city with 21 million people and home to one of the world's largest garbage sites. The social enterprise – a business that aims to do good – is also looking to tackle Nigeria's youth unemployment problem, training hundreds of young locals to recycle disused materials, with most them going on to set up their own waste ventures. ""Nigeria is a good place for social entrepreneurs because there are diverse problems to be solved,"" said Ayeni-Babajide. The Thomson Reuters Foundation's second global poll on the best country to be a social entrepreneur found the three African nations among the world's 45 biggest economies surveyed - Nigeria, Egypt and South Africa - failed to make the top 20. But Nigeria came sixth when about 900 social enterprise experts were asked where young people are playing a key role in the growing sector. Egypt came fourth and South Africa 34th in the youth ranking in the poll, supported by Deutsche Bank. In Nigeria - a young country where the median age is about 18 - young people are rising to find business solutions to challenges ranging from poverty to environmental and cultural issues – from illiteracy to pollution – neglected by the government. Facing a youth unemployment crisis – with more than half of 15-35 year olds out of work or not in full-time jobs – a new generation of social entrepreneurs wants to create opportunities and economic prosperity themselves. PASSION AND ENERGY Femi Taiwo, executive director of LEAP Africa, said encouragement from faith-based organisations, motivational speakers, an array of local and international programmes and competitions for young leaders has helped pave the way. ""These initiatives and many more put a spotlight on young people making a change, and inspired many more to jump on the bandwagon,"" said Taiwo, whose Lagos-based youth leadership non-profit provides free training for social innovators. But with this zeal for social entrepreneurship comes risks. ""The enthusiasm, the energy, the drive of young people is incomparable,"" said Atinuke Lebile, 31, founder of Ibadan-based social enterprise Cato Foods. ""However, young people often lack experience and the patience to learn,"" added Lebile, whose biotechnology business aims to reduce malnutrition and poverty by creating fortified food products, such as custard enriched with vitamins A and C. In addition to young people, women are increasingly well represented in leadership positions in social enterprises in Nigeria, which jumped to joint ninth place on this issue from 40th in the inaugural global poll in 2016. Ayeni-Babajide, 36, who worked as an engineer in a male-dominated sector for almost a decade before founding Pearl Recycling, finds Nigerians are gradually getting used to women in leadership positions. ""Women now know their rights and power they possess,"" she said, but added that women still found it hard to access funds. ""The majority of laid down rules are favouring men, especially access to capital. Women need access to funds and an enabling environment devoid of gender profiling to thrive."" Like Nigeria, in Egypt there has also been a concerted push to support young social entrepreneurs, especially since the country's 2011 uprising, said Iman Bibars of Ashoka Arab World, a non-profit organisation that supports social entrepreneurs. Egypt, like Nigeria, has a large youth population with 34% of people under the age of 14 compared to 44% in Nigeria, according to World Bank data from 2018. ""After the Arab Spring there was a lot of interest in the youth, there were a lot of programmes by the government and international donors and CSR [corporate social responsibility] in trying to figure out how to support young people,"" she said. This year Ashoka Arab World launched a Young Changemakers scheme with the British Council and social enterprise Red Ochre to help support females aged 16-20 from rural Egypt develop social enterprise ideas. Egypt rose to 22nd place from 29th three years ago when asked if women were well represented in social enterprises. South Africa was in 23rd place, also up from 29th. ""The reason why young people are excited is it gives them an opportunity to be leaders, it gives them an opportunity to be of help to others and recognition, and this is something that young people did not have before,"" said Bibars. ""Since there are so many social problems in the country and poverty, there is a lot of space for them to innovate."" (Reporting by Sarah Shearman @Shearmans.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N2615D3	"By Zofeen Ebrahim and Elena Berton KARACHI/LONDON, Oct 22  (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From turning organic waste into fertiliser to sharing farm equipment, new businesses seeking to address social problems in Pakistan have made the South Asian nation one of the best performers in the second global poll on social entrepreneurs. Pakistan was one of the three countries, along with Australia and the Netherlands, whose overall ranking improved the most since the first Thomson Reuters Foundation experts' poll on the best countries for social entrepreneurs in 2016. The country advanced 18 spots to place 14th among the world's 45 biggest economies, seen as a nation where social entrepreneurs can make a living and attract good staff. ""The landscape has changed tremendously in terms of openness and receptivity for entrepreneurship,"" said Shaista Ayesha, 39, who heads product development at SEED Ventures, a business incubator based in Karachi. ""Almost all universities have business incubation centres that are either working with the public or the private sectors to support home-grown enterprises."" Interest of young people in the sector was seen as spurring growth, with a youth boom giving Pakistan one of the world's youngest populations, a trend seen continuing until at least 2050, according to the United Nations Development Programme. About two-thirds of Pakistan's 210 million people are younger than 30 with 29% percent aged between 15 and 29. This new generation of young Pakistanis was not only aware of the political and socio-economic challenges faced by the country, but has also found social networks to voice opinions. ""Social issues no longer go unnoticed, and there is a general increase in public eagerness, particularly among the youth, to step up and bring positive change,"" Ayesha said.  YOUTH MOVEMENT As the government struggles to find solutions for a nation affected by poverty, water scarcity, climate change and lack of sanitation, social startups are emerging to fill the gaps. Pakistani banker and economist Ishrat Hussain, adviser to Prime Minister Imran Khan for Institutional Reforms and Austerity, said he was not surprised by the poll results. Hussain cited microfinance institutions, business schools and the digital economy for supporting entrepreneurship. ""There are higher education institutions that have set up entrepreneur centres which are arming people who are not formally trained with business tools, especially women, farmers, youth ... people otherwise neglected,"" he added. Most social enterprises in Pakistan are headed by young entrepreneurs. About one-fifth are led by women compared with 5% of mainstream companies, according to British Council research. Neelum Hassan, a 26-year-old industrial design graduate, founded her social enterprise, Aerosync, in 2016 to design and manufacture products with a social or environmental impact. Her first project is a design for a lightweight, solar-powered mobile cart with foldable counter that converts into a shelter for the thousands of street vendors in Pakistani cities. Street and mobile vending lets people set up businesses with minimal outlay and no paperwork, but they have increasingly faced crackdown from authorities for not having licences. Her plan would provide a ready-made package with registered carts, allocated space and affordable lease schemes. Hassan won the ""Most Promising Woman-Led Business"" award at the Global Clean tech program set up by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and the $15,000 prize money went towards developing a small manufacturing line, she said. ""I personally won't call this a success story because the journey has just begun,"" Hassan said. Improved access to local and international investment - with Pakistan jumping 24 places to 9th place in the latest poll, conducted in partnership with Deutsche Bank - has helped many young social entrepreneurs get their ideas off the ground. Support group Impact Link was launched in December 2018 with backing from the Scottish government to support a small number of social enterprises moving beyond the early growth stages. In the latest round of funding, it gave 4,000 pounds ($4,946) each to five startups to scale up their business. These included TrashIt, which is working on collecting organic waste from food vendors and turn it into fertiliser, and Good Earth, which is behind sharing platforms for farm equipment, often beyond the means of poor farmers. SEED Ventures co-founder Faraz Khan said a proposed law to provide a legal definition for social enterprises would also help attract more foreign investors to Pakistan once approved. ""Once under a legal umbrella, they will be able to attract global impact capital and philanthropic funding,"" said Khan. Ahad Nazir, head of the Centre for Private Sector Engagement at Pakistan's Sustainable Development Policy Institute, said the law would give certainty to investors and social entrepreneurs. ""Some of the companies claiming to be social enterprises are not actually social enterprises, and some companies that are actually social enterprises don't know they are,"" he said. Ishrat Hussain, however, disagreed. ""I think it's a bit premature to gag these entrepreneurs with a legal framework. Let them bloom and flourish, and when they reach maturity, then rein them,"" he said. ""You should not suppress their creativity at this stage.""

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N25T44I	"By Anastasia Moloney MEDELLIN, Colombia, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - G rowing up in a gang-ridden hillside slum in Colombia's second city of Medellin, Bryan Estiven Carmona knew becoming a street drug dealer was far more likely than getting a decent job. ""The idea of earning a quick, easy buck by working for the gangs is a common problem where I live. The temptation is always there,"" said 21-year-old Carmona. Yet against the odds, Carmona landed a job last year as a software tester with the Medellin office of Arbusta, an Argentine tech company that does social good. He is one of about 30 young men and women hired by Arbusta, which aims to give jobs to unemployed people from poor backgrounds, with no work experience or university education. Arbusta and 80 other companies, including local and foreign social enterprises, have set up shop at Ruta N, a government-funded innovation center in the city of 2.5 million people once known as the world's murder capital. Since then Ruta N has emerged as a leading hub for social entrepreneurship in Latin America, making the city one of world's hot spots for social entrepreneurs according to a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll on Tuesday. ""Here there's significant political will to drive social innovation and entrepreneurship,"" said Maria Ines Londono, Arbusta country manager. ""Ruta N is an oasis in the midst of difficult neighborhoods."" The Thomson Reuters Foundation's second global poll of experts on the best countries for social entrepreneurs, supported by Deutsche Bank, found Medellin among the top four city hot spots for business leaders seeking to do good. The three others were Berlin, London, and Santiago. In the inaugural poll in 2016, experts named Berlin, London, Hong Kong, and Santiago as the global city hot spots.  VIOLENT HISTORY It is a big turnaround for Medellin, the epicenter of Colombia's drug wars of the 1980s. ""We've had to become resilient and work together to move the city forward, which creates a conducive environment for entrepreneurship,"" said Alejandro Franco, head of Ruta N, sitting in a co-working place in the building. Scattered across a warren of slum areas are numerous examples of Medellin's social innovation, driven by consecutive mayors over the past two decades and funded by city hall. New schools, public libraries, open-air gyms and landscaped parks have been built in once once-neglected, no-go slum areas. Medellin's much copied cable car transport system ferries residents up and down hillsides, connecting slum dwellers with the rest of the city in a quick and affordable way. Social entrepreneur Matt Alexander said Medellin's tradition of innovation and entrepreneurship were key reasons for locating his U.S. company's international headquarters there. ""We wanted to be in an environment where public officials and others were accustomed to pushing the envelope in terms of thinking of new solutions for old problems,"" said the co-founder of Suyo, which uses technology to help poor families formalize their land and property titles. Ruta N has supported dozens of social and tech businesses over the past decade by offering free mentoring opportunities and workshops on finance and technology, and help with access to funding and low-interest loans. ""Ruta N is a hub that allows you to connect. It helps being under one roof,"" said Andres Castellon, finance director at likeU, a Colombian outsourcing and call center business that employs women and single mothers from poor neighborhoods. While Medellin fared well in the poll as a hot spot, Colombia's overall ranking in the list of best countries for social entrepreneurs dropped 25 places from three years ago to 39 out of 43 countries. In Colombia, social enterprise is a relatively new concept, emerging about five years ago. Experts said many businesses had set up in an informal way without government support. Colombia does not define social enterprises by law as businesses with specific legal and tax treatment. Paula Zapata, who heads the Medellin mayor's office for economic development, said the city's violent past had led to a tradition of the public sector, mayor, business leaders and universities coming together to solve social problems. This has forged an environment where social entrepreneurs can build partnerships with local government and academia. ""In the midst of adversity is when creativity emerges, it is when social innovation is born,"" Zapata said.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26E53E	By Sarah  Shearman LONDON, Oct 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Whether it is building schools from plastic waste or opening a cafe staffed by trafficking survivors, social entrepreneurs find innovative and creative ways to solve a diverse range of environmental and social problems through a business lens. As social entrepreneurship gains traction around the world, misconceptions about the work persist, according to the findings of the Thomson Reuters Foundation's second global poll on the best countries for social entrepreneurs. The survey of about 900 social enterprise experts found more than half - or 54% - said the public did not understand what they did. This compared to 58% in the inaugural poll in 2016. Here are six frequently asked questions about the sector: 1. What is a social entrepreneur? There is no universally accepted definition, but broadly a social entrepreneur can be described as someone who uses commercial strategies to tackle social and environmental problems, prioritising social good while pursuing financial gain to sustain their venture and its impact. 2. Do they run businesses or charities? Social entrepreneurs can structure their organisations as non-profit or for profit. Typically any profits generated from the business are reinvested to advance their stated social cause or benefit their community. 3. When did the term become popular? Bill Drayton is said to have coined the phrase in the 1980s when he founded his U.S.-based non-profit Ashoka with the aim of supporting individuals looking to make positive social change though entrepreneurial means. Social entrepreneur started being more widely used in the 1990s amid a drive by co-operatives and community enterprises wanting to use businesses to create social change and an increase in conscious consumerism. However, over time it has evolved into an umbrella term often used to describe a broad range of activities from mainstream business that has a social impact to individual activism. Within the sector there is perennial debate over whether a more concrete definition would help or hinder the sector. 4. Do governments support social entrepreneurs? More nations are considering laws to promote social entrepreneurship, with many implementing legal definitions, tax incentives and funding to businesses looking to do good. Britain has a specific business structure for social enterprise, offers tax breaks and this year expanded its law incentivising government to buy products and services from ethical businesses. This year Thailand implemented a law to give tax breaks to registered social enterprises, who commit to reinvesting 70% of their profits, while Ireland published its first social enterprise policy for social enterprises to help build awareness and growth. While government support and recognition are often welcomed, there is continued debate over whether regulation could hamper creativity and innovation within the nascent sector. 5. How are they funded? Social ventures typically generate income from trading products or services. Like charities they can seek grant funding and, like private companies, they can get investment in various forms, such as seed capital or equity. There are many funds designed to specifically help businesses that deliver social impact, known as impact investing –  a fast growing field of finance estimated to amount $502 billion, according to Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN), an industry body. Other ways that social enterprises can raise funds include crowdfunding, community investment funds and competitions. 6. What are some of the best known social ventures? Some of the most famous social businesses include Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, Britain's the Big Issue, which hires homeless people to sell streetpapers and sparked a list of similar organisations globally, and India's Barefoot College, which aims to improve life in rural villages around the world by training women skills in solar engineering, healthcare and water testing.

The Kremlin has said it expects 47 African leaders to converge on the Black Sea city of Sochi for the Oct. 23-24 event, Moscow's first Russia-Africa summit and part of an ambitious push for influence and business in Africa. For Moscow, the prize is greater political influence on a continent with 54 United Nations member states, sprawling mineral wealth, and potentially lucrative markets for Russian-manufactured weapons. The world's largest wheat exporter, Russia is also looking to ramp up its supplies of grain and fertiliser to meet demand that is rising in step with Africa's booming population. U.S. officials have vowed to counter what they see as Moscow's growing political and economic clout in Africa as well as that of China, which has long had a large economic presence there and began its own series of Africa summits in 2006. In December, then U.S. national security adviser John Bolton accused Moscow of ""corrupt"" and ""predatory"" business practices and of selling arms and energy in exchange for votes at the United Nations. Moscow denies that. On Monday, Putin gave the clearest idea yet of his pitch to African countries, warning of rising competition over Africa. Turning the tables on the West, he accused it of intimidating African countries to exploit the continent's resources. ""We see how an array of Western countries are resorting to pressure, intimidation and blackmail of sovereign African governments,"" Putin told the TASS news agency. He did not name specific countries, but said he was referring to former colonial powers on the continent.  ARMS FAIR ""They are using such methods to try to return lost influence and dominance in their former colonies in a new guise and rushing to pump out maximum profits and to exploit the continent,"" he said. By contrast, Putin said Russia was ready to offer help without ""political or other conditions"" and to embrace the principle of African solutions for African problems. During its Cold War struggle with the capitalist West, Soviet Moscow developed close ties with many African countries, backing for instance post-colonial independence movements. Many of those ties lapsed after the 1991 Soviet breakup. But Moscow's ties to Africa are now on the up, Putin said, pointing to military technical cooperation accords that Russia has with more than 30 African states which it supplies arms to. Russia's new role in the region was thrust into the spotlight in July last year when three Russian journalists were killed in the Central African Republic while investigating the alleged presence there of a shady Russian private military contractor known as the Wagner group. Putin will co-host the summit with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Russia plans to put on an arms fair at the summit, showing Russian-made weapons including its S-400 missile defence system, other air defence systems as well as non-military equipment, according to the Almaz-Antey arms manufacturer. In trade terms, though, Moscow lags far behind competitors. Russia says its trade with African countries rose to $20 billion last year, but Russia did not rank among the continent's top five largest trade in goods partners, according to Eurostat. That list was topped by the European Union, followed by China, India, the United States and the United Arab Emirates.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N2760V1	"By Michael Taylor KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 21 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Local leaders in Indonesia must get involved with young people to tackle the trash problem that blights the nation's islands and surrounding seas, a leading Asian youth environmental activist said on Monday. The archipelago of 17,000 islands is the world's second biggest contributor of plastic pollutants in the oceans, according to government officials. A fast-growing population and a coastline with many cities has created a ""perfect storm"" for trash finding its way into the surrounding seas, according to green groups, with garbage collection and recycling failing to keep pace with development. ""Youths can drive bigger and faster changes,"" said Swietenia Puspa Lestari, 24, an environmental engineer who co-founded the Indonesian youth-led non-government organisation Divers Clean Action (DCA) https://www.diverscleanaction.org in 2015. ""They have no hidden agenda and only care about the future,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Jakarta having been inspired by teenage activist Greta Thunberg's angry speech at the United Nations last month. Lestari, a keen scuba diver, helped to set up DCA when she was a student at Bandung Institute of Technology and the group now has about 1,500 volunteers in Indonesia and across Southeast Asia, working with communities and organising youth workshops. DCA also initiated the #NoStrawMovement online campaign in 2017 to ban single-use plastics, which was taken up by hundreds of restaurants, and the group teamed up with fashion giant H&M so collected marine debris is recycled and used in some clothes. Lestari is increasingly being recognised for her work, listed as one of the BBC's 100 inspiring and influential women for 2019 and taking part in Norway this week in a youth leadership summit run by non-profit Sustainable Ocean Alliance. But to make progress Lestari said it was critical that local and not just national leaders get more involved to tackle the growing problem of waste - and often it was young people who had the solutions. The rubbish problem on the resort island of Bali was so bad two years ago that officials declared a ""garbage emergency"", while Jakarta pledged up to $1 billion a year to reduce marine plastic debris by 70 percent by 2025. This national action plan encouraged local governments to find solutions for their areas and regions, and this opportunity should be seized on, Lestari said. ""For the national government, they need to invest in more recycling facilities on islands other than Java because many of our volunteers collect waste but ... it is too costly to transport their waste to Java,"" she added. The DCA started out by working with communities and businesses on a chain of islands in Kepulauan Seribu, known as Thousand Islands, by the coast of the capital Jakarta. But the group now works with and educates communities in most provinces across the archipelago about good waste management, conducts clean-ups, and works with businesses and authorities to tackle marine waste and promote recycling. As well as teaming up with universities on research projects, DCA volunteers give talks at schools, arrange recycling collections, and promote reusable cutlery and food containers. ""Indonesia's youth movement is already there but it needs more room to collaborate with local governments ... sometimes they are seen as not knowing anything and just told to go back to their schools,"" said Lestari.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N27610H	"By Rina Chandran PENANG, Malaysia, Oct 21 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - H ousing millions of refugees returning to Afghanistan is one of the biggest challenges facing the country as it attempts to meet the basic needs of its people amid the world's longest-running war, a senior government official said. There are more than 2.6 million registered refugees in the world from Afghanistan, the highest number after Syria, according to the United Nations. In addition, more than two million have been internally displaced by the ongoing conflict. Hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees are being forced back, or returning of their own accord and struggling to find housing in the cities where they often settle for jobs, said Abdul Baqi Popal, the deputy minister of municipalities. The government has made affordable housing a priority, with the aim of giving 1 million ""Occupancy Certificates"" for informal settlers over the next three years, he said. ""The aim is to formalise informal settlements, which are largely on government land. But the government has low financial and management capacity to implement the plan, so the pace is slow,"" he said on the sidelines of a U.N. urban forum in Penang. ""The certificate will give them the right to occupy the plot without eviction for five years, after which if they meet certain conditions, they can get a land title that gives them full ownership,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. All certificates will be in the name of both the husband and wife - and in the case of widows, the name of the woman, which is unusual in Afghanistan, he said. Four decades of war have uprooted millions of Afghans from their homes, and sent them to seek refuge elsewhere in the country, or in neighbouring Pakistan and Iran. About 2.4 million displaced Afghans have returned to Afghanistan since 2014, according to U.N. estimates. Returnees generally experience a deterioration in livelihood opportunities and wages after returning to Afghanistan, according to a study published this year by the World Bank and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). They also have limited housing options, urban experts said. Under the City For All programme launched in 2016, the Afghan government has committed to urban planning and land management, including surveying and registering properties in urban areas. The government is using mapping tools to collect land data and, under a presidential decree issued last year, is registering properties and informal settlements for Occupancy Certificates, said Popal, who oversees 165 municipalities. More than 70% of homes in urban areas are informal or without a title, said Popal, who has previously worked at UNHCR and UN-Habitat, the settlements agency. ""Giving security of tenure to residents is important for trust building and greater economic stability, because they will pay taxes, and that will boost government revenue,"" Popal said. The government has a land bank of about 400,000 hectares, and plans to allocate some of it to build low-cost housing for returning refugees and migrants from rural areas, he said. Funding could come from aid agencies and the private sector. ""The country has been in war for four decades - the economy is poor, government capacity is limited, our options are few,"" he said. ""But with housing and tenure security, people can invest in their homes, they can make plans, and try to move forward with their lives,"" he added.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26B44A	"By Kieran Guilbert LONDON, Oct 21  (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A landmark legal challenge will be filed in Britain on Monday over cotton imports from Uzbekistan in a case lawyers say could pave the way to stop slave-made goods entering the European Union (EU). The legal action says imports of Uzbek cotton into EU nations are unlawful because the bloc has applied preferential tariffs without investigating the human rights situation in Uzbekistan or its compliance with international law obligations. This violates EU rules and means many of its 28 members are facilitating a trade in cotton produced by a state-driven system of forced labour, according to the Uzbek-German Forum for Human Rights (UGF), the civil society group behind the case. The Central Asian nation has acknowledged the use of forced labour in its cotton harvest, and vowed to ""eradicate"" the problem. The lawyers behind the case hope it will succeed in London's Administrative Court - part of the High Court of Justice - and be referred to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg where any decision or ruling would be legally binding across the EU. Such action could range from forcing the EU to conduct due diligence into Uzbekistan's cotton production to a ruling that would effectively stop the entry into the bloc of goods known to be produced by forced labour, said lawyers supporting the case. ""This approach is unprecedented ... it aims to disrupt the unhindered importation of forced labour cotton into Europe,"" said Gerry Liston, legal officer at Global Legal Action Network (GLAN), a Britain-based charity helping UGF with the case. ""If successful, it would have implications for all sorts of goods tainted with forced labour (in the EU),"" he added. Liston pointed to a 2016 U.S. law that allows customs officials to seize and detain goods suspected to have been made by slave labour, and said a positive ruling could drive the EU's legislative bodies to adopt similar measures affecting the bloc. The case comes at a vital time for EU-Uzbek relations as the bloc is negotiating an agreement with Uzbekistan that would see preferential tariffs extended to its textile exports, he added. A spokeswoman for trade matters with the European Commission (EC) - the EU's executive arm - said it did not comment on legal proceedings in front of national courts. ""As regards developments in Uzbekistan, we follow them closely, as this is relevant for our overall trade engagement,"" she said, adding that the EC followed the U.N. International Labour Organization (ILO) on the application of work standards. The ILO last year said 93% of those who worked in the 2018 Uzbek cotton harvest did so voluntarily, and the systematic recruitment of students, teachers, doctors and nurses had ended - although this was disputed by human rights groups such as UGF. In response to a request for comment put to Britain's international trade department, a spokesman said the government ""does not generally comment on ongoing or potential litigation"". Last year Britain, which gives preferential tariffs to Uzbekistan, imported 360,000 pounds ($455,000) of Uzbek cotton, - 0.1% of its total cotton imports in 2018 - state data showed.  UZBEK COTTON COMMITMENT The annual cotton harvest in Uzbekistan is the world's largest recruitment operation, with about 2.6 million people temporarily picking cotton every year, according to the ILO. Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov, who has been opening up the country since taking office in 2016, has vowed to stop thousands of students, teachers and health workers from picking the harvest, a practice widely condemned as forced labour. ""The government of Uzbekistan remains fully committed to eradicating forced labour in the cotton harvest,"" Erkin Mukhitdinov, first deputy minister at the country's labour ministry, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation via email. ""We have taken a number of steps including increased wages, improved working and living conditions, reduced areas allocated for cotton production,"" he said, without responding directly to a request for comment on the upcoming court proceedings. However, Berlin-based UGF last year said in a report that state-imposed forced labour was still ""systematic and massive"". Under a 2012 EU regulation, Uzbek cotton imports receive a preferential tariff under the Generalised Scheme of Preferences, which seeks to facilitate trade with certain developing nations. But the legal motion said this regulation was void as a matter of EU law, and cannot be applied by Britain or any member state of the bloc to cotton imports from Uzbekistan. UGF said this was because the EU had not assessed the human rights implications of applying tariffs to Uzbek cotton nor considered the nation's compliance with an ILO convention on forced labour to which it is a party. UGF Director Umida Niyazova said she hoped the legal action would attract international attention and influence Uzbekistan's government to change the ""system of forced labour"". ""Any kind of global pressure at this point ... at this time ..  could be very effective,"" she said. ""This case could be the last straw, and an important moment for the Uzbek people.""

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N2724HG	"By Annie Banerji HYDERABAD, Oct 18 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Thought mobile phone towers were just for calls and messages? They can also help predict rainfall, telecoms experts said on Friday, a potential game-changer for farmers in developing countries such as India and Sri Lanka. Many emerging economies cannot afford sophisticated forecasting tools such as ground-based radar and rain-gauge networks, making it harder to predict seasonal rains that are the lifeblood for farmers in many Asian countries. ""Weather information - that's the number one need farmers have more than anything else,"" said Daniele Tricarico, who works on agritech at the mobile communications industry body GSMA. ""We are trying to use very useful mobile operator data to provide better, enhanced services to small-holder farmers for climate resilience,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at an agricultural conference in Hyderabad in south India. Mobile phone towers transmit radio signals that are disturbed when it rains, providing data that enables local weather agencies to improve the accuracy of their rainfall predictions. The sheer number of mobile phone towers means the data can help provide forecasts of up to 90% accuracy, said Tricarico, filling the equipment gap at no extra cost and giving more location-specific, high-resolution data than satellites provide. The forecasts can be sent to farmers through calls and text messages, helping them plan when to sow their seeds or use fertilisers, said Damitha Gunawardena, digital inclusion manager at Sri Lanka's largest mobile phone operator, Dialog Axiata. Improved forecasting is key to helping farmers deal with the impact of climate change, which is making weather patterns harder to predict, he said. According to the World Bank, climate change effects could cost India 2.8% of its GDP and reduce the living standards of nearly half the country's 1.2 billion population by 2050. ""If you talk to any farmer, they'll say climate has been changing so much that they have no idea what to expect any more,"" said Gunawardena. ""And that's making farmers move out of agriculture."" Improved access to data could also encourage greater uptake of crop insurance among small-scale farmers, most of whom are uninsured, he said, providing a crucial safety net as climate change increases the risks around agriculture. Currently, the most popular insurance schemes in the region are based on satellite imagery or agents visiting fields in person. Using mobile phone towers would allow insurers to pinpoint where rain has fallen more accurately, said Gunawardena, calling it a ""game-changer"" for farmers. In India, where agriculture makes up about 15% of a $2.5 trillion economy, farmers are often on the front lines of climate change impacts - from severe droughts, unpredictable rainfall, frequent floods to powerful cyclones. The heaviest monsoon rains to lash India in 25 years triggered floods that killed hundreds in late September. It also led to crops being washed away or rotting. While the United States and some European countries have begun to use mobile phone networks commercially to predict rain, developing nations may take another few years, said Tricarico. Several hurdles stand in the way, including customising softwares and algorithms to specific climates, regulatory permissions and chalking out business models, he said. In January, Boston-based ClimaCell partnered with Mumbai-based charitable foundation Tata Trusts with the aim to start such a service in India. Pilot projects are under way in Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. ""Results have been promising so far. And since we know it can be done, it's only a matter of time,"" said Dialog's Gunawardena.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_KBN1WX0NO	"By Rami Ayyub JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Secretary of State Mike Pompeo underscored U.S.-Israeli efforts to counter Iran in talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, in an apparent attempt to ease Israeli concerns that Tehran could exploit a U.S. military pullback in Syria.  Pompeo and Netanyahu met in Jerusalem hours after Turkey agreed with the United States to pause its offensive on Kurdish forces in Syria.  Thursday's pause, brokered in Ankara by a U.S. team including Pompeo and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, gives Kurdish forces five days to withdraw from a ""safe zone"" Turkey had sought to capture. Pompeo's subsequent visit to Israel was seen as an attempt to assuage Israeli concerns that a U.S. drawdown could expose it to attacks by Iran or its proxies. Turkey attacked the Kurdish YPG militia in Syria last week after President Donald Trump pulled a U.S. contingent out of the way, creating a new front in Syria's eight-year war and prompting 200,000 civilians to flee. Israel sees Syria's Kurds, once U.S. allies, as a counterweight to Islamist insurgents in northern Syria. It also worries that its arch-foe Iran or local allies could fill the vacuum left by the United States.  The Kurds responded to the U.S. withdrawal by inviting Syrian government forces, backed by Moscow and Tehran, into towns and cities they control. Pompeo said he and Netanyahu discussed ""all the efforts we've made to push back against the threat not only to Israel but to the region and the world from the Islamic Republic of Iran"". ""We shared our ideas about how we can ensure Middle East stability together, and how we would further our efforts to jointly combat all the challenges that the world confronts here in the Middle East,"" Pompeo told reporters with Netanyahu by his side.  Asked for his reaction to the pause in Turkey's offensive, Netanyahu said: ""We hope things will turn out for the best.""  Later on Friday, Pompeo goes to Brussels to meet NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.  ISRAELI CONCERNS  Interviewed by The Jerusalem Post after meeting Netanyahu, Pompeo said Israel had the right to defend itself. “Our administration’s been very clear,” he said. “Israel has the fundamental right to engage in activity that ensures the security of its people.""

Officials close to Netanyahu are quick to talk up Trump's pro-Israel policies, such as quitting the Iran nuclear deal and recognizing Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and the Golan Heights as Israeli-annexed. However, his Syria about-face was the latest in recent steps that have stirred discomfort within Netanyahu's conservative cabinet, which had previously seen itself and the Trump administration as marching in lock-step. Indeed, Trump's recent diplomatic outreach to Tehran and firing of hawkish National Security Adviser John Bolton have cast a cloud over Netanyahu, who highlighted in two inconclusive Israeli elections this year what he described as his close relationship with Trump.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N27252I	"By Greg Stutchbury TOKYO, Oct 18 (Reuters) - As much as Rassie Erasmus and his Springboks coaching staff have tried to dampen predictions they will look to bludgeon Japan into submission in the Rugby World Cup quarter-final on Sunday, that is exactly what Jamie Joseph expects them to do. Joseph's Brave Blossoms qualified for their first quarter-final after they won Pool A with a scintillating style of up-tempo rugby that included wins over Ireland and Scotland. The Springboks, who were beaten by Japan at the 2015 tournament in the largest upset in World Cup history, however are not going to allow their opponents to play their brand of organised chaos at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday at 7:15 p.m. (1015 GMT). ""What is clear is what South Africa are going to do,"" Joseph told reporters on Friday. ""It's not unique, but shows they are physically going to approach the match using their forwards and being very physical. ""(The) consistency of their game is around giving the opposition the ball and using their defence and big forwards to pressure (us)... and I guess that's what we've been preparing for all the way."" Erasmus and assistant coach Matt Proudfoot emphasised they would not be one-dimensional and South Africa do have a more attacking and balanced game than Ireland, who were beaten 19-12 by Japan in pool play. The former Springboks loose forward, however, picked a pack built to grind down the Japanese forwards and then loaded his bench with six forward replacements. Erasmus said that was to ensure that when they came on in the second half they would be fresh and able to close the gaps around the fringes, which Japan expertly exploited with clever running angles at pace against Scotland last Sunday. More importantly, Erasmus wanted his side to dictate the pace of the game to ensure that Japan's high tempo attack did not get into a rhythm. ""We will definitely try to play the game at our pace, and they will try to play the game at their pace,"" Erasmus said. ""That will be a tactical battle, and it's tough for me to say now who will be able to enforce that. ""But that will be a really big battle from the coaching staff, and the 15 players on the field."" While Karne Hesketh's try that sealed a 34-32 victory and the 'Brighton Miracle' four years ago has dominated the conversation in the lead-up, Joseph added that it had not factored into his side's preparations. ""I've been trying to forget about it for the last four years,"" Joseph said after he had made just one injury-enforced change to the side that sealed their quarter-final place with a 28-21 win over Scotland. ""Everyone talked about it (and) that was an amazing achievement at the last World Cup, (but) we're working on our own things and we won't be alluding to it.""

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N273148	"By Michael Taylor KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 18 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Swathes of rainforest Indonesia plans to recover from oil palm planters must not instead be handed to the mining and timber sectors nor used for infrastructure, green groups said. Jakarta last week said it could take back 1.4 million hectares (3.5 million acres) of forests under a ban on clearing land for palm plantations to produce the popular oil. Gemma Tillack, forest policy director at U.S.-based environmental group Rainforest Action Network, said the move was ""a welcome signal at a time when forest fires are destroying rainforests the world over"". ""(But) it is critical that lands spared from conversion to oil palm plantations are not reallocated for other destructive uses,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Friday. Home to the world's third-largest tropical forests, Indonesia is also the biggest producer of palm oil, which many green groups say has fuelled forest-clearing for plantations. Palm oil is the world's most widely used edible oil, found in everything from margarine to soap, but has faced scrutiny in recent years from green activists and consumers, who have blamed its production for forest loss, fires and worker exploitation. The slash-and-burn practices involved in palm oil production are often blamed for Indonesia's annual forest fires, which cause health-damaging air pollution across the region. Last year, President Joko Widodo issued a ban on new permits for palm plantations for three years, aiming to protect the Southeast Asian nation's forests and boost yields from existing planted areas. The order also gave the government the authority to review licenses, and revoke them if an area had yet to be cleared. Likely bureaucratic delays in taking back the land after last week's announcement could lead to pre-emptive deforestation by developers or undermine efforts by some firms to protect forests in their concessions, said Arie Rompas, a forest campaigner at Greenpeace Indonesia. Any forest or peatland areas returned to the government should be included in the country's permanent moratorium on new forest clearance, she added. Discussions about reclaimed land should involve local and indigenous people, environmental organisations, researchers and sustainable businesses, said Herry Purnomo, a scientist at the Center for International Forestry Research in Indonesia. Whether government ministries have the resources and funds to manage the additional forest areas was another concern, he noted, warning that illegal land-grabbing was a real danger. ""If the government transferred the expropriated lands back to the indigenous owners, there are good prospects that the forests could be conserved,"" said Marcus Colchester, a senior policy advisor at the Britain-based Forest Peoples Programme.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N2730VC	"By Rina Chandran PENANG, Malaysia, Oct 18 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Many of Asia's booming cities are failing to preserve their cultural heritage and risk losing the traditional knowledge that is crucial for promoting inclusiveness, sustainability and resilience, urban experts warned on Friday. This year, a majority of Asia-Pacific's population for the first time became urban, with more than half the population living in its rapidly expanding cities, according to a United Nations report published this week. But rising pressure on land for office blocks and metro rail networks has led to the razing of old buildings and informal settlements, and the loss of traditional skills, said Montira Horayangura Unakul at UNESCO, the U.N.'s cultural agency. ""In many cities, heritage is still viewed as a fringe issue, but it helps drive not just the development of crafts and tourism, but also broader economic, social and environmental development,"" she said. ""Heritage is not just about preserving a site, but also cultural practices, traditional knowledge, social values, economic principles - everything that is above and below the ground,"" she said at a U.N. urban conference in Penang. There are 193 cities and historic sites within urban areas among nearly 900 UNESCO world heritage sites. Safeguarding cultural heritage is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by U.N. member nations to tackle such issues as hunger, gender equality and climate change by 2030. It is also a part of the so-called New Urban Agenda, a 20-year roadmap for sustainable cities adopted in 2016. But informal settlements, which can also include urban villages in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia, are not regarded as heritage, said Elisa Sutanudjaja at the Rujak Center for Urban Studies, a Jakarta think tank. Dozens of Indonesian ""kampungs"", which are close-knit traditional villages, have been razed in Jakarta and their residents evicted or resettled, as authorities in the capital grapple with congestion, overcrowding and pollution. ""Cities are a combination of formality and informality, and the kampungs are a buffer zone that enables the transition from rural to urban life. They should be a part of urban planning,"" Sutanudjaja told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Residents, many of whom have lived there for generations, have valuable knowledge of disaster preparedness, flood mitigation and other risks linked to climate change, she said. ""Kampungs are living spaces with problems with sanitation and housing that reduce their resilience, so we also don't want to romanticise them. But demolition is not an answer,"" she said. There is also risk attached to success: George Town on Penang island, off Malaysia's west coast, is a UNESCO world heritage site that is hugely popular with tourists that many residents blame for congestion and higher rents. Under-pressure cities need a conservation approach when modernising, which includes residents to keeps alive traditional knowledge and cultures such as foods, clothing and music, said Saswat Bandyopadhyay, an urban planning professor at CEPT University in Ahmedabad, India. ""The loss of heritage is irreversible - once it's gone, it's gone. So we must be doing everything we can to preserve it."" (Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Michael Taylor.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N2732A9	"SEOUL, Oct 18 (Reuters) - South Korea's Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon is expected to meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe next Thursday in what would be the highest-level talks between the two countries since Tokyo imposed export curbs in a deepening trade and diplomatic spat, Seoul officials said on Friday. Lee is scheduled to visit Tokyo for Oct. 22-24 to attend Japanese Emperor Naruhito's enthronement ceremony on behalf of President Moon Jae-in. Both sides are trying to finalise a meeting between Lee and Abe on Oct. 24 following a banquet hosted by Abe the day before, Lee's office said in a statement. Relations between the neighbours are arguably at their lowest ebb since they normalised ties in 1965, after South Korea's Supreme Court last year ordered two Japanese companies to compensate some wartime labourers. Tensions flared between the two following the ruling. Lee said in an interview with Japan's Asahi newspaper released on Friday that he might deliver a letter from Moon expressing his willingness to work together to resolve disagreement over the forced labour issue. An official at Moon's office said he and Lee had discussed the idea, but a decision on it had not yet been taken. ""Our fundamental position is that politics and economic issues should be handled separately and we hope to foster forward-looking relations and resolve problems through dialogue,"" the official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the ties. Japan says the wartime labour issue was settled under the 1965 treaty that normalised ties. The dispute has since spilled over into trade and security, with Japan slapping export curbs and South Korea scrapping a bilateral intelligence-sharing pact.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N2726KY	"By Anastasia Moloney BOGOTA, Oct 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Mothers of young men and teenagers who say their sons were murdered by government soldiers during Colombia's conflict begged a tribunal for answers on Thursday as the country investigates human rights atrocities committed during its war. Colombia's five-decade war pitted leftist rebels against government forces and right-wing paramilitary groups. Some 200,000 people were killed, 7.7 million displaced and 60,000 listed as missing, according to government figures. A 2016 peace accord between the government and Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels established a Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) tribunal which is investigating war crimes. Its aims including uncovering what happened during Colombia's war and prosecuting FARC leaders and state military officials accused of human rights abuses. Wearing T-shirts with photos of their missing sons as handmade quilts and posters commemorating the dead lined the Bogota courtroom's walls, a dozen mothers and other relatives described their long quest for justice before three judges. ""I want to know the truth about what happened to my son, who did it and why. Who took him away?,"" said Beatriz Mendez, whose 19-year-old son and a nephew disappeared in 2004. ""I've been waiting for more than a decade for justice. There will be divine justice,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation as other mothers hugged and wiped away tears. The rights abuses are among the so-called ""false positives"" scandal that rocked Colombia in the late 2000s, when army units were found to have killed civilians and listed them as guerrillas killed in combat to inflate casualty numbers. Some officers accused of involvement have appeared before the JEP tribunal, while dozens of soldiers and officers have been convicted of crimes tied to the scandal since 2008 and are in prison. Dozens more have been fired. Colombia's attorney general's office is also investigating nearly 2,300 similar cases of alleged extra-judicial killings when victims, some as young as 16, were often lured from their homes in Bogota's slum neighborhoods by the promise of work. ""Our duty is to reach those who are the most responsible,"" judge Catalina Diaz told the hearing.  REDUCED JAILED SENTENCES The peace accord allows for former rebels and others who come forward to receive reduced sentences and avoid prison if they confess to crimes and repay victims, including any land and property seizures. Those admitting to war crimes will be sentenced to five to eight years of ""alternative punishment"". What that will mean in reality remains unclear, but options could include community service, restricted freedom or house arrest. Those who neither confess nor accept responsibility and are found guilty could face up to 20 years in jail. The peace accord has been criticized by some Colombians who demand tougher sanctions and jail for FARC rebels. But judge Ivan Gonzalez emphasized that the JEP is focused on ensuring victims learn the truth about what happened and receive reparations as outlined in the peace accord. ""The more truth and reparations there are, the less jail time there is,"" he said. Besides extra-judicial killings, judges are sifting through thousands of victim testimonies and investigating select cases as most representative of the atrocities, including kidnapping and the recruitment of children as fighters into FARC ranks. ""In the case of (child) recruitment we have 8,800 cases, so to investigate this really takes a long time,"" Gonzalez said. He said it is hoped the JEP can build a case on the use of sexual violence by FARC rebels, including forced abortions against women and girls in guerrilla ranks, and examine whether guerrillas used rape as a weapon of war.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N27268R	"By Stephanie Nebehay GENEVA, Oct 17 (Reuters) - African refugees in Libya are so desperate that some are bribing their way into detention centres in the hope of eventually being resettled out of the war-torn, lawless country, the United Nations said on Thursday. Forces loyal to eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar launched an offensive in April to try to wrest control of Tripoli from forces aligned with the internationally-recognised government, which is based in the capital. An air strike by opposition forces in July that killed more than 50 people at Tajoura detention centre in Tripoli increased pressure on countries to find a safe haven for trapped refugees and migrants. But despite continuing shelling and air attacks - fighting has killed more than 1,000 people and displaced 28,000 since April - few countries have agreed to take refugees out of Libya, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said. ""So far 14 states have pledged 6,611 places of resettlement...That's all,"" Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR special envoy for the central Mediterranean situation, told a briefing. Canada, Norway and Italy are among them, while Niger and Rwanda have offered others temporary sanctuary, he said. ""There are many countries that could offer places of resettlement and that do not,"" he added. Libya has become the main conduit for Africans fleeing war and poverty trying to reach Europe since former leader Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011, though the number of crossings dropped sharply from 2017 amid a European Union-backed push to block arrivals. Libya is host to 45,000 registered refugees and asylum-seekers, as well as an estimated 650,000 migrants, many of whom have found jobs there, Cochetel said. More than 5,000 refugees and migrants are held in 19 official detention facilities, some controlled by armed groups, as well as an unknown number in squalid centres run by traffickers, he said. Rights groups say abuses are rife including beating and forced labour. Detainees include those who left on boats for Europe and were brought back by the Libyan Coast Guard, Cochetel said, underlining it is not a safe country of asylum. ""And you have desperate individuals who go to detention centres, sometimes they pay to get inside detention centres. Sometimes they feel better protected in a detention centre than outside,"" Cochetel said. ""Because some nationalities outside detention centres are targeted by human traffickers, are kidnapped, and then you have extortion, you have torture. ""Some people don’t feel safe in many urban centres in Libya. So some of them prefer to be detained, even if conditions are not good in those detention centres.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N2722U8	"BEIRUT, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Qatar's government said on Thursday it adopted a new minimum wage law and will scrap mandatory exit visas for all workers, part of a broad labour reform program ahead of its hosting of the 2022 World Cup. The Gulf state, which relies on about 2 million migrant workers for the bulk of its labour force, is also planning to ease curbs on changing employers, Qatar's administrative development, labour and social affairs ministry said. Qatar, along with other wealthy Gulf Arab states, has come under fire for what rights groups describe as poor labour conditions. Doha is keen to show it is tackling allegations of worker exploitation as it prepares to host the 2022 soccer World Cup, which it hopes will boost its economy and development. The statement said the cabinet had adopted new legislation related to the draft law on a minimum wage, though it did not disclose what level the wage could be. It added it passed another draft law which will lead to the scrapping of exit permits for all workers, adding work was also underway to enable employees to change employers more easily. Qatar last year eliminated exit visas for some foreign migrant workers, but rights groups considered the reform incomplete as it did not apply to domestic workers and allowed companies to keep the visa requirement for up to 5% of staff. The International Labour Organization described the measures as ""a momentous step forward in upholding the rights of migrant workers"" and said they were aimed at ending the ""kafala"" (sponsorship system). This system is common in Gulf states where large portions of the population is foreign. In Qatar it requires workers to obtain their employers' consent before changing jobs, which advocate groups say leaves them open to abuse. ""These steps will greatly support the rights of migrant workers, while contributing to a more efficient and productive economy,"" the ILO said in a statement late on Wednesday. It said these new reforms were expected to come into force by January 2020. Many of the workers toiling on Qatar's building sites, sweeping its streets and cleaning private homes come from Asian countries like Nepal, India and the Philippines. Doha has responded to criticism by rights groups by enacting a broad reform program to guard worker rights and improve its image abroad.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26E4I6	"By Nanchanok Wongsamuth BANGKOK, Oct 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A Thai trafficker was sentenced to a record 374 years in jail for child trafficking in a ruling that lawyers say will send a deterrent to other criminals. Yuttana Kodsap, 31, was found guilty of child trafficking for the purpose of pornography after he lured children aged 7-12 to play computer games at his house where he filmed sexual acts with them and sold the videos on a chat app, police said. A court in Thailand's southern province of Phang Nga sentenced him to 374 years in jail for his crimes and ordered him to pay 800,000 Thai baht ($26,000) in compensation to each of the five victims, according to court documents provided to the Thomson Reuters Foundation by the Court of Justice. The case was the second trafficking case in Thailand in which offenders were sentenced to more than 300 years in jail. Last year the criminal court sentenced three men to up to 309 years each for trafficking children for prostitution. In both cases, courts capped the imprisonment period at 50 years in accordance with Thai law. Papop Siamhan, an independent lawyer with expertise in human trafficking, said child prostitution cases resulted in long prison sentences because they often involved several laws and many children. ""Long prison sentences will act as a deterrent because people will be afraid to commit such crimes, and it will also result in authorities and judges being more careful when handling such cases,"" he said. Earlier this year the United States praised Thailand for sentencing convicted traffickers and complicit officials to significant prison terms in its annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report. Thailand was ranked as a Tier 2 country in the report, meaning it is making significant efforts to combat the crime. Since January this year, courts have handed down 170 prison sentences in trafficking cases of which 74 were sentences of more than 10 years, according to the Court of Justice. Archana Kotecha, Asia region director and head of legal at anti-slavery charity Liberty Shared, said long sentences can be effective deterrents when they are addressed at kingpins in trafficking cases and not low level offenders. But she said this must be accompanied by seizure of assets which should be used to pay compensation to victims. ""Deterrence aimed at the freedom and assets of offenders is likely more effective and holistic as it takes into account the need to compensate victims for what they have endured and removes the commercial gain made by the offender,"" she said.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N2710TD	"By Michael Taylor KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A new green fund being set up by Indonesia should prioritise protecting its rainforests and creating a carbon trading programme to help the country meet its goals to curb climate change, environmentalists and officials said. Indonesia's environment ministry last week launched an agency to manage funds to repair environmental damage and educate communities to prevent further harm. The agency is due to begin operating at the start of 2020 with initial finance of about 2 trillion rupiah ($141 million) from land restoration payments and fines the state collects from environmental crime cases, as well as money from foreign donors. The agency could potentially raise up to 800 trillion rupiah ($56.5 billion) for environmental projects, Indonesia's finance minister told reporters. Vegard Kaale, Norway's ambassador to Indonesia, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the new fund could help Indonesia meet its national commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement to tackle climate change, ""if used efficiently"". ""The income from reduced deforestation could benefit provinces and communities that are both producing emissions reductions and preserving biodiversity and are most at risk of the impacts of climate change,"" he said, referring to compensation the Southeast Asian nation may receive for keeping its forests standing. Home to the world's third-largest tropical forests, Indonesia is also the biggest producer of palm oil, which many green groups blame for the clearing of forests for plantations. About a decade ago, Norway signed a $1-billion deal with Indonesia to protect its forests and this year made the first payment for cutting emissions after deforestation rates fell. Kaale said Indonesia could potentially increase its climate financing from many sources, including the private sector, international donors and multilateral organisations. ""Having a public, government-run fund established in Indonesia offers an opportunity to donors to more directly and efficiently support the policies of the government,"" he said. The fund could also strengthen coordination and boost action on green investment and climate change across Indonesia's government, as ten ministries are involved, he added.  MEETING PARIS PLEDGES Jakarta now aims to prepare regulation that will allow the country to launch a carbon trading programme. Under such schemes, entities wanting to reduce their planet-warming emissions buy credits from projects that keep greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere, such as protecting forests that store carbon. ""This should be one of the core businesses of the fund,"" said Daniel Murdiyarso and Michael Brady, scientists at the Center for International Forestry Research. ""A carbon trading programme is important for Indonesia to fulfil and receive performance-based payments for forest protection and to cover its nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement,"" they added. Like many Asian countries, Indonesia is experiencing a rise in urbanisation, population and economic growth and is scrambling to find ways to increase its electric power capacity, with coal plants set to play a major role. But under the Paris accord, Indonesia committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 29 percent by 2030, a target that could rise to 41 percent with international support. Annisa Rahmawati, a campaigner at Greenpeace Indonesia, said that without a dramatic reduction in the use of fossil fuels and an end to deforestation, the country would not be able to meet its Paris accord commitments and play its part in limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7F). ""Financing forest and peatland protection should therefore be a priority for the fund,"" she said. Ensuring the new fund and its investments are properly monitored and transparent will be vital to ensure the success of its projects and to attract finance, green groups said. Rahmawati said there was a danger the fund would prioritise projects whose main focus was to expand the economy, such as large dams and infrastructure in conservation areas, rather than tackling climate impacts and reducing emissions. ""Providing financing is one thing, but ensuring that the funded activities address the most relevant problems to prevent and mitigate climate change is essential,"" she said.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N2712UR	"By Rina Chandran PENANG, Malaysia, Oct 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - As Asian cities turn to technologies such as facial recognition and artificial intelligence to deliver social welfare and public services, urban experts on Thursday urged authorities to address privacy concerns and protect the vulnerable. From India to Indonesia, governments across the region are backing hundreds of Smart Cities that use technology and data to improve waste management and energy conservation, tackle traffic congestion and mitigate risks linked to climate change. ""Frontier technologies such as AI hold promise to reimagine how the public sector can better serve sustainable development needs,"" U.N. Under-Secretary-General Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana said at an urban conference in Penang. ""Fast-evolving technologies have the potential to transform the traditional way of doing things across all government functions and domains,"" she said, adding that public-private partnerships will be key. Worldwide, the rise of cloud-computing and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have led to data-gathering streetlights in China, autonomous buses in Singapore and facial recognition systems in Indian airports. AI, which includes machine-learning, autonomous and data processing systems, is currently being used in crime prevention, trademark applications and to improve crop yields, according to a U.N. study https://www.unescap.org/publications/artificial-intelligence-delivery-public-services released this week. But the increased use of data, and of systems such as facial recognition software and closed-circuit television have also sparked concerns over bias, security, privacy and surveillance. With systems of social assistance increasingly being driven by data and technologies, there is ""a grave risk of stumbling zombie-like into a digital welfare dystopia"", said Philip Alston, the U.N. special rapporteur on poverty and human rights. This is ""especially problematic when the private sector is taking a leading role in designing, constructing, and even operating significant parts of the digital welfare state"", Alston warned in a report last week. Technology companies operate in an almost ""human rights-free zone"", he added. Governments can guard against this by putting in adequate safeguards, and ensuring that there is good planning and governance, said Lim Teng Leng, deputy director at the Singaporean government's Centre for Liveable Cities. Technology-based solutions are no panacea for city problems, and can often cause just as many problems as they set out to address, he said. ""Smart Cities cannot be a measure of how advanced the technologies are, but how these technologies are used to solve problems,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""People have to believe that all this data will improve their lives, make their cities better and safer. The government must build trust by being upfront about what data they are collecting, what it is for, and admit when there are mistakes."" This is particularly relevant to poorer residents and those who are not tech-savvy and may be excluded, said Colin Fernandes at the Global Disaster Preparedness Center, a unit of the American Red Cross. ""Data collection often misses those in informal settlements, who are usually the most vulnerable to disasters and climate change risks, and most in need of welfare benefits and other assistance,"" he said. ""There is a failure to collect data, or a reluctance on their part to give up data, because they don't know whether the data will be used to evict them or protect them. They need to be assured of what they are signing up for."" (Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Michael Taylor.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N2721FE	"(Adds quotes) By Greg Stutchbury TOKYO, Oct 17 (Reuters) - South Africa's Cheslin Kolbe has returned from an ankle injury to be named in the starting side for Sunday's Rugby World Cup quarter-final against hosts Japan. Kolbe scored twice against Italy but picked up an injury and was kept out of the Springboks' final Pool B match against Canada as a precaution to ensure he was ready for the quarters. Coach Rassie Erasmus had rotated his squad through the pool stage to ensure his players all had game time before the knockout stage but has settled on the same matchday squad that played against Italy, with a 6-2 split between forwards and backs in the replacements. ""A lot of guys put up their hands and played really well and we wanted to get some continuity into the team,"" Erasmus told a media conference on Thursday. ""There were a few difficult selections but we felt given what we achieved against Italy and in the interests of combinations and continuity this was the best team to pick."" Erasmus said the 6-2 split on the bench was not an indication they would try to simply dominate the smaller Japanese forwards. ""The way Japan play is that they do exploit your tired and bigger forward defenders late in the first and second half so we think with our selection, two fresh forwards might nullify that space they want to use,"" Erasmus said. He added that the selection of Bongi Mbonambi as the starting hooker with Malcom Marx coming off the bench was due to the pace that they expected Japan to play. Mbonambi was better suited for a tighter role while Marx would be better ""when the game opened up"", Erasmus said. Captain Siya Kolisi will start his third match in succession, and play his fifth game at the tournament, after he returned from an injury-ravaged season in the Springboks' tournament opener against the All Blacks. ""We will probably try and play the game at our pace and they will try and play at theirs,"" Erasmus said. ""It will be a great tactical battle.

""Darknet sites that profit from the sexual exploitation of children are among the most vile and reprehensible forms of criminal behavior,"" U.S. Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski said. Officials have rescued at least 23 underage victims in the United States, Britain and Spain who were being actively abused by users of the site, the Justice Department said. Many children in the videos have not yet been identified. The site's vast library - nearly half of it consisting of images never seen before by law enforcement - is an illustration of what authorities say is an explosion of sexual abuse content online. In a statement, Britain's National Crime Agency said  officials were seeing ""increases in severity, scale and complexity.""         Welcome To Video's operator, a South Korean named Jong Woo Son, and 337 users in 12 different countries, have been charged so far, authorities said.  Son, currently serving an 18-month sentence in South Korea, was also indicted on federal charges in Washington.  Several other people charged in the case have already been convicted and are serving prison sentences of up to 15 years, according to the U.S. Justice Department.     Welcome To Video is one of the first websites to monetize child pornography using bitcoin, which allows users to hide their identities during financial transactions. Users were able to redeem the digital currency in return for ""points"" that they could spend downloading videos or buying all-you-can watch ""VIP"" accounts. Points could also be earned by uploading fresh child pornography.   'BOTTOM FEEDERS OF CRIMINAL WORLD' ""These are the bottom feeders of the criminal world,"" said Don Fort, chief of criminal investigation at the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which initiated the investigation. The Justice Department said the site collected at least $370,000 worth of bitcoin before it was taken down in March 2018 and that the currency was laundered through three unnamed digital currency exchanges.  Darknet websites are designed to be all-but-impossible to locate online. How authorities managed to locate and bring down the site isn't clear, with differing narratives by different law enforcement organizations on the matter. Fort said the investigation was triggered by a tip to the IRS from a confidential source. However, Britain's National Crime Agency said they came across the site during an investigation into a British academic who in October 2017 pleaded guilty https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-abuse-academic/uk-academic-who-blackmailed-victims-into-sending-horrific-abuse-photos-admits-137-offences-idUKKBN1CL2BA to blackmailing more than 50 people, including teenagers, into sending him depraved images that he shared online. In a statement, British authorities said the National Crime Agency's cybercrime unit deployed ""specialist capabilities"" to identify the server's location. The NCA did not immediately return an email seeking clarification on the term, which is sometimes used as a euphemism for hacking. The U.S. Justice Department gave a different explanation, saying that Welcome To Video's site was leaking its server's South Korean internet protocol address to the open internet. Experts pointed to the bust as evidence that the trade in child abuse imagery could be tackled without subverting the encryption that keeps the rest of the internet safe.  Officials in the United States and elsewhere have recently begun prodding major technology firms https://www.reuters.com/article/facebook-security/fbi-director-warns-facebook-could-become-platform-of-child-pornographers-idUSL2N26P0J7 to come up with solutions that could allow law enforcement to bypass the encryption that protects messaging apps like WhatsApp or iMessage, citing the fight against child pornography as a major reason. Welcome To Video's demise ""is a clear indication that in cases like this, where there's very low-hanging fruit, breaking encryption is not required,"" said Christopher Parsons, a senior research associate at Citizen Lab, based at the University of Toronto's Munk School.  He said the bust showed that law enforcement could also track criminal activity that employs cryptocurrency transactions. ""There's a lot of a people who have this perception that bitcoin is totally anonymous,"" Parsons said, ""and it's been the downfall of many people in many investigations.""

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_KBN1WV1CM	"By Alexandra Alper and Tuvan Gumrukcu WASHINGTON/ANKARA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he did not mind Russia helping Syria in a conflict with NATO ally Turkey and rejected criticism of his withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria that exposed Kurdish allies, calling it ""strategically brilliant."" In a day of fast-moving events, Trump endured harsh criticism for the withdrawal and lashed out at U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, calling her a ""third-rate"" politician during a tense White House meeting after which she accused him of having a ""meltdown."" Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. forces before a Turkish  offensive into northern Syria last week has shattered the relative calm there and he has been accused of abandoning Kurdish militia who helped the United States fight Islamic State militants in the region. The hasty troop exit has created a land rush between Turkey and Russia - now the undisputed foreign powers in the area - to partition the formerly U.S.-protected Kurdish area. It has allowed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to redeploy his forces to an area that had been beyond his control for years in the more than eight-year Syrian war. Syrian troops accompanied by Russian forces entered the city of Kobani, a strategically important border city and a potential flashpoint for a wider conflict, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the Syrian war, reported. Speaking to reporters as he met Italian President Sergio Mattarella and then at a joint news conference, Trump said the Kurds were ""not angels"" and that it might be necessary for Russian-backed Syria and Turkey to ""fight it out.""  FIGHT FOR LAND ""Our soldiers are not in harm's way - as they shouldn't be, as two countries fight over land that has nothing to do with us,"" Trump said during Oval Office talks with Mattarella where he sounded as if he were washing his hands of the conflict. He also defended his move to get U.S. troops out as part of his wider effort to bring Americans home from ""endless wars,"" despite being excoriated by members of his own Republican Party. U.S officials say, however, that those troops were expected to be repositioned in the region. Some of them could go to Iraq. ""I viewed the situation on the Turkish border with Syria to be for the United States strategically brilliant,"" Trump said. ""Syria may have some help with Russia, and that's fine. It's a lot of sand,"" he later said. ""So you have Syria and you have Turkey. They're going to argue it out, maybe they're going to fight it out. But our men aren't going to get killed over it."" Acting last week after a phone call on Oct. 6 with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, Trump abruptly upended five years of U.S. policy with his decision to withhold protection from Syria's Kurds and to withdraw first about 50 special operations forces and then the roughly 1,000 U.S. troops in northern Syria. ""This is a mistake worse than what (Barack) Obama did"" when the former president withdrew U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, Republican U.S. Senator Lindsay Graham, usually among Trump's strongest supporters, told reporters. The White House, fighting the domestic political damage and perhaps trying to demonstrate the president's efforts to stop Turkey's onslaught, released an Oct. 9 Trump letter to Erdogan that said: ""Don't be a tough guy"" and ""Don't be a fool!""  SANCTIONS Washington announced sanctions on Monday to punish Turkey, but Trump's critics said the steps, mainly a steel tariffs hike and a pause in trade talks, were too feeble to have an impact. On Wednesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said sanctions included the entire ministries of energy and defence and could be broadened to others. Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives also plan to introduce sanctions legislation. Trump dispatched some of his top aides, including Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Turkey for emergency talks to try to persuade Ankara to halt its assault. Trump said he thought Pence and Erdogan would have a ""successful meeting"" with Erdogan, saying if they did not, U.S. sanctions and tariffs ""will be devastating to Turkey's economy."" Erdogan's spokesman said Turkey's Foreign Ministry was preparing retaliation for U.S. sanctions. A White House meeting between Trump, Republican and Democratic lawmakers on U.S. policy in Syria was cut short. Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, said Trump was upset by a 354-60 House vote condemning his Syria withdrawal. Republicans said Pelosi ""stormed out."" ""What we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown. Sad to say,"" Pelosi, whose fellow Democrats are investigating whether to impeach Trump because of his actions towards Ukraine, said upon leaving. Trump shot back via Twitter on Wednesday night, posting - ""Nervous Nancy's unhinged meltdown!"" with a photo of Pelosi standing up and pointing at him during the meeting. Dozens of Republicans joined the majority Democrats in the House vote. The split underscored deep unhappiness in Congress over Trump's action, which many lawmakers view as abandoning Kurdish fighters who had been loyally fighting alongside Americans to defeat Islamic State. Trump has denied giving a green light to Turkey to attack the Syrian Kurds. Erdogan has insisted there will be no ceasefire, and said he might call off a visit to the United States in November because of the ""very big disrespect"" shown by U.S. politicians.  He also denounced Washington for taking the ""unlawful, ugly step"" of imposing criminal charges against a Turkish state bank Halkbank over allegations it broke sanctions on Iran. Washington says the case is unrelated to politics. Halkbank denies wrongdoing. Turkey's assault has spawned a humanitarian crisis, with 160,000 civilians taking flight, a security alert over thousands of Islamic State fighters abandoned in Kurdish jails, and a political maelstrom at home for Trump. Senior Republicans voiced dismay. ""I'm sorry that we are where we are,"" the characteristically understated Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, telling reporters he hoped Pence and Pompeo ""can somehow repair the damage"" during their trip to Ankara. Syrian army forces, backed by Washington's adversaries Russia and Iran, have exploited the power vacuum left by U.S. troops to advance.  Turkey's cross-border offensive and the U.S. pullout have brought the two biggest militaries in NATO close to confrontation on the battlefield. The United States has complained about Turkish artillery fire near its troops. The Syrian Observatory said Russian troops had crossed the Euphrates River to advance to Kobani's outskirts. Lebanon's al-Mayadeen TV reported that Russian-backed Syrian forces had also set up outposts in Raqqa, the one-time capital of Islamic State's caliphate, which the Kurds captured in 2017 at the peak of their campaign with U.S. support. Trump did not object to an agreement cut between Kurdish-led forces and the Syrian government to protect Syria from a Turkish offensive, said Commander Mazloum Kobani of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), of which the Kurdish YPG is the main fighting element.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L8N23D37B	"By Rina Chandran HONG KONG, Oct 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When authorities drew up a plan to make Hong Kong a hub for Asia's wine trade, they faced a big challenge: where to store the bottles in a city that was fast running out of space. So they went underground. Officials presented World War Two-era bunkers as potential sites, and former diplomat Gregory De'eb and businessman Jim Thompson signed a lease on them, setting up Hong Kong's first commercial wine cellar 20 metres (66 ft) below ground in 2003. Crown Wine Cellars can store more than 100,000 bottles, and also has a subterranean clubhouse. ""It is the underground aspect of the club that is its most attractive and popular feature,"" said De'eb. ""Members even view the lack of mobile phone reception as overwhelmingly positive."" Hong Kong plans to move more facilities beneath the Earth's surface to free up space above, in one of the world's priciest real-estate markets. With almost 70% of the global population expected to be living in urban areas by 2050, according to the United Nations, cities are coming under the spotlight as never before. From Singapore to sub-Saharan Africa, they are fast running out of space to house their swelling populations. Cities have long put metro rail networks, as well as utilities like sewage and water pipes underground, with several also moving commercial, retail and storage facilities down below to free up space or better handle extreme temperatures. In Hong Kong, known for its towering skyscrapers and wooded hills, sky-high home prices have boosted the urgency of maximising use of underground space. The government has vowed to create more land for housing, including by building artificial islands. It is also looking to use underground space for waste treatment, data centres, water reservoirs, power stations, crematoriums and sports facilities. The city's rocky terrain lends itself to cavern development as a ""cost-effective alternative"" for long-term land supply that offers safety, environmental and security benefits, said Edward Lo, Hong Kong's chief town planner. ""Given the lack of land resources in Hong Kong, it has all along been our policy objective to develop underground space,"" he added.  'BAD' NEIGHBOURS From the catacombs of ancient Rome to step wells in medieval India and army bunkers, underground spaces have been used for a variety of reasons down the ages. Helsinki and Montreal, which are blanketed in snow for several months of the year, are considered leaders in ""underground urbanism"", a movement focused on innovative ways to use underground space. Besides mass transit, growing concerns around the environmental and health impacts of ""bad neighbour"" facilities such as refuse transfer and waste treatment plants have pushed cities to consider moving those below ground as well. Underground space is ideal for a densely populated city like Hong Kong, which has more than 7 million people crammed into an area of about 1,100 square kilometres (425 square miles), with less than a quarter of that land available for development. About a decade ago, authorities unveiled a policy aimed at studying the opportunities in underground space. In a government-commissioned study, consultancy Arup identified 48 potential underground and hillside sites for new caverns, and some 400 state facilities that could be moved underground. ""The idea was to better integrate facilities, so people can easily move between them, and avoid the conflicts of traffic and weather disruptions above ground,"" said Mark Wallace, director of infrastructure at consultancy Arup. ""For the city, it results in more efficient use of space, reduces the impacts of urban sprawl, and helps preserve the natural environment,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. While excavation and building underground are more expensive, there are savings on maintenance and land costs, he added. And less energy is needed because of more stable temperatures underground, an important factor for cities looking to curb their carbon emissions. Underground structures also perform better in earthquakes and need fewer repairs, while offering better protection from typhoons and thunderstorms, which are forecast to become more severe as global temperatures rise. Cheaper, fast-digging technologies such as those used by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk to build a high-speed transport tunnel in Los Angeles, meanwhile, can cut construction time and minimise disruption above ground. ""As older urban areas in Hong Kong deteriorate and new infrastructure or redevelopment is needed, underground development is a way to build new facilities with minimum disruption to the surface and public,"" Wallace said.  ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS Elsewhere in Asia, space constraints and security concerns prompted the development of underground space decades ago in Japan and South Korea. More than 20 Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen are now making plans for urban underground space, while Singapore unveiled an underground master-plan this year. Hong Kong, like Singapore, has traditionally relied on reclaimed land, but that is seen as increasingly unsustainable because it fuels environmentally harmful processes like sand mining, said Mee Kam Ng, director of the urban studies programme at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Digging out space underground can also have effects on groundwater and surface ecology, she said. Instead, Hong Kong could free up nearly 4,000 hectares through better planning for its existing land resources such as the largely rural New Territories in the north, she said, citing research by the Citizens Task Force, a non-profit network. Some residents are resistant to the idea of tearing up parks to create shopping malls underground. An ongoing study of potential underground development in Tsim Sha Tsui has drawn criticism from planners and locals, who say any benefits will be outweighed by the damage to Kowloon Park, a green oasis in the congested city. The plan proposes that underground spaces be built beneath about a quarter of the 13-hectare park for retail and community facilities, parking and pedestrian passages. Areas of the park could be affected for up to seven years during construction, while parts of it will be surrendered for access points, opponents say. Authorities say the development will improve pedestrian movement and reduce congestion, and that ""old and valuable trees"" will be preserved. But Paul Zimmerman, chief executive of Designing Hong Kong, an urban think-tank, said the project would wreck the park, while failing to ease traffic significantly. ""Good use of underground space is definitely needed in Hong Kong, and it makes sense in some cases - like roads and sewage treatment, and wine cellars,"" he said. ""But it does not make sense in others, like building a multi-storey complex under a park that will destroy the park's character and only creates more shops and parking.""

Officials from the United States, Britain and South Korea described the network as one of the largest child pornography operations they had encountered to date. Called Welcome To Video, the website relied on the bitcoin cryptocurrency to sell access to 250,000 videos depicting child sexual abuse, authorities said, including footage of extremely young children being raped. Its upload page specifically stated, ""Do not upload adult porn."" ""Darknet sites that profit from the sexual exploitation of children are among the most vile and reprehensible forms of criminal behaviour,"" U.S. Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski said. Officials have rescued at least 23 underage victims in the United States, Britain and Spain who were being actively abused by users of the site, the Justice Department said. Many children in the videos have not yet been identified. The site's vast library - nearly half of it consisting of images never seen before by law enforcement - is an illustration of what authorities say is an explosion of sexual abuse content online. In a statement, Britain's National Crime Agency said  officials were seeing ""increases in severity, scale and complexity.""         Welcome To Video's operator, a South Korean named Jong Woo Son, and 337 users in 12 different countries, have been charged so far, authorities said.  Son, currently serving an 18-month sentence in South Korea, was also indicted on federal charges in Washington.  Several other people charged in the case have already been convicted and are serving prison sentences of up to 15 years, according to the U.S. Justice Department.     Welcome To Video is one of the first websites to monetize child pornography using bitcoin, which allows users to hide their identities during financial transactions. Users were able to redeem the digital currency in return for ""points"" that they could spend downloading videos or buying all-you-can watch ""VIP"" accounts. Points could also be earned by uploading fresh child pornography.   'BOTTOM FEEDERS OF CRIMINAL WORLD' ""These are the bottom feeders of the criminal world,"" said Don Fort, chief of criminal investigation at the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which initiated the investigation. The Justice Department said the site collected at least $370,000 worth of bitcoin before it was taken down in March 2018 and that the currency was laundered through three unnamed digital currency exchanges.  Darknet websites are designed to be all-but-impossible to locate online. How authorities managed to locate and bring down the site isn't clear, with differing narratives by different law enforcement organizations on the matter. Fort said the investigation was triggered by a tip to the IRS from a confidential source. However, Britain's National Crime Agency said they came across the site during an investigation into a British academic who in October 2017 pleaded guilty https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-abuse-academic/uk-academic-who-blackmailed-victims-into-sending-horrific-abuse-photos-admits-137-offences-idUKKBN1CL2BA to blackmailing more than 50 people, including teenagers, into sending him depraved images that he shared online. In a statement, British authorities said the National Crime Agency's cybercrime unit deployed ""specialist capabilities"" to identify the server's location. The NCA did not immediately return an email seeking clarification on the term, which is sometimes used as a euphemism for hacking. The U.S. Justice Department gave a different explanation, saying that Welcome To Video's site was leaking its server's South Korean internet protocol address to the open internet. Experts pointed to the bust as evidence that the trade in child abuse imagery could be tackled without subverting the encryption that keeps the rest of the internet safe.  Officials in the United States and elsewhere have recently begun prodding major technology firms https://www.reuters.com/article/facebook-security/fbi-director-warns-facebook-could-become-platform-of-child-pornographers-idUSL2N26P0J7 to come up with solutions that could allow law enforcement to bypass the encryption that protects messaging apps like WhatsApp or iMessage, citing the fight against child pornography as a major reason.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_XXN271002	"By Thin Lei Win ROME, Oct 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Keeping girls in schools in Africa is key to lowering the fast-growing continent's high fertility rates and ultimately ending hunger and poverty, U.S. economist Jeffrey Sachs said Wednesday. Failure to do would bring more misery and suffering to the region, he warned, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa where nearly one in four people already go hungry. Africa currently has the world's highest rates of fertility, with 4.6 births per woman compared to the global average of 2.9, according to a United Nations report released in June. Girls leaving school early and entering motherhood is the ""overwhelming reason"" for this, Sachs told representatives of world leaders in a World Food Day lecture at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). ""Educate girls, fertility rates come down, women enter the labour force. That's true across every country, every religion,"" said Sachs, who advised governments and the United Nations on the latest global goals agreed in 2015 to tackle these issues. U.N. figures show that 130 million girls of school age globally are not in school, and the world's highest rate of teenage pregnancy — 143 per 1,000 girls aged 15–19 years — is in sub-Saharan Africa. Current projections show the population of Africa could more than triple to 4.3 billion by 2100 from about 1.3 billion today. ""If Africa stays on this demographic trajectory, it's impossible to end hunger and it is impossible to end poverty,"" said Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University in New York. ""Not only will those numbers run far ahead of any infrastructure imaginable and any public services imaginable, but the pressures on the physical land would be impossible, especially in an era of climate change."" He urged developed nations and donors to ensure all children across the globe completed secondary school. Sachs said climate change and conflicts - which experts say are the main drivers of global hunger which has been rising for three years in a row - are ""utterly within our control"". ""We need to end the use of coal, oil and gas and move to wind, hydrogen, solar, geothermal and other zero-carbon energy sources and to complete that transformation by mid-century,"" he said. In Africa, for example, replacing wood stoves with renewables could be done within 10 years, he said. ""It's a matter of placing the solar panels. And Africa is blessed with wonderful solar energy. It could power the whole continent,"" said Sachs. ""There is no problem that we face for which solutions have not been identified ... but we have been under-investing in these solutions.""

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_KBN1WV1DY	"By Delphine Schrank MATAMOROS, Mexico (Reuters) - Even after he was kidnapped and robbed outside the makeshift migrant camp where he had slept for two weeks, Luis Osorto decided his only chance for eventual asylum in the United States was to stay put along the border just inside Mexico. But the 37-year-old Honduran made a pact with himself: not to leave the enclave of tents at the end of a bridge between Matamoros and Brownsville, Texas - not even to buy a bottle of water or to collect money transfers from his family back home. The cramped camp, in a partly fenced-in plaza abutting administrative buildings just feet from the Rio Grande, is home to approximately 1,000 migrants, many of them sent back to Mexico to await U.S. immigration hearings under a policy called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) begun this year.  After what is commonly known as an ""express kidnapping"" last month by men waiting in a van for him outside a convenience store where he was collecting a $100 transfer from relatives, Osorto promised himself he would only leave the camp to cross the bridge to Texas for his December court date with U.S. immigration authorities. ""I just wait here and trust someone else ... to get me 70 pesos ($3.50) or so when I need it,"" he said. MPP, sometimes called Remain in Mexico, is among various overlapping U.S. policies aimed at severely reducing asylum claims. President Donald Trump, whose hardline stance on immigration was a mainstay of his 2016 campaign, has said lax U.S. asylum laws encourage people to show up at the border with their children. Before MPP, it was common practice to release arriving families into the United States to wait out their U.S. court hearings – something Trump and others said allowed many migrants to disappear into the country to live illegally. Studies by legal aid groups, such as the Urban Justice Center, have shown that most asylum seekers show up for their hearings, however. More than 51,000 people, mainly from Central America, have been sent to Mexico since the MPP program started in January, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. But reports of kidnapping and extortion have increased since the program was expanded to Matamoros and nearby Nuevo Laredo in crime-wracked Tamaulipas state.  Human Rights First, a U.S.-based rights group, in August documented 110 publicly reported cases of rape, kidnapping, sexual exploitation and other violence against MPP returnees. In Matamoros, violence and abuse targeting migrants means many in the MPP program refuse to move to a shelter in the city during their long waits for a U.S. court hearing. Since July, Matamoros has received more than 12,000 asylum seekers under MPP, said Enrique Maciel, of the Tamaulipas Institute for Migrants, a state agency.  Matamoros Mayor Mario Lopez described the city as calmer than neighboring towns, because of a truce between two rival drug cartels. Elsewhere in the state, gangs regularly fight pitched battles for turf.  Reuters spoke to six asylum seekers at Osorto's camp who said they had been kidnapped or extorted, and several more who had brushes with suspected criminals near the border or elsewhere within Mexico. Oscar Ramirez, a 30-year-old Honduran waiting for a U.S. court date on Dec. 2, said three Mexican men surrounded him around midnight last month, and began interrogating him on his plans and his paperwork, he said. ""I was terrified,"" said Ramirez, who said he ran away from the men when a crowd of people arrived. ""The rumors circulating are that at any moment unknown people will kidnap you.""   Reuters was unable to independently corroborate the migrants' stories. Osorto said he did not report the attack on him to police. Kristin Clarens, a U.S. attorney who advises asylum-seekers at the border, said she had come across five cases of migrants in Matamoros awaiting MPP hearings who were kidnapped briefly. They were taken to an ATM to clear out their accounts or forced to phone relatives to send cash transfers to a nearby convenience store. A spokesman for Mexico's National Institute for Migration said it had no data on such complaints. Mexico's national rights ombudsman said it was checking for data. The Tamaulipas state Attorney General's Office and the federal Attorney General's Office declined to comment. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment about the dangers in Tamaulipas.  TOO AFRAID TO GO TO SHELTER In Osorto's camp, asylum seekers use water from the Rio Grande to wash, despite outbreaks of rashes. Women pay a small fee to use a nearby toilet. For food, tents, and the occasional yoga mat to lie on they depend on volunteers from across the border.  At night, couples take turns keeping watch over their children, fearful criminals will snatch them if they both sleep.  Early last month, a Honduran mother and daughter seeking asylum drowned in the river near the camp, in what the Honduran foreign ministry said was an act of desperation after three month's wait in Mexico. Glady Canas, director of Matamoros-based migrant-aid nonprofit Helping Them to Triumph, said she has tried in vain to convince families to move into the city's lone migrant shelter and its neat dormitories.   ""ATTACKING OUR MINDS""  A U.S. Supreme Court decision last month allowed the Trump administration to reject asylum for anyone who passed through a third country, such as Mexico, and did not apply for asylum there. Trump had earlier threatened to impose tariffs on Mexico unless it stopped more migrants, and the U.S. neighbor has since used its military police to contain migration northward. Clarens, the U.S. attorney, said Trump's policies were effectively blocking most routes to asylum.     ""It's like a complicated chess game and this is like checkmate,"" she said. In the Matamoros camp, asylum-seekers fret on a shared What's App group, or aloud, while trying to discern U.S. policy means for them. ""They are attacking our minds,"" 27-year-old Oscar Borjas, said of shifting U.S. policy, shuffling a deck of cards late one night in an alleyway between tents.  Osorto, who fled violence in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, said fear and a feeling of being powerless were inescapable. ""We don't go downtown because they say it's more dangerous,"" he said. But wincing as he glanced out over the tents, he added: ""There's nothing to do here.""

The rape in May of a three-year-old girl at a private nursery in Myanmar has sparked outrage, prompting thousands to take to the streets to demand justice and highlighting a paucity of sex education in the country. It came as the overall number of rape cases in Myanmar surged from 1,100 cases in 2016 to more than 1,500 in 2018, nearly two-thirds involving a child, according to local media quoting government data. ""The case was obvious evidence that we are lacking sex education,"" said Hla Hla Win, a former English teacher who founded Myanmar-based 360ed, a social enterprise that seeks to revamp education with technology. ""It broke the hearts of so many parents but it was also a wake-up call that we can no longer see sex education as a taboo,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Myanmar's biggest city Yangon on Wednesday. The 38-year-old Harvard graduate was named one of 40 social entrepreneurs of the year by the World Economic Forum in New York last month for her work in transforming the way hundreds of thousands of students learn in Myanmar. Key to her work is augmented reality (AR): ever more popular globally in everything from arts to flight training. Under AR, digital images are superimposed on reality to create a rich, interactive experience that combines real and virtual worlds. In Myanmar, 360ed uses AR in a series of apps it has developed since 2016 to help students better visualise complex subjects such as chemistry and biology. Her project on sex education, named ""Bay Kin"" or ""Danger Free"", was launched in August soon after the child-rape case ignited national debate about sex, safety, children and consent. The product includes a series of sex education books - in both paper and AR formats - as well as comics and games, that teach students about everything from sex organs to pregnancy. ""As a mother and a teacher, I'm keen on this topic because many teenagers are curious about it but we don't have a tool to teach them,"" said Hla Hla Win, who has a four-year-old daughter. ""A lot of teenagers in Myanmar thought pregnancy could just happen from sharing a same glass of water with the opposite sex,"" she added. So far about 100 schools have partnered with 360ed to use its sex education books; now it is working with teachers to roll out the AR technology. ""We're in the early stage because many teachers still feel embarrassed to teach sex in schools but AR is fun, so we hope it can help to overcome this,"" said Hla Hla Win. The three-year-old girl, nicknamed Victoria, testified via video link at a trial last month after a school employee was charged with raping her. The case has been a lightning rod for popular protest in Myanmar, be it over the many nurseries that lack licences or the hasty way police handled investigations. Child rapists face a maximum life imprisonment if convicted. (Reporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi; Editing by Lyndsay Griffiths.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N2712H4	"By Zeba Siddiqui and Suchitra Mohanty NEW DELHI, Oct 16 (Reuters) - India's Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered an end to hearings in a long-running dispute between Hindus and Muslims over a place of worship, laying the ground for a verdict that could lead to further divisions. Hindus believe that the site in the northern town of Ayodhya is the birthplace of god-king Lord Ram and want a temple built on the ruins of a mosque that was torn down by zealots in 1992, triggering riots across the country. Muslims want the 16th century mosque be rebuilt and leaders from the two sides have been arguing over the matter for decades. ""Enough is enough,"" Supreme Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said in a packed courtroom in New Delhi, sitting alongside four other judges. ""Hearing in this matter is going to be completed today,"" he said. Hindu groups tied to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party have been agitating for a temple at the site, saying a temple existed there before Muslim invaders destroyed it and built the mosque. Lawyers, journalists and a couple of saffron-robed Hindu monks jostled for space in the courtroom as both sides made their case over who the land should be given to, quoting historical information. ""The mosque was a symbol of slavery as it was built by a Mughal invader Babar by demolishing a holy temple,"" said Sharad Sharma, spokesman of the Vishva Hindu Parishad, a Hindu nationalist organisation. He said he was confident of a verdict in favour of the Hindus. Gogoi is expected to announce a verdict next month. Ahead of the court decision, local authorities banned gatherings of more than four people across Ayodhya town to prevent a trouble between majority Hindus and Muslims who make up 12 percent of the population. Thousands of people have died in riots that have erupted over Ayodhya over the years. ""We have made our submissions, now whatever happens is in the hands of the almighty,"" Zafaryb Jilani, a lawyer representing the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, said.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L2N269111	"By Delphine Schrank MATAMOROS, Mexico, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Even after he was kidnapped and robbed outside the makeshift migrant camp where he had slept for two weeks, Luis Osorto decided his only chance for eventual asylum in the United States was to stay put along the border just inside Mexico. But the 37-year-old Honduran made a pact with himself: not to leave the enclave of tents at the end of a bridge between Matamoros and Brownsville, Texas - not even to buy a bottle of water or to collect money transfers from his family back home. The cramped camp, in a partly fenced-in plaza abutting administrative buildings just feet from the Rio Grande, is home to approximately 1,000 migrants, many of them sent back to Mexico to await U.S. immigration hearings under a policy called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) begun this year. After what is commonly known as an ""express kidnapping"" last month by men waiting in a van for him outside a convenience store where he was collecting a $100 transfer from relatives, Osorto promised himself he would only leave the camp to cross the bridge to Texas for his December court date with U.S. immigration authorities. ""I just wait here and trust someone else ... to get me 70 pesos ($3.50) or so when I need it,"" he said. MPP, sometimes called Remain in Mexico, is among various overlapping U.S. policies aimed at severely reducing asylum claims. President Donald Trump, whose hardline stance on immigration was a mainstay of his 2016 campaign, has said lax U.S. asylum laws encourage people to show up at the border with their children. Before MPP, it was common practice to release arriving families into the United States to wait out their U.S. court hearings – something Trump and others said allowed many migrants to disappear into the country to live illegally. Studies by legal aid groups, such as the Urban Justice Center, have shown that most asylum seekers show up for their hearings, however. More than 51,000 people, mainly from Central America, have been sent to Mexico since the MPP program started in January, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. But reports of kidnapping and extortion have increased since the program was expanded to Matamoros and nearby Nuevo Laredo in crime-wracked Tamaulipas state. Human Rights First, a U.S.-based rights group, in August documented 110 publicly reported cases of rape, kidnapping, sexual exploitation and other violence against MPP returnees. In Matamoros, violence and abuse targeting migrants means many in the MPP program refuse to move to a shelter in the city during their long waits for a U.S. court hearing. Since July, Matamoros has received more than 12,000 asylum seekers under MPP, said Enrique Maciel, of the Tamaulipas Institute for Migrants, a state agency. Matamoros Mayor Mario Lopez described the city as calmer than neighboring towns, because of a truce between two rival drug cartels. Elsewhere in the state, gangs regularly fight pitched battles for turf. Reuters spoke to six asylum seekers at Osorto's camp who said they had been kidnapped or extorted, and several more who had brushes with suspected criminals near the border or elsewhere within Mexico. Oscar Ramirez, a 30-year-old Honduran waiting for a U.S. court date on Dec. 2, said three Mexican men surrounded him around midnight last month, and began interrogating him on his plans and his paperwork, he said. ""I was terrified,"" said Ramirez, who said he ran away from the men when a crowd of people arrived. ""The rumors circulating are that at any moment unknown people will kidnap you."" Reuters was unable to independently corroborate the migrants' stories. Osorto said he did not report the attack on him to police. Kristin Clarens, a U.S. attorney who advises asylum-seekers at the border, said she had come across five cases of migrants in Matamoros awaiting MPP hearings who were kidnapped briefly. They were taken to an ATM to clear out their accounts or forced to phone relatives to send cash transfers to a nearby convenience store. A spokesman for Mexico's National Institute for Migration said it had no data on such complaints. Mexico's national rights ombudsman said it was checking for data. The Tamaulipas state Attorney General's Office and the federal Attorney General's Office declined to comment. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment about the dangers in Tamaulipas.  TOO AFRAID TO GO TO SHELTER In Osorto's camp, asylum seekers use water from the Rio Grande to wash, despite outbreaks of rashes. Women pay a small fee to use a nearby toilet. For food, tents, and the occasional yoga mat to lie on they depend on volunteers from across the border. At night, couples take turns keeping watch over their children, fearful criminals will snatch them if they both sleep. Early last month, a Honduran mother and daughter seeking asylum drowned in the river near the camp, in what the Honduran foreign ministry said was an act of desperation after three month's wait in Mexico. Glady Canas, director of Matamoros-based migrant-aid nonprofit Helping Them to Triumph, said she has tried in vain to convince families to move into the city's lone migrant shelter and its neat dormitories.  ""ATTACKING OUR MINDS"" A U.S. Supreme Court decision last month allowed the Trump administration to reject asylum for anyone who passed through a third country, such as Mexico, and did not apply for asylum there. Trump had earlier threatened to impose tariffs on Mexico unless it stopped more migrants, and the U.S. neighbor has since used its military police to contain migration northward. Clarens, the U.S. attorney, said Trump's policies were effectively blocking most routes to asylum. ""It's like a complicated chess game and this is like checkmate,"" she said. In the Matamoros camp, asylum-seekers fret on a shared What's App group, or aloud, while trying to discern U.S. policy means for them. ""They are attacking our minds,"" 27-year-old Oscar Borjas, said of shifting U.S. policy, shuffling a deck of cards late one night in an alleyway between tents. Osorto, who fled violence in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, said fear and a feeling of being powerless were inescapable. ""We don't go downtown because they say it's more dangerous,"" he said. But wincing as he glanced out over the tents, he added: ""There's nothing to do here.""

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L8N2583XX	"By Kim Harrisberg and Anastasia Moloney JOHANNESBURG/ MEDELLIN, Oct 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - M othibi Pheko's gun rested across his bullet-proof vest as he patrolled a lush Johannesburg suburb backed by an array of high-tech tools to combat South Africa's notoriously violent thieves. As he pulled over to check on residents, staff in the nearby control room monitored surveillance camera feeds from around the properties. ""We are proactive when it comes to crime prevention, not only reactive,"" said Pheko, who works with local security firm 7Arrows, pointing out several closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras on different corners of the Sandown gated community. ""Every person has a right to be safe."" A growing number of cities worldwide are using advanced CCTV systems and forensic tools like DNA databases to tackle crime, raising concerns that privacy is being lost while criminals are merely being pushed to poorer areas with less surveillance. Security experts say state-of-the-art gadgets are no substitute for efforts to address underlying causes of crime, such as high unemployment and inequality, or to reform corrupt and overburdened law enforcement agencies. To speed up its response, 7Arrows buys live footage from 1,500 CCTV cameras around Johannesburg - set to increase to 15,000 by February - that can read licence plates in high definition and use thermal detectors for poor visibility. ""Vumacam's vetted clients who have access to view our feed can choose to overlay a number of software options that will help generate alerts,"" said Ricky Croock, chief executive officer of Vumacam which is rolling out the cameras. ""Analytic software filters out 95% of footage and only unusual behaviour is sent to clients who then decide whether to dispense a security vehicle.""  FALSE SECURITY South Africa has one the world's biggest private security industries, with more than 9,000 registered companies and 450,000 active guards, according to the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority - far outstripping police numbers. Barbed wire, electric fences and panic buttons are a part of everyday life in a country with more than 20,000 murders a year - the world's fifth highest murder rate in 2019, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Senior officials have compared parts of South Africa to a war zone. The army was deployed to seal off part of Cape Town in July to rein in a spate of gang-related killings. ""South Africans absolutely normalise what is crazy for anyone else,"" said Mandy Pienaar, a Johannesburg media executive who three years ago was hijacked in her car and robbed at gunpoint. ""We do have a very false sense of security living behind our walls, with our alarms and our big guard dogs."" Tech innovations like Vumacam's CCTV roll out have attracted criticism from civil rights groups in South Africa who say they risk worsening the divide between rich and poor - in what is already the world's most unequal country by income, according to the World Bank. ""Those that can afford to are turning more to private security who are essentially making a profit out of crime,"" said Thami Nkosi from the Right2Know organisation, which has raised concerns about people being surveilled without consent. ""CCTV cameras don't reduce crime, they displace crime ... They just make criminals more sophisticated: they will put on balaclavas, use inside contacts, speed up their pace. We are not dealing with the root causes of crime.""  PEACE OF MIND Halfway across the globe, Colombia's second city of Medellin has a different model for fighting crime. Once Colombia's murder capital, former no-go slums now boast open-air gyms, hillside cable cars and community halls where youth orchestras play. In the past decade, city mayors have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in social development projects and urban renewal to help bridge the gap between rich and poor and reclaim areas that were once controlled by gangs. There are fewer night-time gun battles since the death in 1993 of city drug lord Pablo Escobar, who ran the world's largest cocaine cartel, though gang violence hotspots persist. Medellin's crime prevention approach focuses on finding alternatives to keep teenagers off the streets and away from gangs who - often with the nicest clothes, motorbikes and money in their pockets from drug dealing - can easily lure them in. About 3,000 young people in Medellin belong to gangs or risk being recruited, according to the mayor's office. Often armed and fighting over turf, neighbourhood gangs control drug trafficking and extortion and prostitution rackets. Six months ago, Johan Rodriguez received an unexpected knock on the door from social workers at his home in a gang-ridden Medellin hillside slum offering him work or training as part of a new programme to keep vulnerable young people away from crime. ""I was mixed up with the gangs then and I was consuming drugs,"" said 25-year-old Rodriguez, one of nearly 1,000 young people aged between 10 and 28 taking part in the ""Parceros"" or ""Mates"" project, which city hall launched last year. It offers support to go back to school, get job interviews and set up small businesses, from textile to DJ companies, as well as activities that help young people make friends across the invisible borders that divide gang territory. ""While the violence is always there, the project showed me there's something else around the corner, another way. It opened up my eyes,"" said Rodriguez, who works in a motorbike factory after social workers sent his CV to employers across the city. ""What I liked the most is that it taught me if you were violent, you felt powerful on the street. But I learned that a person is powerful when they have a peace of mind inside and are happy with themselves."" The programme includes yoga, breathing exercises to deal with anger, and challenges including diving into a swimming pool covered with ice and walking over hot coals. ""The point of the exercises is to show us that we can achieve goals and overcome our fears,"" Rodriguez said.  SUCCESS STORIES Colombia and South Africa are both highly unequal countries struggling to find ways to move on from violent pasts and reduce widespread corruption and unemployment. Community projects like the 'i was shot in joburg :)' shop, which sells photos taken by homeless children at risk of drugs and gang violence, seek to provide alternatives to crime. In Pheko's Diepsloot township, 30 km north of Sandown where he works, people pay 20 rand ($1.30) a month for community-run patrols. ""We see projects come and go if they are functioning in isolation,"" said Stewart Barret, director of Navan Consulting, which analyses future trends in South Africa, calling for better trained police, more jobs and well-functioning schools. Security innovations like Vumacam and Aura - a mobile platform which summons armed responders - are looking to work more closely with the police. ""We know that without the improvement of social and economic issues in the country, we are simply repeatedly filling a broken cup,"" said Warren Myers, founder of Aura. The police are working on a pilot project with private security companies, said police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo, declining to give more details due to confidentiality. ""The South African Police Service welcomes and encourages the involvement of private security in the fight against crime,"" he said. ""They complement our efforts."" Meanwhile, South Africans are doing whatever they can to feel safer, said Jason Mordecai, managing director of 7Arrows. ""People are building their own camera surveillance with equipment bought online. They are using Whatapp groups to share information,"" he said. ""The irony is that sometimes the security walls become so high that you never speak to your neighbours. We become more and more anonymous to one another as we try to hide from crime."" Back in Sandown, Pheko hit the accelerator as an alarm went off in a nearby house. As he leapt out of his car, his radio buzzed. ""False alarm,"" he said, adjusting his gun to continue his daily patrol.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26B4MI	"By Zoe Tabary LONDON, Oct 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Driverless transport, underground shops, heated bike paths, armed street patrols – this is not the setting for a dystopian novel but it could soon be the city where you live. As the world sees the biggest wave of urban growth in history – with almost 70% of its population expected to be living in urban areas by 2050, up from 56% today – the task of making cities greener and safer is becoming more urgent. That cities are attracting more people is nothing new, noted urban specialist Philipp Rode, who runs London-based research centre LSE Cities. ""People move to cities to live and work because they're a solution: they significantly reduce the amount of movement and space required to do anything,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""But the absolute increase in population, the millions coming into cities - that's unprecedented."" The shift is creating significant challenges for many cities already at risk from worsening climate change and rising inequality, with the race on to house swelling populations and tackle homelessness. To cope with these modern-day pressures, cities around the world are trying to become ""smarter"" - from moving storage and retail facilities underground, to using data and technology to improve security, healthcare and mobility. Many cities, particularly in poorer nations, are also facing large and expanding slum populations which lack basic services, fueling inequality, and, in some cases, violence. Mandy Pienaar, a 43-year-old media executive from Johannesburg, knows this only too well. One winter evening, as she and her boyfriend drove home from the movies in the South African city, two armed assailants hijacked their car, stripped them of their clothing and stole their bank cards before the couple managed to escape. ""It was quite shocking because there were a lot of people walking past who kind of looked at me as if this was an everyday occurrence, to see a stripped woman sitting in a slum area in the cold,"" Pienaar recalled. Their ordeal illustrates the ""false sense of security"" that comes with living as they do in a gated community, she said. ""We have bars on every window, huge dogs, electric fencing ... to us that's normal. We've become desensitised."" Community-led projects like ""vuvuzela patrols"" aim to tackle such violence, with groups of men armed with plastic trumpets escorting women on their daily commutes in Johannesburg. But security is not the only worry on urban planners' minds. From the small U.S. city of Duluth to the metropolis of Hong Kong, cities are thrashing out ways to reinvent themselves and revamp how their residents live, move and consume. ""Mobility, water, waste: the world's greatest challenges are solved in cities,"" said Tiina Kaho, head of the Helsinki Metropolitan Smart & Clean Foundation, a coalition of businesses, researchers and state officials. Yet as the world transforms rapidly, ""cities will have to innovate like never before"", she said.  GOING UNDERGROUND From Singapore to sub-Saharan Africa, cities are running out of space to house swelling populations. ""It's a scarce resource,"" said Rode. ""Using that space in the most efficient way possible is crucial."" Historically cities have tended to grow outwards rather than upwards, according to a report published by the World Resources Institute and Yale University in January. But, if uncontrolled, such expansion can make it challenging to deliver basic services, with trips to school or the doctor becoming longer, for example. At the same time, it eats into farmland and can threaten green areas and biodiversity. To be sustainable, cities will need to temper their sprawl with efforts to increase density, researchers said. In Britain, for example, the government announced plans to build hundreds of thousands of new rural homes along its 'Green Belt' - protected areas in the English countryside. For other cities, increasing density will mean putting more facilities below ground - not just subway networks and utilities but commercial, retail and storage facilities too. In Hong Kong, known for its towering skyscrapers and wooded hills, there is a particular urgency to maximise use of underground space, with home and land prices among the world's highest. The government has vowed to free more space for housing through measures like building artificial islands. It is also looking to use underground spaces for waste treatment, data centres, water reservoirs, power stations, crematoriums and sports facilities. ""For the city, it results in more efficient use of space ... and avoids the conflicts of traffic and weather disruptions above ground,"" said Mark Wallace, director of infrastructure at Arup, a consultancy that studied underground space in Hong Kong. Other cities have also gone underground, with Finland's capital Helsinki moving sports facilities and emergency shelters below the surface. Canada's Montreal, meanwhile, has a wide pedestrian network of shops and hotels beneath its streets. In December billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk unveiled a 1.14-mile (1.8 km) tunnel in the Los Angeles area that was dug with new fast, low-cost technology, as a first step to developing a high-speed subterranean network for vehicles. While excavating and building underground is more expensive, there are savings in maintenance and land costs, Wallace said. But underground living is no replacement for better land-use planning, researchers warned, while residents worry construction and access to buried facilities will eat into green space above. Euan Mills, urban design and planning lead at Future Cities Catapult, a UK-funded innovation centre, said cities should ""accommodate nature, but not at the expense of density"". For him, the answer lies in building skywards. ""Human bodies need daylight, so going underground won't work,"" he said.  SAFE CITIES As cities seek space to grow, they must also consider how their development affects social equality, said Rode of LSE Cities. ""In fast-expanding cities the differences between rich and poor increase,"" he said. Neighbourhoods tend to display income disparities, leaving some with better access to services, and leading to what Rode called ""anti-urban gestures"" such as gated communities. In South Africa, the legacy of apartheid-era city planning and rapid urban population growth have contributed to making it the most unequal country by income, according to the World Bank. South Africa's cities remain for the most part racially divided more than 20 years after the end of apartheid, under which millions of black people were forcibly removed from white-only urban areas to live in crowded townships and homelands, with buffer zones separating the races. Those patterns of inequality can stoke grievances, according to urban analysts, with South Africa – which has one of the world's highest murder rates – in July deploying the army to quell a surge in violence in gang-infested parts of Cape Town. That has led to a proliferation of private security firms, such as safety start-up Aura, which created a mobile platform allowing customers to access a network of armed emergency services. ""The police are stretched thin,"" said Warren Myers, founder of Aura, which has received about 25 panic alerts a day from its 70,000 users since its launch in 2017. ""We need to marry as many different technologies as possible - CCTV, facial recognition, data collection, WhatsApp groups - to better protect South Africans,"" he added. But private security is hardly sufficient to tackle crime, analysts warned, as realised by cities in Latin America where drug-fuelled murder rates are among the world's highest. After decades of heavy-handed police tactics in cities in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela and parts of Central America, new methods of tackling crime are gaining currency, with a stronger focus on social development projects. In Colombia's second city of Medellin, this approach has focused on urban renewal in slums: once-neglected shanty districts now boast landscaped parks, open-air gyms, schools, playgrounds and community halls where youth orchestras play. ""Sustained investment in deprived areas ... combined with increased community policing and recreational alternatives, like after-school programmes, have seemed to turn the dial in reducing homicide rates,"" said Robert Muggah, co-founder of the Igarape Institute, a Brazil-based think-tank. After the death of cocaine drug-lord Pablo Escobar in 1993, Medellin's murder rate plunged more than 90% from 266 per 100,000 people in 1991 to 19 per 100,000 in 2018. Medellin resident Johan Rodriguez, 25, decided to retire from gang life after taking part in a six-month programme to keep vulnerable people away from crime. The ""Parceros"" (""Mates"") project, launched last year by city hall, helps teenagers go back to school, get job interviews and set up small businesses, from textiles to DJing. ""While the violence is always there, the project showed me there's something else around the corner, another way,"" said Rodriguez, who now works in a motorbike factory after social workers sent out his CV to employers across the city.  CLIMATE HAVENS Yet as record numbers of people move into cities, some urban areas are facing uncertainty over the future as climate change brings worsening threats, from extreme heat to flooding. One fifth of the world's major cities will experience unprecedented climate conditions by 2050, such as more intense dry and monsoon seasons, according to the Crowther Lab, a Swiss-based research group. Researchers predict that as wild weather becomes more frequent, it could force millions of people to move out of harm's way, with some unable to return. From Indonesia's sinking capital of Jakarta to the Middle East's sweltering cities, that poses a new kind of challenge for urban planners, Rode said. ""Cities have faced numerous events like wars or earthquakes when populations had to be evacuated, but the idea had always been to return and rebuild,"" he said. In response to the threats, some U.S. cities - such as Minnesota's Duluth - are studying efforts to become top destinations for Americans abandoning parts of the country that may one day be made inhospitable by climate change. Angel Dobrow, 59, who works for a small firm that supports farmers, and her husband have already made the move to lakefront Duluth, leaving their longtime home in another part of Minnesota in 2017. ""As a person concerned with climate change, being near freshwater and having a little bit of land to grow food and grow herbs was critical for me,"" said Dobrow, sitting in her lush garden in the northern city. Duluth, located by the world's largest freshwater lake, may not seem the most obvious choice as a haven for climate migrants. With its frigid winters, the metropolis is often ranked as one of the coldest cities in the United States. But Sandy Hoff, the president and owner of local real estate development firm F.I. Salter, said a changing climate could spur a property boom that would ""no doubt"" propel his company in ways unseen since his grandfather acquired it 90 years ago. Dobrow said when summer heat and humidity burden other areas of Minnesota, Duluth's lakefront breezes ""feel like air conditioning"". But some fear an influx of new residents could exacerbate a housing crisis in a city where few new homes have been built. Joel Kilgour, who chairs Duluth's Affordable Housing Coalition and volunteers at housing non-profit Loaves and Fishes, said the city's homeless are forced to seek rooms at the charity as they cannot afford rising rents. ""If we as a community can't solve that, there's no way that we're going to be able to handle an influx of climate refugees in an equitable manner,"" Kilgour said. Potential climate refuge cities may also struggle to build costly infrastructure, such as water treatment plants and energy utilities, without a sufficient tax base ahead of time to pay for them, researchers warned.  SMART CITIES? To try to thrive amid rapid urbanisation and worsening climate change threats, many cities around the world are trying to become ""smarter"". From heated bike paths to melt snow in Toronto to high-tech sensors that detect when Barcelona's bins need emptying, governments are pooling resources from citizens and businesses to make cities more efficient, sustainable and livable. Many of those efforts focus on improving mobility in cities, with urban planners looking at innovative ways to cut both traffic and climate-warming emissions. Dubai - which, according to the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), has more than one vehicle for every two people - is experimenting with driverless mobility pods that aim to combine the comfort of ride-hailing services like Uber with the efficiency and capacity of buses. The cube-shaped vehicles, built by U.S.-based NEXT Future Transportation Inc., can carry up to 10 people each and dock together when in motion, allowing passengers to move from one unit to the other using the front and rear doors. The vehicles – which should enter mass production at the end of 2020 – are designed to pick up single users at home, then pool people going in the same direction inside one module, as other pods are released to collect more passengers. ""It's like a relay race,"" said founder Tommaso Gecchelin. Rode of LSE Cities said it was important one inefficient car system should not be replaced with another, adding autonomous vehicles should carry as many passengers as possible. Allowing private self-driving cars could result in empty vehicles ""just driving around waiting for their owners"", taking up public space needlessly, he warned. Other major smart city initiatives have run into delays or unexpected problems, sparking criticism. Kenya's planned Konza Technopolis – a new $14.5 billion city to be built about 60 km (37 miles) southeast of crowded Nairobi – has fallen behind schedule on its goal of accommodating 20,000 people by 2020, according to Nairobi-based entrepreneurs and analysts. Dubbed the Silicon Savannah, Konza aims to become a modern tech hub but the first building has yet to be completed due to red tape and a lack of funding, critics noted. Lavasa - the first city in India's $7.5 billion plan to turn 100 urban centres into Smart Cities by 2020 - has suffered from design issues, and ignored the needs of poor and marginalised groups, planners and rights groups have said. ""Urban planners, not cities, are the ones who need to get smarter,"" said Mills of Future Cities Catapult, calling for more investment in data collection and training of city planners. ""Google knows more about our cities than planning departments do.""  SLOWER CITIES? Even as some cities become smarter and more efficient, calls also are mounting to slow the frantic pace of urban life. Efforts range from the literal – with many cities pushing for lower speed limits on their roads — to the imaginative, including art installations to promote mindfulness. On a recent ""sound walk"" in the English town of Reading, a dozen residents, including a retired historian and teenage students, strolled silently through parks, graveyards and bookstores. Led by sound artist Richard Bentley, the group uploaded photos and audio recordings from their phones to Hush City, an app that maps quiet areas in cities. With noise pollution the most common cause of environmental complaints in Europe, according to the European Commission, and more people crowding into urban areas, Bentley expects peace and quiet could become a ""commodified luxury"". Historically, poorer groups lower down the social ladder have had to live in noisy parts of cities while those with more means could move away, he said. ""It's incredibly important to keep these quiet spaces and to be aware of their possible disappearance,"" he added. Some places are jumping on the livability bandwagon through Cittaslow, which means ""slow city"" in Italian. The global network of more than 260 cities grades its members according to factors such as sustainable infrastructure, promotion of local economies, fairness and ""good living"". South Korean member Jeonju, a city of about 650,000 people, has planted millions of trees and runs monthly car-free zones since joining in 2016, Mayor Seung-Su Kim said by email. Pier Giorgio Oliveti, the network's secretary general, said the approach could be a ""vaccine"" for the ills of modernity. But Mills of Future Cities Catapult argued that ""one of the most exciting things about cities is how alive they are"". ""I don't think we should be slowing them down,"" he added. Now, more than ever, urban planners and government should ""reflect on what cities are for"", advised LSE Cities' Rode. ""Why are cities such attractive places for living and working? Because they bring people together to enjoy public life,"" he said. ""That real, physical experience needs to be preserved.""

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N2703UC	"By Rina Chandran PENANG, Malaysia, Oct 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - U rban planners in rapidly expanding Asian cities must involve the poorest residents in decision-making and include informal spaces if they are serious about tackling inequality, development experts said on Wednesday. More than 2.3 billion people in Asia-Pacific live in cities, and that number is expected to reach nearly 3.5 billion in 2050, according to the United Nations. But one-third of urban dwellers live in slums or slum-like conditions and are under constant threat of eviction as planners and authorities look to modernise cities, said Elisa Sutanudjaja at the Rujak Center for Urban Studies, a Jakarta think tank. ""Cities in Asia are largely a mix of formality and informality, but urban planning is never neutral: it's all formal vs informal, legal vs illegal,"" she said on the sidelines of a U.N. urban conference in Penang. ""But the right to city is far more than individual liberty to access urban resources and livelihoods; it is also about informality and community."" This year, a majority of Asia-Pacific's population for the first time became urban, with more than half the population living in cities, according to a U.N. report published earlier this week. With growing pressure on resources such as land and water, the region is struggling to make ""effective planning systems a cornerstone of national policy"", said Maimunah Mohd Sharif, executive director of UN-Habitat, the human settlements agency. Cities in the region that are ranked high for liveability, including Singapore, and those in Australia, Japan and South Korea have co-produced solutions with citizens, she said. ""Bridging the digital divide, engaging the urban poor, and building climate resilience must be a priority. We have to ensure equitable distribution of resources,"" said Sharif, a former town planner and mayor of Penang island, off Malaysia's west coast. But increasingly, planners are ignoring the poorest and most vulnerable residents including slum dwellers and street vendors, said Renu Khosla, director of the Centre for Urban & Regional Excellence in New Delhi. ""Our cities are not being planned for the poor. But when cities are planned without people in mind, you get more informal settlements, you get more inequality,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""Perhaps it's time to move away from territorial and land-based planning, and plan around people and their needs."" From Bangkok to Manila, as Asian cities strive to become more modern, street vendors and hawkers are viewed increasingly as a hindrance to city planning and are being evicted from pavements. But public spaces are for the good of all members of the public and must be legally available to everyone, said Chidchanok Samantrakul at WIEGO, a global non-profit that helps informal workers. ""Half the city is informal - informal settlers, street vendors - yet planners only focus on the formal. But there has to be opportunity for everyone to co-exist,"" she said. Several cities in the region are now using Minecraft, a video game that allows players to build their own worlds using virtual Lego-like pieces, to get communities to participate in upgrading their common spaces, under a UN-Habitat programme. In the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi, where women and girls often face harassment on the streets and on public transport, Minecraft was used to identify safety issues and make public spaces safer, said Thu Dao Thi Bao of non-profit Plan International. ""Technology helps give girls and women a voice. We have to encourage their participation in city planning and management."" (Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Michael Taylor.

Globally more than 2 billion people, or nearly one in four, lack access to ""safe, nutritious and sufficient food"", including 8% of Europe and North America's populace, putting their health at risk according to the latest U.N. figures. Based on World Food Day's theme, we asked experts: ""What is the one thing we need to change in the food system to make healthy diets available for everybody?""  MAXIMO TORERO CULLEN, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR-GENERAL, UNITED NATIONS' FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION (FAO) ""Enough food is being produced globally... But food is not being produced where it is most needed. Countries are failing to provide incentives to farmers to produce more nutritious food. ""Countries keep subsidising products with low nutritional value, favouring staple foods — wheat, rice, maize — over fruits and vegetables. This has a negative effect on nutrition and dietary diversity. ""If we want to envision a world free of hunger and malnutrition, production incentives have to change. ""We need better incentives for the world's agricultural producers. Better information to prod consumers into choosing healthier diets. Sustainable trade with clear rules. And a big push to think of nutrition as part of food safety."" JESSICA FANZO, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, JOHN HOPKINS UNIVERSITY AND CO-CHAIR, GLOBAL NUTRITION REPORT ""One thing that would be a game-changer for food systems is for countries to develop holistic food system policies with clear, near and long-term, time-bound actions and goals to be achieved for human and planetary health.

BABA DIOUM, JOINT WINNER OF 2019 AFRICA FOOD PRIZE AND AGRICULTURAL ENTREPRENEUR, SENEGAL ""To respond to such concerns, it is imperative to move towards a new agricultural policy capable of preserving the productive bases of soil, water and biodiversity in order to establish durability.

In Russia's strongest criticism since Turkey launched its military operation last week, President Vladimir Putin's envoy for Syria indicated Moscow wanted Ankara to wrap up its offensive soon. ""We didn't agree with the Turks any questions about their presence in Syria and we don't approve of their actions,"" envoy Alexander Lavrentiev told reporters in Abu Dhabi during an official visit there by Putin. He said Turkish troops had the right under an agreement struck between Damascus and Ankara in 1998, the Adana pact, to temporarily push up to a maximum of 10 km (6 miles) into Syria to conduct counter-terrorism operations. ""But it doesn't give them (Turkish troops) the right to remain on Syrian territory permanently and we are opposed to Turkish troops staying on Syrian territory permanently,"" he said. Lavrentiev made his comments as Turkey pressed ahead with its offensive in northern Syria despite U.S. sanctions and growing calls for it to stop, while Syria's Russia-backed army moved on the key city of Manbij that was abandoned by U.S. forces. The Kremlin said late on Tuesday that Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan had phoned Putin. The Russian leader had used the call to complain about the humanitarian situation on the Turkish-Syrian border and had stressed the need to avoid a clash between Turkish and Syrian forces, it said. Putin had told Erdogan that the situation whereby Islamic State prisoners being held in custody by Syrian Kurds were exploiting the chaos by trying to escape was unacceptable, the Kremlin said. Putin had also invited Erdogan to visit Russia in the coming days for urgent talks, a proposal Ankara had accepted, it added. Lavrentiev, Putin's Syria envoy, earlier on Tuesday told Russian news agencies that Moscow had always considered any kind of Turkish military operation on Syrian territory unacceptable. His comments, which suggest growing tensions between Turkey and Russia, came a day after the Kremlin complained that Turkey's incursion was ""not exactly"" compatible with Syrian territorial integrity. ""The security of the Turkish-Syrian border must be ensured by the deployment of Syrian government troops along its entire length,"" said Lavrentiev. ""That's why we never spoke in favour or supported the idea of Turkish units (being deployed there) let alone the armed Syrian opposition."" Lavrentiev said Turkey's actions risked upsetting delicate religious sensitivities in northern Syria. In particular, he said the area was populated by Kurds, Arabs and Sunnis who would not take kindly to their lands being resettled by people who had never lived there, a reference to Turkey's plan to house refugees from other parts of Syria there. Lavrentiev confirmed that Russia had brokered an agreement between the Syrian government and Kurdish forces that saw the Kurds cede control of territory to Syrian troops. Those talks had taken place at Russia's Hmeimim air base in Syria among other places, he said. Russia's influence in Syria and the Middle East is widely seen to have been boosted in the last week thanks to Washington scaling back its Syria operation and the Syrian Kurds striking a deal with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Moscow's closest ally in the region. Lavrentiev said Moscow was hoping that the United States would withdraw all of its forces from Syria. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu spoke to his U.S. counterpart about Syria on Tuesday evening. Russian military police are patrolling the line of contact between Syrian and Turkish government troops. Lavrentiev estimated there were around 12,000 Islamic State prisoners being held in northeast Syria.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_KBN1WU2K6	"By Dominic Evans, Orhan Coskun and Tom Perry ANKARA/BEIRUT (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of Syria radically realigns the balance of power in the country's northeast and creates a vacuum which Russia, Turkey and Iran are racing to fill. With Turkish forces pressing south from the border, the Kurds have invited troops from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's Russian-backed government in from the south and the west. Assad's forces are exploiting the U.S. retreat to seize back resource-rich territory they abandoned years ago.  The area includes most of the Syrian lands that formed the ""caliphate"" of the Islamic State group, whose fighters have gone underground but vowed to stage a comeback. More than 10,000 Islamic State prisoners, including many hardened foreign jihadis whose Western governments refuse to take them back, are in prisons there, and tens of thousands of their family members are in camps. Here is a summary of what the U.S. withdrawal means for those rushing in and those left behind.  WHAT IS THE AIM OF TURKEY'S OFFENSIVE? Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan says he wants to settle up to two million Syrian refugees, many of them of them Sunni Arabs, into the region targeted in the operation, territory which is currently controlled by Kurdish-led forces. Turkish troops and Ankara-backed Syrian rebels have focused in the first week of operations on driving Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters from two major border towns, Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain, about 120 km (75 miles) apart. Despite a chorus of global criticism, Erdogan has said nothing will stop operations against Kurdish YPG fighters, considered terrorists by Ankara because of their links to guerrillas waging an insurgency in southeast Turkey. Erdogan has said Turkey will seize a border strip running hundreds of km (miles) from Kobani in the west to Hasaka in the east and 30-35 km (18 to 22 miles) deep inside Syria.  A Turkish official told Reuters the operation was proceeding ""quite rapidly and successfully"". The first phase would be complete by Nov. 13, when Erdogan is due to meet Trump during a visit to Washington, he said, without specifying how far Turkey would have gone by then.  WHAT ARE ASSAD'S GOALS? The full withdrawal of U.S. forces and deployment of the Syrian army is a major juncture in the Syrian conflict, restoring a foothold for Assad's government across the biggest swath of the country that had been outside its grasp. The area includes oil, farmland, water resources and the hydro-electric dam at Tabqa - vital assets that will better position the government to cope with the impact of Western sanctions. Syrian state media have said troops have reached the M4 highway that runs east-west around 30 km (18 miles) south of the frontier with Turkey, on the edge of Ankara's planned ""safe zone"". On Tuesday they entered Manbij, in an area that had been patrolled jointly by Turkey and the United States. Assad's army, however, has been weakened by the attrition of prolonged conflict, and now relies heavily on Russia, Iran and Iran's Shi'ite militia allies including Lebanon's Hezbollah.   WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR KURDISH AUTONOMY? Syria's Kurdish groups exploited the withdrawal of government forces from the northeast at the start of the Syrian conflict to build up the institutions of autonomy and teach Kurdish language in local schools.  Exposed to Turkish attack by the U.S. withdrawal, they invited the Syrian army back - a decision that highlighted their weakness and signalled an end to many of their dreams. They will hope to preserve as much of their autonomy as possible in political talks with the Syrian state - their long declared objective. But they no longer have a powerful ally to back them.  Still, Damascus and the SDF share the objective of driving Turkey from northern Syria, or at least halting its advance. ""Damascus needs the Kurds. The Kurds and Damascus have two things in common: enmity for Turkey and a desire not to see Sunni rebel militias ruling the northeast of Syria,"" said Joshua Landis, head of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma. ""But they don't agree on anything when it comes to ruling northeast Syria.""  WHAT WILL BECOME OF ISLAMIC STATE? The Kurdish-led SDF was the main force on the ground in the U.S.-backed offensive that recaptured the Syrian lands of Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliphate, including the group's de facto capital Raqqa. Before its pullout, Washington had been preparing to train and equip an SDF force to stabilise the area, to prevent a return by the militants, who carried out large massacres of Kurds in towns they had controlled. The SDF says the Turkish offensive has helped energise Islamic State sleeper cells, just a year after the ""caliphate"" was effectively dismantled. Islamic State has already claimed responsibility for attacks, including a deadly car bomb strike outside a restaurant in the biggest Kurdish city Qamishli just a day after Turkey launched its incursion. Since the fighting started last week, the SDF says there has also been unrest in the prisons where they are holding the fighters, and in camps holding their wives and children.  POTENTIAL IRANIAN WIN  Assad’s ally Iran is also set to gain. Iraqi paramilitary groups backed by Iran on the Iraq-Syria border will likely help Assad secure control, strengthening their own supply lines along a corridor of territory from Tehran to Beirut.   WHAT DOES RUSSIA WANT? Russia's indispensable role in Syria reflects a larger shift in the Middle East from Damascus to Riyadh, as showcased by President Vladimir Putin's Gulf tour this week, including his first visit to Saudi Arabia in more than a decade. It was Russia's intervention with air power in 2015 which helped turn the tide of Syria's civil war in Assad's favour, and Trump's decision to pull out of the northeast has cemented Moscow's central role in shaping the country's future.  ""There are Turkish-Russian talks ... to set the tempo for northern Syria, particularly east of the Euphrates,"" said a regional pro-Damascus source. ""They are the ones moving all these plans."" The Turkish official said Ankara is ""working in very close cooperation with Russia"", and Erdogan pointed on Monday to Russia's importance when he said that President Vladimir Putin had shown a ""positive approach"" to the situation. The two countries may be able to forge an agreement dividing the northern border into new control zones and prevent their local allies - the Syrian government on the one hand and anti-Assad insurgents on the other - from going to war. ""I think there will be real friction but I do think the Russians will be able to manage it. There is a deal to be made,"" said Joshua Landis, an expert on Syria and head of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma.

""There are Turkish-Russian talks ... to set the tempo for northern Syria, particularly east of the Euphrates,"" said a regional pro-Damascus source. ""They are the ones moving all these plans."" The Turkish official said Ankara is ""working in very close cooperation with Russia"", and Erdogan pointed on Monday to Russia's importance when he said that President Vladimir Putin had shown a ""positive approach"" to the situation. The two countries may be able to forge an agreement dividing the northern border into new control zones and prevent their local allies - the Syrian government on the one hand and anti-Assad insurgents on the other - from going to war. ""I think there will be real friction but I do think the Russians will be able to manage it. There is a deal to be made,"" said Joshua Landis, an expert on Syria and head of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N2702MB	"By Naimul Karim DHAKA, Oct 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Canadian yoga pants specialist, Lululemon Athletica Inc, said on Tuesday it was investigating a factory in Bangladesh over the treatment of female workers making its clothes. Factory workers said they were verbally abused, beaten, forced to work overtime and paid about 85 pounds ($110) a month - less than the cost of a pair of leggings sold by the company - according to an investigation by The Guardian newspaper. The national minimum wage in the South Asian country was increased to $95 a month last year but workers' unions had demanded about twice as much - 16,000 taka ($189). The rights of workers in Bangladesh, a global manufacturing hub, have come under increased scrutiny in recent years, particularly since the Rana Plaza factory collapse in 2013 that killed more than 1,100 people. ""Members of Lululemon's social responsibility and production team visited the factory in Bangladesh immediately to speak with workers and learn more,"" a Lululemon spokesman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by e-mail. ""We will work with an independent non-profit third party to fully investigate the matter. While our production at this factory is extremely limited, we will ensure workers are protected from any form of abuse and are treated fairly."" The company added that there were currently no orders planned from this factory in Chittagong, about 260 km (160 miles) from the capital Dhaka. The factory owner was named as Korean-based company Youngone Corp which did not respond to emails from the Thomson Reuters Foundation requesting comment. But Youngone Corp told The Guardian that it had started an internal review regarding the matter and employees were encouraged to share opinions or launch complaints through various channels. Bangladesh - the second largest supplier of clothes to Western countries after China - relies on the garment industry for more than 80% of exports and 4 million jobs, with big brands under pressure to ensure products are responsibly sourced. Rubana Huq, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), a trade organisation of garment manufacturers, criticised the investigation for trying to ""tarnish the country image"". ""The report did not make it clear about how many workers it interrogated,"" Huq told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""The truth, correctness and credibility of the information provided by the workers (respondents) was not verified which makes the report flawed.""

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26E2FX	"By Annie Banerji NEW DELHI, Oct 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Shoved, cursed and ridiculed, Nisha's hospital visits were always stressful as a transgender woman and got worse after she was diagnosed as HIV-positive. But a new app introduced as part of a drive to end an HIV epidemic in India by 2030 is providing her and the transgender community better access to doctors, lifesaving drugs - and hope - although it has raised concerns about digital privacy. India has the world's third largest population living with HIV - 2.1 million people - according to UNAIDS, with recognition that help is needed in the transgender community where the prevalence is 3.1% compared to 0.26% among all adults. Nisha tested HIV positive last year after earning a living as a sex worker in New Delhi. On the job, she said, condoms would often break or she would not use one for more money. ""That was a bad idea. I ended up with HIV. I felt suicidal after I found out,"" Nisha, 29, a trans woman who goes by one name, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""It didn't help that going to the hospital was torturous. People made faces, passed lewd comments ... a doctor even kicked me out."" Despite the Supreme Court recognising India's 2 million transgender people as a third gender with equal rights in 2014, they are often kicked out by their families and denied jobs, education and healthcare, leading them to begging or sex work. Trans women like Nisha say they face ""double discrimination"" and the risk of being shunned and abused - first because of their gender identity and then because of their HIV status. But a counselling programme along with a new app is helping health workers track down HIV-positive transgender people, monitor their treatment and link them to doctors and antiretroviral therapy (ART) to suppress the AIDS virus. ""I have found new strength. I don't feel depressed or nervous anymore,"" said Nisha, who now begs at traffic lights. ""The app helps keep me physically healthy and she ensures I'm mentally and emotionally (healthy),"" she said, pointing to her outreach worker Samyra, an HIV-positive trans woman. The eMpower app - developed by IBM in partnership with India HIV/AIDS Alliance and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria - monitored more than 1.2 million people between January 2018 and March 2019.  'HALF THE BATTLE WON' With mobile tablets in hand, HIV-positive transgender outreach workers keep a tab on others in their community living with HIV and counsel them and accompany them to see doctors. ""I tell them 'I'm like you. I'm HIV-positive and I'm taking medicines too. You're not alone',"" said Samyra, who works with Vihaan, a national initiative to expand counselling, outreach and follow-up programmes to people living with HIV. ""That makes a huge difference because it's coming from one of your own. Half of the HIV battle is won when you have someone to hold your hand along the way."" Health experts said transgender focused initiatives like this and the launch in March of India's first HIV treatment clinic in Mumbai city run for and by LGBT+ people were pushing the country towards its target to end the epidemic by 2030. But to achieve this target they said it was critical for patients to stick with ART. Sometimes stigma and side effects can cause them to drop out of the treatment. That is why health workers follow up with clients every few months and record information on the eMpower app, including their weight, viral load and CD4 - white blood cells that fight HIV - and advise them on everything from their diet to safe sex. They also note whether a client has faced discrimination, and arrange for partners and family members to get tested. Sonal Mehta, head of India HIV/AIDS Alliance, said the app has helped boost Vihaan's outreach numbers as well as the confidence of trans clients and workers, who often come from poor, semi-literate backgrounds. ""The trans clients definitely feel much more secure ... but the outreach workers themselves also feel very empowered. They are professional officers working on the field, talking to doctors, government officers, engaging with various organisations,"" she said.  DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD While such technological advances are seen as key in the HIV/AIDS fight, health and software experts warn they can come at the cost of privacy. The eMpower app creates a profile for each client with personal information including name, biometric ID number, occupation and monthly income, and a map pinning their location. Without proper safeguards, such an app runs the risk of data breach and sharing information with third-parties, which can further ostracise an already marginalised community, said Ambika Tandon, a cyber security expert. ""The potential to monetise is definitely a risk factor,"" said Tandon, policy officer in gender-based research at the Banaglore-based Centre for Internet and Society. ""Another is informational privacy ... (clients) may not necessarily know where their information is being stored, who will have access to it ... There could be multiple points at which their data could be vulnerable."" Saravanan RM, a senior technical officer at India HIV/AIDS Alliance, said the eMpower app a ""fool-proof system"". He said all sensitive data was stored on the organisation's server, which could only be accessed by specific workers through a password-protected system. None of the information can be seen by any partners - not IBM, state or federal governments. It is further beefed up by a mobile device management (MDM), he said. ""For example, if any device is lost or has gone into someone else's hands, what we can do through MDM is clean out the entire tablet and the data will not be acquired,"" he said. Dr. V Sam Prasad, India programme manager of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, said the app should not be dismissed because there was a privacy risk as it came with major benefits. Several HIV-positive transgender people like Swati, a trans woman who contracted HIV after injecting drugs, felt the same. ""Even if it (personal data) is leaked, what's the worst that could happen? I've faced unimaginable things. Nothing scares me, at least not such things,"" said Swati, 25, after a follow-up meeting with her outreach worker at her one-room home. ""It is (eMpower) saving me. It is not an enemy.""

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_KBN1WT0ZC	"By Steve Holland, Ellen Francis and Tuvan Gumrukcu WASHINGTON/BEIRUT/ANKARA (Reuters) - President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Turkey on Monday and demanded the NATO ally stop a military incursion in northeast Syria that is rapidly reshaping the battlefield of the world's deadliest ongoing war. Trump, who gave what critics say was a de facto green light for Turkey's assault by ordering U.S. forces away from the conflict area, requested the ceasefire in a call with President Tayyip Erdogan.  ""The United States of America simply is not going to tolerate Turkey's invasion in Syria any further. We are calling on Turkey to stand down, end the violence and come to the negotiating table,"" Vice President Mike Pence told reporters. Trump also announced plans to reimpose steel tariffs on Turkey and immediately halt negotiations on a $100 billion trade deal. The move was quickly criticized as too little, too late by the top Democrat in Congress. ""His announcement of a package of sanctions against Turkey falls very short of reversing that humanitarian disaster,"" said U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Turkey aims to neutralize the Kurdish YPG militia, the main element of Washington's Kurdish-led ally, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which has been a key U.S. ally in dismantling the jihadist ""caliphate"" set up by Islamic State militants in Syria. Ankara regards the YPG as a terrorist group aligned with Kurdish insurgents in Turkey. Russia-backed Syrian forces on Monday took rapid advantage of the abrupt U.S. retreat in Syria to deploy deep inside territory held by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces south of the Turkish frontier. Washington had announced plans for a full withdrawal from northern Syria less than 24 hours earlier. Washington's Kurdish former allies said they invited in the government troops as an emergency step to help fend off the Turkish assault, launched on Wednesday after what the Kurds called a U.S. betrayal. The Syrian army deployment is a victory for President Bashar al-Assad and his most powerful ally, Russia, giving them a foothold in the biggest remaining swath of the country that had been beyond their grasp.  They will now face Turkish armed forces along a new front line hundreds of miles (km) long. Syrian state media reported the army entered Manbij, a town that had been controlled by a militia allied to the Kurds. Earlier, it pushed into Tel Tamer, a town on the strategically important M4 highway that runs east-west around 30 km (19 miles) south of the frontier with Turkey.  State television later showed residents welcoming Syrian forces into the town of Ain Issa, which lies on another part of the highway, hundreds of miles away. Ain Issa commands the northern approaches to Raqqa, former capital of the Islamic State caliphate, which Kurdish fighters recaptured from the militants two years ago in one of the biggest victories of a U.S.-led campaign. Much of the M4 skirts the southern fringe of territory where Turkey aims to set up a ""safe zone"" inside Syria. Turkey said it had seized part of the highway. An official of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said clashes were ongoing.  U.S. STRATEGY UNRAVELING The swift Syrian government deployments underscored how suddenly the strategy the United States had pursued in Syria for the past five years had unraveled. Washington said on Sunday it was pulling out its entire force of 1,000 troops, which had provided air support, ground assistance and training for Syrian Kurds against Islamic State since 2014. Trump said U.S. troops would remain at a small garrison at Tanf in southern Syria ""to continue to disrupt remnants"" of Islamic State. But the base would do little to support operations elsewhere in the country. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, better known for his backing of Trump, joined his critics to express concern over the Syria pullout, saying it would ""invite the resurgence"" of Islamic State. ""Such a withdrawal would also create a broader power vacuum in Syria that will be exploited by Iran and Russia, a catastrophic outcome for the United States' strategic interests,"" he said in a statement. A U.S. official said on Monday a diplomatic team working to help stabilize territory captured from Islamic State had already pulled out. U.S. troops were still on the ground but early phases of their withdrawal had started, the official said.  Two other U.S. officials have told Reuters the bulk of the U.S. pullout could be completed within days. The Trump administration has denied its troop pullback triggered the Turkish incursion. ""I can tell you with complete confidence that nothing that we did one way or the other was going to deter the Turks from what they wanted to do,"" a senior Trump administration official said.  U.S. PARTNERS Thousands of fighters from a Kurdish-led force have died since 2014 battling Islamic State in partnership with the United States, a strategy the Trump administration had continued after inheriting it from his predecessor, Barack Obama. ""After the Americans abandoned the region and gave the green light for the Turkish attack, we were forced to explore another option, which is talks with Damascus and Moscow to find a way out and thwart these Turkish attacks,"" senior Kurdish official Badran Jia Kurd said. Jia Kurd described the new arrangement with Assad's forces as a ""preliminary military agreement"", and said political aspects would be discussed later. It remains to be seen how the Kurds will be treated now. Kurdish fighters began carving out autonomous rule in Syria's northeast early in its eight-year-old war, benefiting from diversions of Assad's military to fight elsewhere. Assad aims to restore his government's authority across all of the country. Senior Kurdish politician Aldar Xelil called the pact with Damascus ""an emergency measure"". ""The priority now is protecting the border's security from the Turkish danger."" Trump says he aims to extract the United States from ""endless"" wars in the Middle East. ""Anyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte,"" Trump wrote on Twitter earlier on Monday. ""I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!""  NEW FRONT LINE In a speech during a visit to Azerbaijan, Erdogan said: ""We are determined to continue the operation until the end, without paying attention to threats."" ""Our battle will continue until ultimate victory is achieved,"" he added. The Turkish Defense Ministry said 560 militants had been ""neutralized"" since the operation began. Earlier, Erdogan said 500 militants had been killed, 26 surrendered and 24 were wounded so far. The U.S. exit leaves Turkey and Russia, as well as Iran, Assad's main Middle East ally, as Syria's undisputed foreign power brokers. Ankara and Moscow both predicted they would avoid conflict in Syria, even as the front line between them will now spread across the breadth of the country. ""There are many rumors at the moment. However, especially through the embassy and with the positive approach of Russia in Kobani, it appears there won't be any issues,"" Erdogan said when asked about the prospect of confrontation with Russia.  Kobani, on the Turkish border, is one of the first Kurdish-held cities where reports emerged of possible Syrian government deployment.  Trump also spoke to the commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, General Mazloum Kobani Abdi. Mazloum expressed concerns about the Syrian city of Kobani and asked Trump to raise that issue directly with Erdogan, Pence said. Trump raised the issue with Erdogan, who provided a firm commitment not to attack Kobani, said Pence. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the suggestion that Russia could clash with Turkish forces. ""We wouldn't even like to think of that scenario,"" he said. The fighting has raised concerns that the Kurds would be unable to keep thousands of Islamic State fighters in jail and tens of thousands of their family members in camps. The region's Kurdish-led administration said 785 Islamic State-affiliated foreigners escaped a camp at Ain Issa over the weekend. The British-based war monitor Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, citing sources in the camp, said the number who escaped was smaller, around 100. EU countries have threatened to impose sanctions on Turkey over the assault. But at a meeting on Monday, they agreed not to impose an embargo. Member countries would instead consider their own restrictions on sales of weapons, a measure likely to be brushed off as trivial, as arms account for just 45 million euros out of more than 150 billion euros in Turkey-EU trade. U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he would call on NATO allies to ""take collective and individual"" actions against Turkey when he meets defense chiefs in Brussels next week. Republican and Democratic leaders of the U.S. Congress have announced plans to impose their own sanctions. Turkey's trade with the United States is a fraction of its trade with Europe.

""Anyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte,"" Trump wrote on Twitter earlier on Monday. ""I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!""  NEW FRONT LINE In a speech during a visit to Azerbaijan, Erdogan said: ""We are determined to continue the operation until the end, without paying attention to threats."" ""Our battle will continue until ultimate victory is achieved,"" he added. The Turkish Defence Ministry said 560 militants had been ""neutralised"" since the operation began. Earlier, Erdogan said 500 militants had been killed, 26 surrendered and 24 were wounded so far. The U.S. exit leaves Turkey and Russia, as well as Iran, Assad's main Middle East ally, as Syria's undisputed foreign power brokers. Ankara and Moscow both predicted they would avoid conflict in Syria, even as the front line between them will now spread across the breadth of the country. ""There are many rumours at the moment. However, especially through the embassy and with the positive approach of Russia in Kobani, it appears there won't be any issues,"" Erdogan said when asked about the prospect of confrontation with Russia.  Kobani, on the Turkish border, is one of the first Kurdish-held cities where reports emerged of possible Syrian government deployment.  Trump also spoke to the commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, General Mazloum Kobani Abdi. Mazloum expressed concerns about the Syrian city of Kobani and asked Trump to raise that issue directly with Erdogan, Pence said. Trump raised the issue with Erdogan, who provided a firm commitment not to attack Kobani, said Pence. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the suggestion that Russia could clash with Turkish forces. ""We wouldn't even like to think of that scenario,"" he said. The fighting has raised concerns that the Kurds would be unable to keep thousands of Islamic State fighters in jail and tens of thousands of their family members in camps. The region's Kurdish-led administration said 785 Islamic State-affiliated foreigners escaped a camp at Ain Issa over the weekend. The British-based war monitor Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, citing sources in the camp, said the number who escaped was smaller, around 100. EU countries have threatened to impose sanctions on Turkey over the assault. But at a meeting on Monday, they agreed not to impose an embargo. Member countries would instead consider their own restrictions on sales of weapons, a measure likely to be brushed off as trivial, as arms account for just 45 million euros out of more than 150 billion euros in Turkey-EU trade. U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper said he would call on NATO allies to ""take collective and individual"" actions against Turkey when he meets defence chiefs in Brussels next week. Republican and Democratic leaders of the U.S. Congress have announced plans to impose their own sanctions. Turkey's trade with the United States is a fraction of its trade with Europe.

Trump, who gave what critics say was a de facto green light for Turkey's assault by ordering U.S. forces away from the conflict area, requested the ceasefire in a call with President Tayyip Erdogan. ""The United States of America simply is not going to tolerate Turkey's invasion in Syria any further. We are calling on Turkey to stand down, end the violence and come to the negotiating table,"" Vice President Mike Pence told reporters. Trump also announced plans to reimpose steel tariffs on Turkey and immediately halt negotiations on a $100 billion trade deal. The move was quickly criticized as too little, too late by the top Democrat in Congress. ""His announcement of a package of sanctions against Turkey falls very short of reversing that humanitarian disaster,"" said U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Turkey aims to neutralize the Kurdish YPG militia, the main element of Washington's Kurdish-led ally, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which has been a key U.S. ally in dismantling the jihadist ""caliphate"" set up by Islamic State militants in Syria. Ankara regards the YPG as a terrorist group aligned with Kurdish insurgents in Turkey. Russia-backed Syrian forces on Monday took rapid advantage of the abrupt U.S. retreat in Syria to deploy deep inside territory held by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces south of the Turkish frontier. Washington had announced plans for a full withdrawal from northern Syria less than 24 hours earlier. Washington's Kurdish former allies said they invited in the government troops as an emergency step to help fend off the Turkish assault, launched on Wednesday after what the Kurds called a U.S. betrayal. The Syrian army deployment is a victory for President Bashar al-Assad and his most powerful ally, Russia, giving them a foothold in the biggest remaining swath of the country that had been beyond their grasp. They will now face Turkish armed forces along a new front line hundreds of miles (km) long. Syrian state media reported the army entered Manbij, a town that had been controlled by a militia allied to the Kurds. Earlier, it pushed into Tel Tamer, a town on the strategically important M4 highway that runs east-west around 30 km (19 miles) south of the frontier with Turkey. State television later showed residents welcoming Syrian forces into the town of Ain Issa, which lies on another part of the highway, hundreds of miles away. Ain Issa commands the northern approaches to Raqqa, former capital of the Islamic State caliphate, which Kurdish fighters recaptured from the militants two years ago in one of the biggest victories of a U.S.-led campaign. Much of the M4 skirts the southern fringe of territory where Turkey aims to set up a ""safe zone"" inside Syria. Turkey said it had seized part of the highway. An official of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said clashes were ongoing.  U.S. STRATEGY UNRAVELING The swift Syrian government deployments underscored how suddenly the strategy the United States had pursued in Syria for the past five years had unraveled. Washington said on Sunday it was pulling out its entire force of 1,000 troops, which had provided air support, ground assistance and training for Syrian Kurds against Islamic State since 2014. Trump said U.S. troops would remain at a small garrison at Tanf in southern Syria ""to continue to disrupt remnants"" of Islamic State. But the base would do little to support operations elsewhere in the country. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, better known for his backing of Trump, joined his critics to express concern over the Syria pullout, saying it would ""invite the resurgence"" of Islamic State. ""Such a withdrawal would also create a broader power vacuum in Syria that will be exploited by Iran and Russia, a catastrophic outcome for the United States' strategic interests,"" he said in a statement. A U.S. official said on Monday a diplomatic team working to help stabilize territory captured from Islamic State had already pulled out. U.S. troops were still on the ground but early phases of their withdrawal had started, the official said. Two other U.S. officials have told Reuters the bulk of the U.S. pullout could be completed within days. The Trump administration has denied its troop pullback triggered the Turkish incursion. ""I can tell you with complete confidence that nothing that we did one way or the other was going to deter the Turks from what they wanted to do,"" a senior Trump administration official said.  U.S. PARTNERS Thousands of fighters from a Kurdish-led force have died since 2014 battling Islamic State in partnership with the United States, a strategy the Trump administration had continued after inheriting it from his predecessor, Barack Obama. ""After the Americans abandoned the region and gave the green light for the Turkish attack, we were forced to explore another option, which is talks with Damascus and Moscow to find a way out and thwart these Turkish attacks,"" senior Kurdish official Badran Jia Kurd said. Jia Kurd described the new arrangement with Assad's forces as a ""preliminary military agreement"", and said political aspects would be discussed later. It remains to be seen how the Kurds will be treated now. Kurdish fighters began carving out autonomous rule in Syria's northeast early in its eight-year-old war, benefiting from diversions of Assad's military to fight elsewhere. Assad aims to restore his government's authority across all of the country. Senior Kurdish politician Aldar Xelil called the pact with Damascus ""an emergency measure"". ""The priority now is protecting the border's security from the Turkish danger."" Trump says he aims to extract the United States from ""endless"" wars in the Middle East.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L8N24X0N2	"By Nanchanok Wongsamuth BANGKOK, Oct 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Human traffickers in Thailand have ignored court orders to compensate victims in more than 99% of cases in recent years, fuelling fears that many survivors could be re-trafficked, data obtained exclusively by the Thomson Reuters Foundation revealed. Thai courts have ordered traffickers to pay their victims more than 130 million baht ($4.3 million) for damages caused in about 1,335 cases since 2014, according to the latest available statistics from the Office of the Attorney General. But the money was only paid in five cases, with survivors receiving a total of 5.6 million baht - excluding cases settled out of court - found data from the government's anti-trafficking department, obtained via Thailand's freedom of information law. Although Thailand has rescued a record-breaking 1,000-plus trafficking victims this year, campaigners are concerned that the failure to pay compensation will leave them in fresh danger. ""It's an important issue that is unfortunately being neglected,"" said Chonticha Tangworamongkon, a program director at the Human Rights and Development Foundation, which provides free legal aid to migrant workers and trafficking victims. ""This money will enable (victims) to start a new life and prevent them from being re-trafficked, but the government's role in assisting victims in pursuing the claims is still not clear."" Thailand is considering amending its 1999 anti-money laundering law to allow offenders' assets seized by the Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO) to be used to compensate victims. Four public hearings were held this year to discuss the legal amendment - seized assets are currently state property - but it is unclear when it will be reviewed by the cabinet. Thailand is home to about 610,000 modern slaves - about one in 113 of its 69 million people - according to the Global Slavery Index by the rights group Walk Free Foundation. The United States called on Thailand in June to increase compensation to victims in its annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report - which ranked it as a Tier 2 country - meaning it is making significant efforts to combat the crime. Trafficking victims are automatically compensated through a government fund - which provides living and rehabilitation expenses and lost wages - but Tangworamongkon said these sums of money were not sufficient for victims to rebuild their lives. While Thai law allows victims to claim compensation from convicted traffickers, offenders have refused to pay in more than 1,000 cases - for which there is no legal punishment. The law requires the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security to assist victims in enforcing their compensation claims, yet anti-trafficking charities and campaigners say it has failed to ensure that fines are collected from offenders. But pursuing claims is a complex process, which involves tracing offenders' assets and bringing in the Legal Execution Department - which enforces court orders - to seize them. Ratchapon Maneelek, a director at Thailand's anti-trafficking department, which falls under the social ministry, said several government agencies had been holding meetings to determine the extent of their legal powers to enforce claims. ""This is something new for us that we may not have expertise in,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  NO MONEY, NO PAY Aged nine, Bo Soe's mother took him from Myanmar to Thailand in 2013, where he was forced by a trafficker to sell roses. For five years, Bo Soe and about 10 other children were forced to tout to tourists in a backpacker district in Bangkok from 6 p.m. to 5 a.m. without pay, eating only one meal a day. ""It was very horrible and I was scared. Whenever I couldn't sell all (the roses), I would be beaten,"" the 15-year-old told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Thailand's western region of Mae Sot, where he lives with his grandmother and aunt. In May, judges upheld a lower court ruling convicting a man and woman of trafficking, jailing them for 12 years. They were then ordered to pay 1.26 million baht in compensation to Bo Soe. ""I don't know whether or not I will receive the money ... but I'm happy to be back with my family,"" said Bo Soe, whose name has been changed to protect his identity as a minor. Papop Siamhan, a lawyer who has followed the case, said Bo Soe was unlikely to ever receive the money, since the traffickers could not afford the compensation, and the long prison sentence meant they would not be able to gather the cash. Lawyers and charities, which are often hired by trafficking victims to trace offenders' assets and enforce compensation orders, say seizures by AMLO can actually thwart survivors' efforts to obtain restitution. ""If it's a case involving the fishing sector, for instance, AMLO will seize the vessels and freeze the bank accounts of offenders,"" said Siamhan. ""(This) means the victims' lawyer will have to track down other assets.""  ""OUR LIVES ARE CHEAP"" Sugunya Rattananakintr, a public prosecutor who focuses on human trafficking cases, said court rules should be amended to require offenders who were ordered to pay compensation to do so before they were allowed to appeal their sentences and fines. ""The problem is the enforcement of compensation orders since the ministry doesn't have knowledge in this area,"" she said. ""If you wait until the case reaches the highest court, the offenders will transfer all their assets, leaving them with nothing left to pay (in compensation to victims)."" Maneelek from the anti-trafficking division said the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security and other related government agencies signed an agreement last year to help victims with their cases and track down offenders' assets. ""We are in the process of looking for ways to cooperate (within government), which might take some time,"" he said. However, time is not a luxury that many victims can afford. Having been trafficked at 22 and forced to work on a fishing boat for three years without pay, Aung Aung was hopeful when the six traffickers were jailed for 10 years in July and ordered to pay about 2 million baht in compensation to their victims. But Aung Aung does not know when he will receive the 65,000 baht he was awarded - if at all - and is looking for work at sea again in southern Thailand despite knowing the risks involved. ""It was like hell, working so hard ... for more than three years. Our lives are so cheap on the boat,"" he said. ""I hope I will get the compensation money some day.""

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N26Z39A	(Repeats for clients in Asia.) By Tom Allard BANGKOK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - He is Asia’s most-wanted man. He is protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private jet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night at a Macau casino. Tse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected of leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate formed out of an alliance of five of Asia’s triad groups, according to law enforcement officials. Its members call it simply “The Company.” Police, in a nod to one of Tse’s nicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for “Brother Number Three.” The syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of methamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen countries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South Pacific. But meth – a highly addictive drug with devastating physical and mental effects on long-term users – is its main business, they say. In what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate’s meth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be as high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the cartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a 40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has expanded at least fourfold in the past five years. This unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an unprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the prime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously unreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the Australian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about 20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far the biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug trafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in the investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar, China, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan, while not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the investigation. A document containing AFP profiles of the operation’s top 19 syndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the leader of the syndicate. According to the document, the organization has “been connected with or directly involved in at least 13 cases” of drug trafficking since January 2015. The document does not provide specific details of the cases. A Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the “Multinational CEO” of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional government agencies says Tse is “believed to be” the leader of the Sam Gor syndicate. Police have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected boss of the trafficking group. Some investigators say that the scope of the syndicate’s operation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin America’s most legendary narco-traffickers. “Tse Chi Lop is in the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,” said Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC. “The word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no doubt it applies here.” Reuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to questions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on investigations. During the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific to uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This included interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement officials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence reports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings and other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in Myanmar’s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia’s Golden Triangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing drugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited the Thai compound of one of the syndicate’s alleged drug lords. What emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly transnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the AFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often refer to as “T1” - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China. The syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and sophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin American cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies a bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a more diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels do, including Japan’s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic Chinese gangs across Southeast Asia. The crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled outbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police say. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked rivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a united pursuit of gargantuan profits. “The crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate with seamless efficiency,” says one veteran Western anti-drugs official. “They function like a global corporation.” Like most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed, the investigator spoke on condition of anonymity. In addition to the contrasts between their drug operations, there’s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop and Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed Mexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine trafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their extravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has been revealed about Tse’s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug lords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.  A TRIP, A TRAP Tse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern China, and grew up during China’s Cultural Revolution. Amid the bloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group of imprisoned members of Mao’s Red Guard in the southern city of Guangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big Circle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police, and like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong Kong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their criminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988. In the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong, Macau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based in Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling ring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless opium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand, China and Laos meet. In 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on drug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New York. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into America, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over his head. Through a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged for leniency. His ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His 12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed. If freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed “great sorrow” for his crime, court records show. The entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to nine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional institution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned. After he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to Canada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for the next four years. It’s unclear when Tse returned to his old haunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife registered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company Ltd, in Hong Kong in 2011. Police suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He “picked up where he left off,” said the senior AFP investigator. Tse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and the Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved irresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his drug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no extra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers. His policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for business, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011, AFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and meth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather than arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under surveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely for more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug cell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They wanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate. The syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other drug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and selling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the syndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the Melbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police watched the Australian meet two men. One of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted hair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese family man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance showed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal security. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eight worked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as part of his security protocol. Tse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts and five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in private jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand for a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt, according to a member of the task force investigating the syndicate. Tse was a frequent visitor to Asia’s casinos and fond of betting on horses, especially on English races. “We believe he lost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the tables in Macau,” said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator. As the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected that the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia with meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the Sam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say, when a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of white powder strapped to each of his thighs.  ‘ALADDIN’S CAVE OF INTEL’ Cai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the airport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It was the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous, picking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said a former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation. “His hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,” the commander told Reuters. “Methamphetamine is very toxic.” Cai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs was a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful tranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. “We were very fortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,” the commander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been monitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police had no idea who he was. Cai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a “pesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,” according to Myanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A friend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father. Cai’s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for ketamine at the airport, the commander said. Unimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight. The next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport. One recognized him from surveillance work he’d been conducting. Still, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they later found on one of his phones might have explained his silence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least three assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch and electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said one investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy saying “Loyalty to the Heavens.” The banner was a “triad-related sign,” he added. The tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed the video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat because he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a law enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of the victim’s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad members were sending a message about the price of disloyalty, the officers said. Reuters has not seen the video. The torture videos were just one of the items allegedly found in Cai’s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was a diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate’s activities, but sloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones, police say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media conversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages. They were “an Aladdin’s Cave of intel,” said one AFP commander based in North Asia. For at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly travelled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for the syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the Drug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its investigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip from an international courier company recording the delivery of two consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf Chinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea packets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had been cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region. Two days after Cai’s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon address, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That evening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon jetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so, Myanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but other than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate, including couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking. Then came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery of photos and videos on Cai’s phones, an AFP investigator based in Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing he had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier. “This one stuck out because it was Canadian,” he recalled. “I said: ‘Fuck, I know who you are!'” It was Tse Chi Lop. The Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of intelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work on Cai’s phones. Australia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime gangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade, the AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and small, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent described the database, which includes a trove of names, chemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and surveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence on Asian drug trafficking groups in the region. The AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai’s phones with the database. They discovered photos related to three big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in China, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators and Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese anti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and addresses in Cai’s phones to other meth busts in China. For regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations upended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by different crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the work of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics agent said they believed Cai was “one of the members of a mega-syndicate,” which had been involved in multiple “drugs cases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.” Cai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still in jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking charges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to contact Cai’s lawyer.  METH PARADISE During his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing the country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and obtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a bigger vessel in international waters, according to police and the Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures of the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where the meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat. The police reconstruction of Cai’s dealings in Myanmar led to another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production had shifted from China’s southern provinces to Shan State in Myanmar’s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had provided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor ingredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were smuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the freedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement. Armed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan State have long controlled large tracts of territory and used drug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the military. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar government with rebel groups over the years has brought relative calm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to flourish. “Production facilities can be hidden from law enforcement and other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,” analyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the International Crisis Group. “Drug production and profits are now so vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.” The Myanmar government and police did not respond to questions from Reuters. Along the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there is evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts a deep ravine known as the “Valley of Death,” where ethnic Kachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for decades with Myanmar’s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past trucks carrying building materials and workers. The Kaung Kha militia’s immaculate and expansive new headquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green hills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers away, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved out of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned out vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba tablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine. When it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more than 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg of caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances used in drug production. The Loikan facility was “very likely” to have been the source of much of the Sam Gor syndicate’s meth, said the Yangon-based AFP officer. “Some militia were involved in the lab,” said Oi Khun, a communications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia, in an interview. He paused, then added: “But not with the knowledge of senior members” of the militia. One person in Loikan described how workers from the lab would come down from the hills. The men, like most of the villagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the locals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them. “I asked them once. ‘Why don’t you bathe?’” the person said. “They said they did, but there was nothing they could do about the smell.” The rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the skin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature stench might reveal their illicit activities. “We all knew,” the person said. “We just didn’t talk about it. That just brings you danger.” Meth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals, say Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network’s couriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the Asia-Pacific. Shan’s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the world, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told Reuters. “They can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the ground and let it dry.” The UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth is worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business model for meth is “very different” to heroin, said the UNODC’s Douglas. “Inputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not needed, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore far, far higher.” The wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in northeastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a UNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control Commission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to the UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand, $298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the Japanese market, that’s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up. The money the syndicate is making “means that if they lose ten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,” said the Chinese counter-narcotics official. “They can afford failure. It doesn’t matter.”  ‘MONEY, MONEY’ The analysis of Cai’s phones was continuing to provide leads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the pick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with Myanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at sea for weeks. One of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the Shun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement document reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea when, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a marine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and paid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV Valkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s and hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea sickness tablets. According to local media, he didn’t have a fishing license at the time. After buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on a course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in the Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the rendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western Australian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was seen “unloading a lot of packages” into a van, the commander said. “We knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of organized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and comes back with some gear on it, that it hasn’t just dropped from the sky in the middle of the ocean.” Investigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car hire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug traffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say, that some of Smith’s alleged co-conspirators were members of an ethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and Comanchero motorcycle gangs, known as “bikies” in Australia. As they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of crystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor syndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy of an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians reconvened in Perth a month later. Bikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and a self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had refined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star hotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police investigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants, said the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth. The restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that included caviar with toast at about $185 per serving. On November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again, this time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the Andaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth from Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the Indian Ocean. The Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened. When the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in international waters off the West Australian coast on December 19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting “money, money,” according to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De Man’s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith and his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved their identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by the crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth. The Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of Geraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The men unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of the AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault weapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty to importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of his alleged associates are still on trial. Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it had “worked together with our counterparts on the investigation” of the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the “substantial seizure of illicit narcotics” by the Australian authorities in December 2017. The bureau said it was “aware that Taiwanese syndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in (the) Asia-Pacific region,” and was working “collaboratively and closely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and cross-border drug trafficking.”  NIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED As the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police concluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone a kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the three biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the 1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The other two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse’s original triad, and the Bamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator, the syndicate’s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that it “must rival Apple’s.” “The syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market to tap,” said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior colonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade. “The power this network possesses is unimaginable.” Investigators have had wins. In February last year, police busted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough tea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66 was intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than one tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor lieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar. In December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected syndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand. Located near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed compound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used to experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a 100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to the back of the property. Sue wasn’t there, but property and money from 38 bank accounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized during the investigation. Sue is still at large. But the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the wider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal meth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and Southeast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in most countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising seizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019, “suggested the supply of the drug had expanded.” In the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive adversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug motherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product in shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth coming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the syndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This included deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each containing about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on narrow jungle paths. Over the years, police have had little success in taking down Asia’s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders have been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to the AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics kingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than a short period was in the mid-1970s. That’s when Ng Sik-ho, a wily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium and morphine, according to court records. So far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho’s fate. He is being tracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say counter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they believe he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed. (Reporting by Tom Allard. Additional reporting by Reuters Staff.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_KBN1WT1ZD	"(Reuters) - Syrian Kurdish forces, scrambling to push back a Turkish invasion, have reached a deal with Damascus for Syrian army troops to deploy near the Turkish border, throwing into question the future of their region. The deal is intended to halt a Turkish offensive into northeast Syria after U.S. troops began vacating the area, in a sudden policy shift by President Donald Trump that has been widely criticised in Washington as a betrayal of America's Kurdish allies. Ankara says it wants to create a ""safe zone"" to resettle millions of refugees currently living in Turkey. This would then serve as a buffer against what Turkey sees as its main security threat in Syria - Kurdish YPG fighters who Ankara says are linked to militants waging an insurgency inside Turkey.    Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran all have large Kurdish minorities seeking varying degrees of autonomy from central governments after decades of repression. This is an overview of their status.  HISTORY The Kurdish ethnic minority, mainly Sunni Muslims, speaks a language related to Farsi and lives mostly in a mountainous region straddling the borders of Armenia, Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey. Kurdish nationalism stirred in the 1890s when the Ottoman Empire was on its last legs. The 1920 Treaty of Sevres, which imposed a settlement and colonial carve-up of Turkey after World War One, promised them independence. Three years later, Turkish leader Kemal Ataturk tore up that accord. The Treaty of Lausanne, ratified in 1924, divided the Kurds among the new nations of the Middle East.  SYRIA Before Syria's popular uprising erupted in 2011, Kurds formed 8-10 percent of the population. The Baathist state, championing Arab nationalism, had deprived thousands of Kurds of citizenship rights, banned their language and clamped down on Kurdish political activity. During the war, President Bashar al-Assad focused on crushing mainly Sunni Arab rebels with the help of Russia and Iran, turning a blind eye as Kurdish fighters carved out self-rule across northern and eastern Syria. Assad has vowed to recover the northeast, but the two sides have kept some channels open. Syrian Kurdish leaders say they do not seek partition but rather regional autonomy as part of Syria.  The Kurdish YPG militia's power grew after partnering with U.S. troops to defeat Islamic State. While the U.S. deployment provided a security umbrella that helped Kurdish influence expand, Washington opposed the group's autonomy plans. The Kurds had emerged as among the war's biggest winners, controlling about a quarter of the country — territory rich in oil, water and farmland - with their own armed forces and bureaucracy. But the U.S. withdrawal and the Kurds' decision to invite Syrian government troops to fend off Turkey's assault puts the fate of their region in doubt.  TURKEY Kurds form about 20 percent of Turkey's population. The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) took up arms against the state in 1984, waging an insurgency for autonomy in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast. Since then, more than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict. PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was captured in 1999, tried and sentenced to death. That was later reduced to life in prison after Turkey abolished the death penalty. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has removed restrictions on using the Kurdish language. The government held talks with Ocalan, who is in jail on an island near Istanbul, in 2012, but they broke down and the conflict has revived. The United States, the European Union and Turkey classify the PKK as a terrorist organization. Turkey's military has often struck targets in Iraq's Kurdish region near the PKK’s stronghold in the Qandil mountains. Erdogan has said he will crush Syria’s YPG, which Ankara sees as a branch of the PKK, and has sent troops into northern Syria to mount offensives rolling back the Kurdish fighters.  IRAQ Kurds form 15-20 percent of the population, mainly inhabiting the three northern provinces of Iraqi Kurdistan. Saddam Hussein's rule targeted Iraqi Kurds in the late 1980s when chemical gas was used, villages were razed and thousands of Kurds were forced into camps. Their region has been semi-autonomous since 1991, has its own regional government and armed forces, but still relies on the Baghdad central government for its budget. When Islamic State militants swept through much of northern Iraq in 2014, Kurdish fighters exploited the collapse of central authority to take control of Kirkuk, the oil city they regard as their ancient regional capital, as well as other territory disputed by Baghdad and the Kurdish north. Iraqi government forces and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, with U.S. backing, defeated Islamic State which had captured swathes of northern Iraq.  Iraq's Kurds held a referendum on independence in September 2017, which backfired and triggered a regional crisis in the face of opposition from Baghdad and regional powers. The vote prompted military and economic retaliation from Baghdad, which retook the territory seized by Kurdish forces since 2014. Ties have since improved, but tensions remain over oil exports and revenue-sharing.  IRAN Kurds form about 10 percent of the population. In 2011, Iran pledged to step up military action against the Party of Free Life of Kurdistan, a PKK offshoot that has sought greater autonomy for Kurds in Iran. Rights groups say Kurds, along with other religious and ethnic minorities, face discrimination under the ruling clerical establishment. The elite Revolutionary Guards have put down unrest in the Kurdish community for decades, and the country’s judiciary has sentenced many activists to long jail terms or death. Iran's military has demanded Iraqi authorities hand over separatist Kurdish dissidents stationed there and close their bases.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26Z50E	"By Emma Batha LONDON, Oct 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When a children's hospital in Aleppo was decimated in 2016 after multiple bombings, British-Syrian doctor Rola Hallam decided to turn her grief into action. Within weeks the London consultant anaesthetist was on the way to the Syrian border with enough equipment to build the world's first crowdfunded hospital. ""Thousands of people from around the world came together to raise the money we needed,"" said Hallam, who won the Women of the Year lifetime achievement award in London on Monday. ""The Syrian doctors and nurses were blown away. For the first time they felt heard and seen by people around the world. It gave them so much hope that they named it Hope Hospital."" The hospital, which has since treated 200,000 children, is supported by CanDo, a social enterprise Hallam set up to help local humanitarians in warzones crowdfund lifesaving work that larger aid organisations often cannot do. ""In Syria, I've really seen the absolute worst of humanity, but I've also seen the very best,"" Hallam told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at the award ceremony. ""The remarkable doctors and nurses that I've had the honour and privilege to work with inspire me and motivate me every single day."" Hallam, 40, who moved to Britain as a teenager after growing up in Damascus, said the idea for CanDo was born in 2013 when she was working in a Syrian field hospital in rural Aleppo. She was among medics who treated children for horrific burns after a schoolyard was bombed. It was a heartbreaking day made even worse because Hallam did not have all the equipment, medicines and resources she needed to help the children. ""I should have been able to give them sedation and pain killers, put a breathing tube in ... Instead, I had to send them suffocating and in pain to Turkey,"" she said.  ""BEYOND BURNT-OUT"" Although Syrian non-governmental organisations carry out 75% of humanitarian work they receive less than 1% of aid funds for the country, Hallam said, a pattern also seen in other warzones. At the same time Hallam said there is growing public disillusionment with some bigger charities, with many people wanting to know exactly how and where their donations go. Not only are local humanitarians first on the scene, but they can reach communities cut off from other aid and remain after other agencies have pulled out. They also share the same culture and language as the people they are helping. Hallam said CanDo had raised 1.3 million pounds ($1.6 million) since 2017 for projects that have helped 500,000 people. It wants to expand to Yemen, South Sudan and Myanmar. In Syria, Hallam would like to see mental health support and rest breaks for the ""heroes"" on the frontline. ""International aid workers get rest and recuperation. Local aid workers do not get any of that. They are beyond burnt-out. Imagine, eight years of this hell,"" she said. Hallam said attacks on Syria's health services were used as a weapon of war and were ""crimes against humanity"". She said there had been more than 500 attacks on hospitals, 90% by Syrian forces and their allies, and more than 800 of her colleagues had been killed, many under torture. ""This is premeditated destruction ... in order to terrorise a civilian population into submission,"" she said. But she warned that the destruction of Syria's health infrastructure also had global repercussions - fuelling the refugee crisis and raising the risks that Syria will be the source of the next Ebola-scale health emergency. ""If we don't rebuild Syria's healthcare system we are going to be the next exporter of these global diseases,"" she said.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26Z530	"(Updates with details in paras 16 to 23) By Nita Bhalla NAIROBI, Oct 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda will not impose the death penalty for gay sex, a presidential spokesman said on Monday, after major aid donors  said they were monitoring a plan by the African nation to reintroduce a bill colloquially known as ""Kill the Gays"". Uganda's Ethics and Integrity Minister Simon Lokodo last Thursday said the government planned to re-introduce an anti-homosexuality bill in parliament within weeks to curb the spread of homosexuality in the east African nation. Lokodo's statement was widely reported across the world and international donors such as the European Union, World Bank, the United States and the Global Fund said they were monitoring the situation closely and stood by the rights of LGBT+ people. A spokesperson for President Yoweri Museveni on Monday said the government has no plans to introduce the legislation that would impose the death penalty for gay sex. ""There are no plans by the government to introduce a law like that,"" Don Wanyama, President Museveni's senior press secretary told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""We have the penal code that already handles issues of unnatural sexual behaviour so there is no law coming up."" Lokodo told the Thomson Reuters Foundation and local press last week that the bill was about to be tabled in the largely conservative Christian country where gay sex is currently punishable with  life imprisonment under British colonial law. This prompted major aid donors on Friday to voice concerns, and a government spokesman took to Twitter on Saturday to deny any such plan. It was not possible to confirm any link between the donors' concerns and the government spokesman's statement on Saturday.  VIOLENCE AND PREJUDICE When asked why Lokodo had made the statement, Wanyama said: ""Ask him. I don't know where he got this idea from. There is no plan by government to introduce a law of that nature."" Lokodo said the bill - that was nullified five years ago on a technicality - was being resurrected and would be voted on by the end of the year. ""Our current penal law is limited. It only criminalises the act,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""We want it made clear that anyone who is even involved in promotion and recruitment has to be criminalised. Those that do grave acts will be given the death sentence."" Lokodo did not immediately respond to calls and messages from the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Monday. Earlier this year, Brunei in Southeast Asia sparked international outcry over plans to impose the death penalty for gay sex, backtracking only after intense criticism. African countries have some of the world's most prohibitive laws governing homosexuality with same-sex relationships considered taboo and gay sex deemed a crime across most of the continent, with punishments ranging from imprisonment to death. Uganda is seen as one of the most difficult countries in Africa to be in a sexual minority with members of the LGBT community facing prejudice in getting jobs, renting housing or seeking medical care or education. LGBT+ rights groups report that three gay men and one transgender woman had been killed in homophobic attacks in Uganda this year - the latest on Oct. 4 when a gay man was bludgeoned to death. Rejected by their families and fearful for their lives, hundreds of LGBT+ Ugandans have fled over the last five years to seek refuge to countries such as neighbouring Kenya. Human rights groups said Lokodo's comments would inflame homophobic attitudes further. ""This is an example of how Uganda's politicians are stoking dangerous intolerance and bias against LGBTI people,"" said Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International's director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes, in a statement.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N26Z2Z6	"By Nita Bhalla NAIROBI, Oct 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda will not impose the death penalty for gay sex, a presidential spokesman said on Monday, after major aid donors  said they were monitoring a plan by the African nation to reintroduce a bill colloquially known as ""Kill the Gays"". Uganda's Ethics and Integrity Minister Simon Lokodo last Thursday said the government planned to re-introduce an anti-homosexuality bill in parliament within weeks to curb the spread of homosexuality in the east African nation. Lokodo's statement was widely reported across the world and international donors such as the European Union, World Bank, the United States and the Global Fund said they were monitoring the situation closely and stood by the rights of LGBT+ people. A spokesperson for President Yoweri Museveni on Monday said the government has no plans to introduce the legislation that would impose the death penalty for gay sex. ""There are no plans by the government to introduce a law like that,"" Don Wanyama, President Museveni's senior press secretary told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""We have the penal code that already handles issues of unnatural sexual behaviour so there is no law coming up."" Lokodo told the Thomson Reuters Foundation and local press last week that the bill was about to be tabled. This prompted major aid donors on Friday to voice concerns, and a government spokesman took to Twitter on Saturday to deny any such plan. It was not possible to confirm any link between the donors' concerns and the government spokesman's statement on Saturday. When asked why Lokodo had made the statement, Wanyama said: ""Ask him. I don't know where he got this idea from. There is no plan by government to introduce a law of that nature."" Lokodo said the bill - that was nullified five years ago on a technicality - was being resurrected and would be voted on by the end of the year. ""Our current penal law is limited. It only criminalises the act,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation."" ""We want it made clear that anyone who is even involved in promotion and recruitment has to be criminalised. Those that do grave acts will be given the death sentence."" Lokodo did not immediately respond to calls and messages from the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Earlier this year, Brunei sparked international outcry over plans to impose the death penalty for gay sex, backtracking only after intense criticism.

The deal is intended to halt a Turkish offensive into northeast Syria after U.S. troops began vacating the area, in a sudden policy shift by President Donald Trump that has been widely criticized in Washington as a betrayal of America's Kurdish allies. Ankara says it wants to create a ""safe zone"" to resettle millions of refugees currently living in Turkey. This would then serve as a buffer against what Turkey sees as its main security threat in Syria - Kurdish YPG fighters who Ankara says are linked to militants waging an insurgency inside Turkey.    Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran all have large Kurdish minorities seeking varying degrees of autonomy from central governments after decades of repression. This is an overview of their status.  HISTORY The Kurdish ethnic minority, mainly Sunni Muslims, speaks a language related to Farsi and lives mostly in a mountainous region straddling the borders of Armenia, Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey. Kurdish nationalism stirred in the 1890s when the Ottoman Empire was on its last legs. The 1920 Treaty of Sevres, which imposed a settlement and colonial carve-up of Turkey after World War One, promised them independence. Three years later, Turkish leader Kemal Ataturk tore up that accord. The Treaty of Lausanne, ratified in 1924, divided the Kurds among the new nations of the Middle East.  SYRIA Before Syria's popular uprising erupted in 2011, Kurds formed 8-10 percent of the population. The Baathist state, championing Arab nationalism, had deprived thousands of Kurds of citizenship rights, banned their language and clamped down on Kurdish political activity. During the war, President Bashar al-Assad focused on crushing mainly Sunni Arab rebels with the help of Russia and Iran, turning a blind eye as Kurdish fighters carved out self-rule across northern and eastern Syria. Assad has vowed to recover the northeast, but the two sides have kept some channels open. Syrian Kurdish leaders say they do not seek partition but rather regional autonomy as part of Syria.  The Kurdish YPG militia's power grew after partnering with U.S. troops to defeat Islamic State. While the U.S. deployment provided a security umbrella that helped Kurdish influence expand, Washington opposed the group's autonomy plans. The Kurds had emerged as among the war's biggest winners, controlling about a quarter of the country — territory rich in oil, water and farmland - with their own armed forces and bureaucracy. But the U.S. withdrawal and the Kurds' decision to invite Syrian government troops to fend off Turkey's assault puts the fate of their region in doubt.  TURKEY Kurds form about 20 percent of Turkey's population. The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) took up arms against the state in 1984, waging an insurgency for autonomy in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast. Since then, more than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict. PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was captured in 1999, tried and sentenced to death. That was later reduced to life in prison after Turkey abolished the death penalty. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has removed restrictions on using the Kurdish language. The government held talks with Ocalan, who is in jail on an island near Istanbul, in 2012, but they broke down and the conflict has revived. The United States, the European Union and Turkey classify the PKK as a terrorist organization. Turkey's military has often struck targets in Iraq's Kurdish region near the PKK’s stronghold in the Qandil mountains. Erdogan has said he will crush Syria’s YPG, which Ankara sees as a branch of the PKK, and has sent troops into northern Syria to mount offensives rolling back the Kurdish fighters.  IRAQ Kurds form 15-20 percent of the population, mainly inhabiting the three northern provinces of Iraqi Kurdistan. Saddam Hussein's rule targeted Iraqi Kurds in the late 1980s when chemical gas was used, villages were razed and thousands of Kurds were forced into camps. Their region has been semi-autonomous since 1991, has its own regional government and armed forces, but still relies on the Baghdad central government for its budget. When Islamic State militants swept through much of northern Iraq in 2014, Kurdish fighters exploited the collapse of central authority to take control of Kirkuk, the oil city they regard as their ancient regional capital, as well as other territory disputed by Baghdad and the Kurdish north. Iraqi government forces and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, with U.S. backing, defeated Islamic State which had captured swathes of northern Iraq.  Iraq's Kurds held a referendum on independence in September 2017, which backfired and triggered a regional crisis in the face of opposition from Baghdad and regional powers. The vote prompted military and economic retaliation from Baghdad, which retook the territory seized by Kurdish forces since 2014. Ties have since improved, but tensions remain over oil exports and revenue-sharing.  IRAN Kurds form about 10 percent of the population. In 2011, Iran pledged to step up military action against the Party of Free Life of Kurdistan, a PKK offshoot that has sought greater autonomy for Kurds in Iran. Rights groups say Kurds, along with other religious and ethnic minorities, face discrimination under the ruling clerical establishment. The elite Revolutionary Guards have put down unrest in the Kurdish community for decades, and the country’s judiciary has sentenced many activists to long jail terms or death. Iran's military has demanded Iraqi authorities hand over separatist Kurdish dissidents stationed there and close their bases.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26Z3OU	"By Annie Banerji NEW DELHI, Oct 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A baby girl found buried alive in India was a suspected case of female infanticide, police said on Monday, the latest to highlight the preference for sons in a country where the number of girls has been declining. A couple, who went to bury their newborn at a grave after she died in hospital, discovered the youngster inside an earthen pot buried several feet deep, said a police officer in Bareilly city in northern Uttar Pradesh state. ""Their spade hit the pot and they heard a baby's cries coming from it,"" the officer told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on the condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media. ""They immediately called the cemetery guard, who said that he saw the parents there earlier. It seems to be a case of female infanticide,"" he said, adding that the baby was about five days old. The baby was rushed to a nearby hospital, where she is recovering, he said. Police are looking for the parents. India has seen a dwindling number of girls, according to a government survey released in July, suggesting that illegal abortions of female fetuses continue despite a ban and government efforts to save girl children. It showed that India's gender ratio, or the number of females per 1,000 males, was 896 in the period of 2015-17, down from 898 in 2014-16 and 900 in 2013-15. The number was 943 in the last census of 2011. Indian laws ban doctors and health workers from sharing an unborn child's sex with the parents, or carrying out tests to determine the child's gender. Only registered medical practitioners are allowed to perform abortions. Yet female feticide is common in parts of India. Daughters are often seen as a burden, with families having to pay dowries when they marry, while sons are prized as breadwinners who can inherit property and continue the family name. In 2017, police found nearly 20 aborted fetuses dumped in plastic bags in the western state of Maharashtra.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L8N2533NS	"By Chitra Nagarajan MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Oct 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - K ellu became pregnant after a Nigerian soldier offered her food and shelter in exchange for sex. But the destitute teenager - who lost her family when Boko Haram militants attacked her village two years earlier - did not want to have the baby. After moving to a camp for displaced people in northeastern Borno state, where she relied on neighbours for food, 18-year-old Kellu wanted an abortion but did not know where to go - like a growing number of women since the Islamist insurgency began. ""If I continue with this pregnancy, it will ruin my life,"" Kellu, who guessed she was about two months pregnant, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, sitting on a mat in a building pock-marked with bullet holes. ""Everyone will know what I did. They will stigmatise me for having a baby without a husband. Also, I have no money to take care of myself. How am I supposed to look after a child?"" asked Kellu, who declined to publish her real name. Nigeria has some of the world's most restrictive abortion laws, which only allow abortion to save the life of the mother. The Johns Hopkins University estimates that 2.7 million abortions are carried out in Nigeria each year, the majority performed secretly and in dangerous conditions, with poor, uneducated women most at risk. Health and aid workers say unsafe abortions have surged in northern Nigeria since the start of the Boko Haram conflict in 2009, which has driven 1.8 million Nigerians from their homes, according to the United Nations. At least 40 women and girls come in for emergency post-abortion care each month, said Aminu, a senior nurse in a busy government clinic in Yobe state - west of Borno state - about three times the average of 10 to 15 a month a decade earlier. Nigeria has the fourth highest maternal mortality rate globally, according to the World Health Organization, with about 100 women and girls dying each day. Death rates in the northeast - where clinics and hospitals have been destroyed as armed groups fight to create an Islamic caliphate - are the worst in Nigeria, government data shows. Women and girls go to pharmacies, vendors of locally made drugs and older women to terminate pregnancies, using medication, herbs or tools like sticks, Aminu said. Fatima, is was in her 40s, went to an aunt who gave her herbs that caused a miscarriage in a few hours. ""It wasn't a choice, I had to end it,"" said Fatima, who declined to publish her real name, who was raising five children and four grandchildren in a displaced camp in Borno state. ""Men say it's immorality. But they are not the ones who have to give birth and look after the babies. When your children are telling you they are hungry, how can you have another one?"" she asked, adding foetuses are often found in the camp's toilets. Nigerian officials insist the law is upheld. ""Regardless of circumstances, abortion is prohibited except for medical reasons,"" said Ali Grema, deputy director of emergency medical response in the health ministry in Borno state. ""It is not allowed for social reasons."" TABOO With many husbands missing, detained or dead, more women are having sex outside marriage, aid workers said. While some women choose to get into new relationships, the United Nations has recorded thousands of cases of sexual violence and transactional sex, particularly by women and girls who lack food, shelter or money. ""Many people who are displaced live with hosts who take advantage of them. If they say no, they may lose their housing,"" said Maryam Aje, head of the African Youth for Peace Development and Empowerment Foundation, which gives women business grants. Pointing to a poster in a Maiduguri camp encouraging women to space their children, Hadiza - a nurse working in a nearby clinic - said family planning messages focused on married women because of conservative attitudes. ""Women will ask for contraception but they don't want husbands to know,"" said Hadiza, who declined to publish her real name. ""(They) come at night, when nobody is around."" Hadiza said she often received calls or visits from young women after working hours, asking for the morning-after pill. ""It's better to prevent such pregnancies than try and deal with them when they happen,"" she said. Many girls do not even know sex can make them pregnant, said Lucy Dlama of Women in New Nigeria, which supports rape survivors with health care. ""Our culture means it is taboo for parents to discuss sex education with their daughters,"" said Dlama, who encourages mothers to teach girls about their bodies. ""They can think it is stomach pain, give birth and then panic."" Aminu, the nurse, said most of his patients needing post-abortion care were teenagers who tried to abort after several months because they did not know they were pregnant or hid it. ""They do not die if we admit them to hospital,"" he said. ""But there are so many more cases where women and girls take herbs on their own, do not come to the hospital and die because they do not want to expose themselves."" Pregnancy outside marriage is a taboo, even when it is the result of rape by soldiers, militias or camp officials. ""They consider you to be a whore and your child to be a bastard. You have spoiled your family name,"" Aminu said. Another factor is a decades-old U.S. government policy, known as the global ""gag rule"" and reinstated by President Donald Trump in 2017, barring clinics that receive federal funds from talking to patients about abortion. ""We see young girls and women requesting abortion,"" said one aid worker who worked to support health clinics across Borno state and spoke on condition of anonymity. ""But we are constrained by concerns about legal risks, community reactions and by our U.S. funding which prohibits us from providing abortion information or services."" Turning desperate women away is dangerous, said Hauwa Shekarau of IPAS, an advocacy group promoting safe abortion. ""If the hospital will not help, she will go elsewhere - even if it is unsafe. We bury our heads in the sand and women continue to die,"" she said. (Reporting by Chitra Nagarajan; Editing by Katy Migiro.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_KBN1WT1J1	By Tom Allard BANGKOK (Reuters) - He is Asia’s most-wanted man. He is protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private jet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night at a Macau casino. Tse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected of leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate formed out of an alliance of five of Asia’s triad groups, according to law enforcement officials. Its members call it simply “The Company.” Police, in a nod to one of Tse’s nicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for “Brother Number Three.” The syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of methamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen countries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South Pacific. But meth – a highly addictive drug with devastating physical and mental effects on long-term users – is its main business, they say. In what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate’s meth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be as high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the cartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a 40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has expanded at least fourfold in the past five years. This unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an unprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the prime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously unreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the Australian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about 20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far the biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug trafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in the investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar, China, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan, while not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the investigation. A document containing AFP profiles of the operation’s top 19 syndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the leader of the syndicate. According to the document, the organization has “been connected with or directly involved in at least 13 cases” of drug trafficking since January 2015. The document does not provide specific details of the cases. A Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the “Multinational CEO” of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional government agencies says Tse is “believed to be” the leader of the Sam Gor syndicate. Police have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected boss of the trafficking group. Some investigators say that the scope of the syndicate’s operation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin America’s most legendary narco-traffickers. “Tse Chi Lop is in the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,” said Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC. “The word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no doubt it applies here.” Reuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to questions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on investigations. During the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific to uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This included interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement officials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence reports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings and other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in Myanmar’s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia’s Golden Triangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing drugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited the Thai compound of one of the syndicate’s alleged drug lords. What emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly transnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the AFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often refer to as “T1” - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China. The syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and sophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin American cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies a bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a more diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels do, including Japan’s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic Chinese gangs across Southeast Asia. The crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled outbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police say. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked rivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a united pursuit of gargantuan profits. “The crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate with seamless efficiency,” says one veteran Western anti-drugs official. “They function like a global corporation.” Like most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed, the investigator spoke on condition of anonymity. In addition to the contrasts between their drug operations, there’s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop and Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed Mexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine trafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their extravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has been revealed about Tse’s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug lords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.  A TRIP, A TRAP Tse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern China, and grew up during China’s Cultural Revolution. Amid the bloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group of imprisoned members of Mao’s Red Guard in the southern city of Guangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big Circle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police, and like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong Kong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their criminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988. In the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong, Macau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based in Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling ring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless opium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand, China and Laos meet. In 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on drug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New York. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into America, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over his head. Through a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged for leniency. His ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His 12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed. If freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed “great sorrow” for his crime, court records show. The entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to nine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional institution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned. After he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to Canada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for the next four years. It’s unclear when Tse returned to his old haunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife registered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company Ltd, in Hong Kong in 2011. Police suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He “picked up where he left off,” said the senior AFP investigator. Tse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and the Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved irresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his drug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no extra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers. His policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for business, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011, AFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and meth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather than arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under surveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely for more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug cell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They wanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate. The syndicate bosses in Hong Kong were irate - their other drug rings in Australia were collecting their narcotics and selling them without incident. In 2013, as the patience of the syndicate leaders wore thin, they summoned the leader of the Melbourne cell to Hong Kong for talks. There, Hong Kong police watched the Australian meet two men. One of the men was Tse Chi Lop. He had the center-parted hair and casual fashion sense of a typical middle-aged Chinese family man, said one AFP agent. However, further surveillance showed Tse was a big spender with a keen regard for his personal security. At home and abroad, he was protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers, said three AFP investigators. Up to eight worked for him at a time, and they were regularly rotated as part of his security protocol. Tse would host lavish birthday parties each year at resorts and five-star hotels, flying in his family and entourage in private jets. On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand for a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt, according to a member of the task force investigating the syndicate. Tse was a frequent visitor to Asia’s casinos and fond of betting on horses, especially on English races. “We believe he lost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the tables in Macau,” said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator. As the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected that the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia with meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the Sam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say, when a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of white powder strapped to each of his thighs.  ‘ALADDIN’S CAVE OF INTEL’ Cai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the airport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It was the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous, picking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said a former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation. “His hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,” the commander told Reuters. “Methamphetamine is very toxic.” Cai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs was a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful tranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. “We were very fortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,” the commander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been monitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police had no idea who he was. Cai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a “pesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,” according to Myanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A friend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father. Cai’s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for ketamine at the airport, the commander said. Unimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight. The next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport. One recognized him from surveillance work he’d been conducting. Still, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they later found on one of his phones might have explained his silence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least three assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch and electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said one investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy saying “Loyalty to the Heavens.” The banner was a “triad-related sign,” he added. The tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed the video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat because he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a law enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of the victim’s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad members were sending a message about the price of disloyalty, the officers said. Reuters has not seen the video. The torture videos were just one of the items allegedly found in Cai’s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was a diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate’s activities, but sloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones, police say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media conversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages. They were “an Aladdin’s Cave of intel,” said one AFP commander based in North Asia. For at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly traveled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for the syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the Drug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its investigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip from an international courier company recording the delivery of two consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf Chinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea packets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had been cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region. Two days after Cai’s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon address, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That evening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon jetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so, Myanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but other than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate, including couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking. Then came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery of photos and videos on Cai’s phones, an AFP investigator based in Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing he had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier. “This one stuck out because it was Canadian,” he recalled. “I said: ‘Fuck, I know who you are!'” It was Tse Chi Lop. The Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of intelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work on Cai’s phones. Australia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime gangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade, the AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and small, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent described the database, which includes a trove of names, chemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and surveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence on Asian drug trafficking groups in the region. The AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai’s phones with the database. They discovered photos related to three big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in China, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators and Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese anti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and addresses in Cai’s phones to other meth busts in China. For regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations upended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by different crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the work of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics agent said they believed Cai was “one of the members of a mega-syndicate,” which had been involved in multiple “drugs cases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.” Cai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still in jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking charges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to contact Cai’s lawyer.  METH PARADISE During his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing the country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and obtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a bigger vessel in international waters, according to police and the Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures of the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where the meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat. The police reconstruction of Cai’s dealings in Myanmar led to another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production had shifted from China’s southern provinces to Shan State in Myanmar’s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had provided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor ingredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were smuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the freedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement. Armed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan State have long controlled large tracts of territory and used drug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the military. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar government with rebel groups over the years has brought relative calm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to flourish. “Production facilities can be hidden from law enforcement and other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,” analyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the International Crisis Group. “Drug production and profits are now so vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.” The Myanmar government and police did not respond to questions from Reuters. Along the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there is evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts a deep ravine known as the “Valley of Death,” where ethnic Kachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for decades with Myanmar’s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past trucks carrying building materials and workers. The Kaung Kha militia’s immaculate and expansive new headquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green hills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers away, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved out of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned out vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba tablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine. When it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more than 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg of caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances used in drug production. The Loikan facility was “very likely” to have been the source of much of the Sam Gor syndicate’s meth, said the Yangon-based AFP officer. “Some militia were involved in the lab,” said Oi Khun, a communications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia, in an interview. He paused, then added: “But not with the knowledge of senior members” of the militia. One person in Loikan described how workers from the lab would come down from the hills. The men, like most of the villagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the locals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them. “I asked them once. ‘Why don’t you bathe?’” the person said. “They said they did, but there was nothing they could do about the smell.” The rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the skin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature stench might reveal their illicit activities. “We all knew,” the person said. “We just didn’t talk about it. That just brings you danger.” Meth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals, say Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network’s couriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the Asia-Pacific. Shan’s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the world, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told Reuters. “They can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the ground and let it dry.” The UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth is worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business model for meth is “very different” to heroin, said the UNODC’s Douglas. “Inputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not needed, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore far, far higher.” The wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in northeastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a UNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control Commission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to the UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand, $298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the Japanese market, that’s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up. The money the syndicate is making “means that if they lose ten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,” said the Chinese counter-narcotics official. “They can afford failure. It doesn’t matter.”  ‘MONEY, MONEY’ The analysis of Cai’s phones was continuing to provide leads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the pick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with Myanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at sea for weeks. One of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the Shun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement document reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea when, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a marine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and paid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV Valkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s and hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea sickness tablets. According to local media, he didn’t have a fishing license at the time. After buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on a course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in the Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the rendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western Australian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was seen “unloading a lot of packages” into a van, the commander said. “We knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of organized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and comes back with some gear on it, that it hasn’t just dropped from the sky in the middle of the ocean.” Investigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car hire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug traffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say, that some of Smith’s alleged co-conspirators were members of an ethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and Comanchero motorcycle gangs, known as “bikies” in Australia. As they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of crystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor syndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy of an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians reconvened in Perth a month later. Bikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and a self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had refined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star hotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police investigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants, said the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth. The restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that included caviar with toast at about $185 per serving. On November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again, this time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the Andaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth from Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the Indian Ocean. The Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened. When the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in international waters off the West Australian coast on December 19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting “money, money,” according to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De Man’s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith and his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved their identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by the crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth. The Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of Geraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The men unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of the AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault weapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty to importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of his alleged associates are still on trial. Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it had “worked together with our counterparts on the investigation” of the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the “substantial seizure of illicit narcotics” by the Australian authorities in December 2017. The bureau said it was “aware that Taiwanese syndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in (the) Asia-Pacific region,” and was working “collaboratively and closely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and cross-border drug trafficking.”  NIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED As the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police concluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone a kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the three biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the 1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The other two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse’s original triad, and the Bamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator, the syndicate’s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that it “must rival Apple’s.” “The syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market to tap,” said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior colonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade. “The power this network possesses is unimaginable.” Investigators have had wins. In February last year, police busted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough tea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66 was intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than one tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor lieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar. In December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected syndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand. Located near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed compound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used to experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a 100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to the back of the property. Sue wasn’t there, but property and money from 38 bank accounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized during the investigation. Sue is still at large. But the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the wider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal meth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and Southeast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in most countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising seizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019, “suggested the supply of the drug had expanded.” In the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive adversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug motherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product in shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth coming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the syndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This included deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each containing about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on narrow jungle paths. Over the years, police have had little success in taking down Asia’s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders have been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to the AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics kingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than a short period was in the mid-1970s. That’s when Ng Sik-ho, a wily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium and morphine, according to court records. So far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho’s fate. He is being tracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say counter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they believe he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed.     (Reporting by Tom Allard. Additional reporting by Reuters Staff.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N26Z0XS	(For more Reuters Special Reports, click on) By Tom Allard BANGKOK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - He is Asia’s most-wanted man. He is protected by a guard of Thai kickboxers. He flies by private jet. And, police say, he once lost $66 million in a single night at a Macau casino. Tse Chi Lop, a Canadian national born in China, is suspected of leading a vast multinational drug trafficking syndicate formed out of an alliance of five of Asia’s triad groups, according to law enforcement officials. Its members call it simply “The Company.” Police, in a nod to one of Tse’s nicknames, have dubbed it Sam Gor, Cantonese for “Brother Number Three.” The syndicate, law enforcers believe, is funneling tonnes of methamphetamine, heroin and ketamine to at least a dozen countries from Japan in North Asia to New Zealand in the South Pacific. But meth – a highly addictive drug with devastating physical and mental effects on long-term users – is its main business, they say. In what it calls a conservative estimate, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) puts the Sam Gor syndicate’s meth revenue in 2018 at $8 billion a year, but says it could be as high as $17.7 billion. The UN agency estimates that the cartel, which often conceals its drugs in packets of tea, has a 40% to 70% share of the wholesale regional meth market that has expanded at least fourfold in the past five years. This unprecedented boom in meth production has triggered an unprecedented response, Reuters has learned. Tse, 55, is the prime target of Operation Kungur, a sprawling, previously unreported counter-narcotics investigation. Led by the Australian Federal Police (AFP), Operation Kungur involves about 20 agencies from Asia, North America and Europe. It is by far the biggest ever international effort to combat Asian drug trafficking syndicates, say law enforcement agents involved in the investigation. It encompasses authorities from Myanmar, China, Thailand, Japan, the United States and Canada. Taiwan, while not formally part of the operation, is assisting in the investigation. A document containing AFP profiles of the operation’s top 19 syndicate targets, reviewed by Reuters, identifies Tse as the leader of the syndicate. According to the document, the organization has “been connected with or directly involved in at least 13 cases” of drug trafficking since January 2015. The document does not provide specific details of the cases. A Taiwanese law enforcement flow chart identifies Tse as the “Multinational CEO” of the syndicate. A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) intelligence document shared with regional government agencies says Tse is “believed to be” the leader of the Sam Gor syndicate. Police have not publicly identified Tse as the suspected boss of the trafficking group. Some investigators say that the scope of the syndicate’s operation puts Tse, as the suspected leader, on par with Latin America’s most legendary narco-traffickers. “Tse Chi Lop is in the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,” said Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for UNODC. “The word kingpin often gets thrown around, but there is no doubt it applies here.” Reuters was unable to contact Tse Chi Lop. In response to questions from Reuters, the AFP, the DEA and Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said they would not comment on investigations. During the past year, Reuters crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific to uncover the story of Tse and his Sam Gor network. This included interviews with more than two dozen law enforcement officials from eight countries, and reviews of intelligence reports from police and anti-narcotics agencies, court filings and other documents. Reuters spoke to militia leaders in Myanmar’s Shan State, the heart of Southeast Asia’s Golden Triangle, where the syndicate is suspected of mass producing drugs in so-called super-labs. Reuters reporters also visited the Thai compound of one of the syndicate’s alleged drug lords. What emerges is a portrait of an organization that is truly transnational. Four of the 19 Sam Gor syndicate leaders on the AFP list are Canadian citizens, including Tse, whom police often refer to as “T1” - the top target. Others hail from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and mainland China. The syndicate is enormously wealthy, disciplined and sophisticated - in many ways more sophisticated than any Latin American cartel, say anti-narcotics officials. Sam Gor supplies a bigger, more dispersed drug market and collaborates with a more diverse range of local crime groups than the Latin cartels do, including Japan’s Yakuza, Australia's biker gangs and ethnic Chinese gangs across Southeast Asia. The crime network is also less prone to uncontrolled outbreaks of internecine violence than the Latin cartels, police say. The money is so big that long-standing, blood-soaked rivalries among Asian crime groups have been set aside in a united pursuit of gargantuan profits. “The crime groups in Southeast Asia and the Far East operate with seamless efficiency,” says one veteran Western anti-drugs official. “They function like a global corporation.” Like most of the law enforcement agents Reuters interviewed, the investigator spoke on condition of anonymity. In addition to the contrasts between their drug operations, there’s another, more personal, difference between Tse Chi Lop and Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman or Pablo Escobar. The jailed Mexican cartel boss and the deceased Colombian cocaine trafficker have been feted in song and on screen for their extravagant lifestyles and extreme violence. Precious little has been revealed about Tse’s life and career. Unlike the Latin drug lords, Tse is relatively discreet - and still free.  A TRIP, A TRAP Tse Chi Lop was born in Guangdong Province, in southern China, and grew up during China’s Cultural Revolution. Amid the bloody purges, forced labor camps and mass starvation, a group of imprisoned members of Mao’s Red Guard in the southern city of Guangzhou formed a triad-like criminal enterprise called the Big Circle Gang. Tse later became a member of the group, say police, and like many of his Big Circle Gang brethren moved to Hong Kong, then further afield as they sought sanctuaries for their criminal activities. He arrived in Canada in 1988. In the 1990s, Tse shuttled between North America, Hong Kong, Macau and Southeast Asia, said a senior AFP investigator based in Asia. He rose to become a mid-ranking member of a smuggling ring that sourced heroin from the Golden Triangle, the lawless opium-producing region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand, China and Laos meet. In 1998, according to court records, Tse was arraigned on drug-trafficking charges in the Eastern District Court of New York. He was found guilty of conspiracy to import heroin into America, the records show. A potential life sentence hung over his head. Through a petition filed by his lawyer in 2000, Tse begged for leniency. His ailing parents needed constant care, he explained. His 12-year-old son had a lung disorder. His wife was overwhelmed. If freed, vowed Tse, he would open a restaurant. He expressed “great sorrow” for his crime, court records show. The entreaties appear to have worked: Tse was sentenced to nine years in prison, spent mostly at the federal correctional institution in Elkton, Ohio. But his remorse may have waned. After he was freed in 2006, police say he returned to Canada, where he was supposed to be under supervised release for the next four years. It’s unclear when Tse returned to his old haunts in Asia. But corporate records show that Tse and his wife registered a business, the China Peace Investment Group Company Ltd, in Hong Kong in 2011. Police suspect Tse quickly returned to the drug game. He “picked up where he left off,” said the senior AFP investigator. Tse tapped connections in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and the Golden Triangle, and adopted a business model that proved irresistible to his customers, say law enforcers. If one of his drug deliveries was intercepted by police, it was replaced at no extra cost, or deposits were returned to the buyers. His policy of guaranteeing his drug deliveries was good for business, but it also put him on the radar of police. In 2011, AFP officers cracked a group in Melbourne importing heroin and meth. The amounts were not huge - dozens of kilos. So, rather than arrest the Australian drug dealers, police put them under surveillance, tapping their phones and observing them closely for more than a year. To the frustration of the Australian drug cell, their illicit product kept getting intercepted. They wanted the seized drugs replaced by the syndicate.

On one occasion, he stayed at a resort in Thailand for a month, hosting visitors poolside in shorts and a T-shirt, according to a member of the task force investigating the syndicate. Tse was a frequent visitor to Asia’s casinos and fond of betting on horses, especially on English races. “We believe he lost 60 million euros (about $66 million) in one night on the tables in Macau,” said the senior Asia-based AFP investigator. As the investigation into Tse deepened, police suspected that the Canadian was the major trafficker supplying Australia with meth and heroin, with a lucrative sideline in MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy. But the true scale and breadth of the Sam Gor syndicate only became apparent in late 2016, police say, when a young Taiwanese man entered Yangon airport with a bag of white powder strapped to each of his thighs.  ‘ALADDIN’S CAVE OF INTEL’ Cai Jeng Ze was heading home to Taiwan, walking through the airport with a Jimmy Choo leather bag and two mobile phones. It was the morning of November 15, 2016, and Cai seemed nervous, picking at his blistered hands. This tic aroused suspicion, said a former Myanmar police commander who oversaw the investigation. “His hands were bad because he had been handling the drugs,” the commander told Reuters. “Methamphetamine is very toxic.” Cai was stopped and searched. Taped to each of his thighs was a small bag containing 80 grams of ketamine, a powerful tranquilizer that doubles as a party drug. “We were very fortunate to arrest him. Actually, it was an accident,” the commander said. Myanmar police, tipped off by the DEA, had been monitoring Cai. But they had lost track of him. Airport police had no idea who he was. Cai told airport police the bag on his thigh contained a “pesticide or vitamin for flowers and plants,” according to Myanmar court records from his trial for ketamine trafficking. A friend, said Cai, had given it to him to pass on to his father. Cai’s flight was about to leave and there was no drug test for ketamine at the airport, the commander said. Unimpressed with the explanation, police held him overnight. The next day, anti-narcotic officers turned up at the airport. One recognized him from surveillance work he’d been conducting. Still, Cai refused to talk. Police say that videos they later found on one of his phones might have explained his silence. The videos showed a crying and bound man, and at least three assailants taking turns burning his feet with a blowtorch and electrocuting him with a cattle prod. In the videos, said one investigator, a sign can be seen with Chinese calligraphy saying “Loyalty to the Heavens.” The banner was a “triad-related sign,” he added. The tortured man, according to two AFP officers who viewed the video, claimed to have thrown 300 kg of meth from a boat because he mistakenly believed a fast-approaching vessel was a law enforcement boat. The torturers were testing the veracity of the victim’s claims. By filming and sharing the videos, triad members were sending a message about the price of disloyalty, the officers said. Reuters has not seen the video. The torture videos were just one of the items allegedly found in Cai’s two iPhones. The alleged Taiwanese trafficker was a diligent chronicler of the drug syndicate’s activities, but sloppy when it came to information security. Inside the phones, police say, was a huge photo and video gallery, social media conversations, and logs of thousands of calls and text messages. They were “an Aladdin’s Cave of intel,” said one AFP commander based in North Asia. For at least two months prior to his arrest, Cai allegedly travelled around Myanmar cobbling together a huge meth deal for the syndicate, according to a PowerPoint presentation by the Drug Enforcement Division of the Myanmar police outlining its investigation. One telling discovery: a screenshot of a slip from an international courier company recording the delivery of two consignments of packaging, manufactured to hold loose-leaf Chinese tea, to a Yangon address. Since at least 2012, tea packets, often containing one kilo of crystal meth each, had been cropping up in drug busts across the Asia-Pacific region. Two days after Cai’s arrest, Myanmar police raided a Yangon address, where they seized 622 kilograms of ketamine. That evening, they captured 1.1 tonnes of crystal meth at a Yangon jetty. The interception of the drugs was a coup. Even so, Myanmar police were frustrated. Nine people were arrested, but other than Cai they were lower-level members of the syndicate, including couriers and a driver. And Cai still wasn't talking. Then came a major breakthrough. Swiping through the gallery of photos and videos on Cai’s phones, an AFP investigator based in Yangon noticed a familiar face from an intelligence briefing he had attended on Asian drug traffickers about a year earlier. “This one stuck out because it was Canadian,” he recalled. “I said: ‘Fuck, I know who you are!'” It was Tse Chi Lop. The Myanmar police invited the AFP to send a team of intelligence analysts to Yangon in early 2017. They went to work on Cai’s phones. Australia had been a profitable drug market for Asian crime gangs since the end of the Vietnam War. For at least a decade, the AFP had fed all its historic files on drug cases, large and small, into a database. A senior Chinese counter-narcotics agent described the database, which includes a trove of names, chemical signatures of seized drugs, phone metadata and surveillance intel, as the most impressive cache of intelligence on Asian drug trafficking groups in the region. The AFP analysts cross-referenced the contents of Cai’s phones with the database. They discovered photos related to three big consignments of crystal meth that were intercepted in China, Japan and New Zealand in 2016, according to investigators and Myanmar police documents. Later, a team of Chinese anti-narcotics officials connected photos, telephone numbers and addresses in Cai’s phones to other meth busts in China. For regional counter-narcotics police, the revelations upended their assumption that the drugs were being trafficked by different crime groups. It became clear the shipments were the work of just one organization. A senior Chinese anti-narcotics agent said they believed Cai was “one of the members of a mega-syndicate,” which had been involved in multiple “drugs cases, smuggling and manufacturing, within this region.” Cai was found not guilty in the ketamine case, but is still in jail in Yangon, where he is on trial for drug trafficking charges related to the meth seizures. Reuters was unable to contact Cai’s lawyer.  METH PARADISE During his time in Myanmar, Cai is suspected of traversing the country, testing drug samples, organizing couriers and obtaining a fishing boat to transport the illicit cargo to a bigger vessel in international waters, according to police and the Myanmar PowerPoint document. His phones contained pictures of the vehicles to be used to transport the meth, the spot where the meth was to be dropped off, and the fishing boat. The police reconstruction of Cai’s dealings in Myanmar led to another major revelation: The epicenter of meth production had shifted from China’s southern provinces to Shan State in Myanmar’s northeastern borderlands. Operating in China had provided the Sam Gor syndicate with easy access to precursor ingredients, such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that were smuggled out of pharmaceutical, chemical and paint factories in the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Shan gave Sam Gor the freedom to operate largely unimpeded by law enforcement. Armed rebel groups in semi-autonomous regions like Shan State have long controlled large tracts of territory and used drug revenues to finance their frequent battles with the military. A series of detentes brokered by the Myanmar government with rebel groups over the years has brought relative calm to the region - and allowed illicit drug activities to flourish. “Production facilities can be hidden from law enforcement and other prying eyes but insulated from disruptive violence,” analyst Richard Horsey wrote in a paper this year for the International Crisis Group. “Drug production and profits are now so vast that they dwarf the formal sector of Shan state.” The Myanmar government and police did not respond to questions from Reuters. Along the road to the village of Loikan in Shan State, there is evidence of drug-fueled prosperity. The two-lane road skirts a deep ravine known as the “Valley of Death,” where ethnic Kachin rebels from the Kaung Kha paramilitary group clashed for decades with Myanmar’s army. Now, high-end SUVs thunder past trucks carrying building materials and workers. The Kaung Kha militia’s immaculate and expansive new headquarters sits on a plateau nestled between the steep green hills of the jagged Loi Sam Sip range. About six kilometers away, near Loikan village, was a sprawling drug facility carved out of thick forest. Police and locals say the complex churned out vast quantities of crystal meth, heroin, ketamine and yaba tablets - a cheaper form of meth that is mixed with caffeine. When it was raided in early 2018, security forces seized more than 200,000 liters of precursor chemicals, as well as 10,000 kg of caffeine and 73,550 kg of sodium hydroxide - all substances used in drug production. The Loikan facility was “very likely” to have been the source of much of the Sam Gor syndicate’s meth, said the Yangon-based AFP officer. “Some militia were involved in the lab,” said Oi Khun, a communications officer for the 3,000-strong Kaung Kha militia, in an interview. He paused, then added: “But not with the knowledge of senior members” of the militia. One person in Loikan described how workers from the lab would come down from the hills. The men, like most of the villagers, were ethnic Chinese. But they dressed better than the locals, had foreign accents, and had a foul smell about them. “I asked them once. ‘Why don’t you bathe?’” the person said. “They said they did, but there was nothing they could do about the smell.” The rank chemicals used to cook the meth had seeped into the skin of the men, who seemed unperturbed that the signature stench might reveal their illicit activities. “We all knew,” the person said. “We just didn’t talk about it. That just brings you danger.” Meth lab managers and chemists are mostly Taiwan nationals, say Thai police. So, too, are many of the crime network’s couriers and boat crews who transport the drugs across the Asia-Pacific. Shan’s super-labs produce the purest crystal meth in the world, the senior Chinese counter-narcotics official told Reuters. “They can take it slow and spread (the meth) out on the ground and let it dry.” The UNODC estimates the Asia-Pacific retail market for meth is worth between $30.3 and $61.4 billion annually. The business model for meth is “very different” to heroin, said the UNODC’s Douglas. “Inputs are relatively cheap, a large workforce is not needed, the price per kilo is higher, and profits are therefore far, far higher.” The wholesale price of a kilo of crystal meth produced in northeastern Myanmar is as little as $1,800, according to a UNODC report citing the China National Narcotics Control Commission. Average retail prices for crystal meth, according to the UN agency, are equivalent to $70,500 per kilo in Thailand, $298,000 per kilo in Australia and $588,000 in Japan. For the Japanese market, that’s more than a three-hundred-fold mark-up. The money the syndicate is making “means that if they lose ten tonnes and one goes through, they still make a big profit,” said the Chinese counter-narcotics official. “They can afford failure. It doesn’t matter.”  ‘MONEY, MONEY’ The analysis of Cai’s phones was continuing to provide leads. On them, police say they found the GPS coordinates of the pick-up point in the Andaman Sea where fishing boats laden with Myanmar meth were meeting drug motherships capable of being at sea for weeks. One of the motherships was a Taiwanese trawler called the Shun de Man 66, according to the Taiwanese law enforcement document reviewed by Reuters. The vessel was already at sea when, in early July 2017, Joshua Joseph Smith walked into a marine broker in the Western Australian capital of Perth and paid $A350,000 (about $265,000 at the time) for the MV Valkoista, a fishing charter boat. Smith, who was in his mid-40s and hailed from the east coast of Australia, inquired about sea sickness tablets. According to local media, he didn’t have a fishing license at the time. After buying the boat on July 7, Smith set the Valkoista on a course straight from the marina to meet the Shun De Man 66 in the Indian Ocean, an AFP police commander said. After the rendezvous, the Valkoista then sailed to the remote Western Australian port city of Geraldton on July 11, where its crew was seen “unloading a lot of packages” into a van, the commander said. “We knew we had an importation. We know the methodology of organized crime networks. We know if a ship leaves empty and comes back with some gear on it, that it hasn’t just dropped from the sky in the middle of the ocean.” Investigators checked CCTV footage and hotel, plane and car hire records. The phones of some of the Australian drug traffickers were tapped. It soon became apparent, police say, that some of Smith’s alleged co-conspirators were members of an ethnic Lebanese underworld gang, as well as the Hells Angels and Comanchero motorcycle gangs, known as “bikies” in Australia. As they put together their deal to import 1.2 tonnes of crystal meth into Australia, Smith's associates met with Sam Gor syndicate members in Bangkok in August 2017, according to a copy of an AFP document reviewed by Reuters. The Australians reconvened in Perth a month later. Bikers may have a reputation for wild clubhouse parties and a self-styled mythology as outsiders, but these Australians had refined tastes. They flew business class, stayed in five-star hotels and dined at the finest restaurants, according to police investigators and local media reports. One of those restaurants, said the AFP commander, was the Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth. The restaurant offered a 104-page wine list and a menu that included caviar with toast at about $185 per serving. On November 27, 2017, the Shun De Man 66 set sail again, this time from Singapore. The vessel headed north into the Andaman Sea to rendezvous with a smaller boat bringing the meth from Myanmar. The Shun De Man then sailed along the west coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and dropped down to the Indian Ocean. The Indonesian navy watched and the AFP listened. When the Shun De Man finally met again with the Valkoista in international waters off the West Australian coast on December 19, an Asian voice could be heard shouting “money, money,” according to the commander and local media reports. The Shun De Man’s crew had one half of a torn Hong Kong dollar bill. Smith and his crew had the other half. The Australian buyers proved their identity by matching their portion to the fragment held by the crew of the Shun De Man, who then handed over the meth. The Valkoista arrived in the Australian port city of Geraldton following a two-day return journey in rough seas. The men unloaded the drugs in the pre-dawn dark. Masked members of the AFP and Western Australian police moved in with assault weapons and seized the drugs and the men. Smith pleaded guilty to importing a commercial quantity of an illegal drug. Some of his alleged associates are still on trial. Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said it had “worked together with our counterparts on the investigation” of the Shun De Man 66 and that this had led to the “substantial seizure of illicit narcotics” by the Australian authorities in December 2017. The bureau said it was “aware that Taiwanese syndicates have participated in maritime drug trafficking in (the) Asia-Pacific region,” and was working “collaboratively and closely with our counterparts to disrupt these syndicates and cross-border drug trafficking.”  NIMBLE, ELUSIVE, UNFAZED As the investigation into the syndicate deepened, police concluded that crime groups from across the region had undergone a kind of mega-merger to form Sam Gor. The members include the three biggest Hong Kong and Macau triads, who spent much of the 1990s in open warfare: 14K, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On. The other two are the Big Circle Gang, Tse’s original triad, and the Bamboo Union, based in Taiwan. In the words of one investigator, the syndicate’s supply chain is so complex and expertly run that it “must rival Apple’s.” “The syndicate has a lot of money and there is a vast market to tap,” said Jay Li Chien-chih, a Taiwanese police senior colonel who has been stationed in Southeast Asia for a decade. “The power this network possesses is unimaginable.” Investigators have had wins. In February last year, police busted the Loikan super-lab in Myanmar, where they found enough tea-branded packaging for 10 tonnes of meth. The Shun De Man 66 was intercepted that month by the Indonesian navy with more than one tonne of meth aboard. In March 2018, a key Sam Gor lieutenant was arrested in Cambodia and extradited to Myanmar. In December, the compound of Sue Songkittikul, a suspected syndicate operations chief, was raided in Thailand. Located near the border with Myanmar, the moat-ringed compound had a small meth lab, which police suspected was used to experiment with new recipes; a powerful radio tower with a 100-km range; and an underground tunnel from the main house to the back of the property. Sue wasn’t there, but property and money from 38 bank accounts linked to him and totaling some $9 million were seized during the investigation. Sue is still at large. But the flow of drugs leaving the Golden Triangle for the wider Asia-Pacific seems to have increased. Seizures of crystal meth and yaba rose about 50% last year to 126 tonnes in East and Southeast Asia. At the same time, prices for the drugs fell in most countries. This pattern of falling prices and rising seizures, the UNODC said in a report released in March 2019, “suggested the supply of the drug had expanded.” In the Sam Gor syndicate, police face a nimble and elusive adversary. When authorities had success stopping the drug motherships, police said, Sam Gor switched to hiding its product in shipping containers. When Thailand stopped much of the meth coming directly across the border from Myanmar by truck, the syndicate re-routed deliveries through Laos and Vietnam. This included deploying hordes of Laotians with backpacks, each containing about 30 kilos of meth, to carry it into Thailand on narrow jungle paths. Over the years, police have had little success in taking down Asia’s drug lords. Some of the suspected syndicate leaders have been involved in drug trafficking for decades, according to the AFP target list. The last time a top-level Asian narcotics kingpin was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for more than a short period was in the mid-1970s. That’s when Ng Sik-ho, a wily Hong Kong drug trafficker known as Limpy Ho, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for smuggling more than 20 tonnes of opium and morphine, according to court records. So far, Tse has avoided Limpy Ho’s fate. He is being tracked, and all the signs are he knows it, say counter-narcotics agents. Despite the heat, some police say they believe he is continuing his drug operations, unfazed. (Reporting by Tom Allard. Additional reporting by Reuters Staff.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N26W2R0	"By Thin Lei Win ROME, Oct 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Farmers around the world are losing up to 20% of the food they produce every year but action can be taken to reduce this, according to the United Nations on Monday as it quantified such losses for the first time. A combination of causes, ranging from harvesting and handling practices, to lack of infrastructure and market prices to pests, diseases and climatic conditions, contributed to these losses, said the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). This ""means that land and water resources have been wasted, pollution created and greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted to no purpose"", said FAO Director-General Qu Dongyu in a report released ahead of World Food Day on Oct. 16. An earlier, widely-cited figure estimated about a third of the world's food - about 1.3 billion tonnes - was lost or wasted annually but that was a rough figure including estimates for losses along the whole supply chain, according to the FAO. The FAO said the latest numbers, which showed 14% losses globally, focused on losses between harvest and markets and showed variations among the world's regions and commodities. Central and southern Asia have the highest level of food losses of 20% followed by northern America and Europe at more than 15%. Australia and New Zealand have the lowest at about 6%. ""This number is important because now we can measure the effects of different policies to reduce losses and we can track it over time to see if we're improving or not,"" said the FAO's Assistant Director-General Maximo Torero Cullen. With the right policies the world ""can eliminate a significant amount of that 14% food loss"" but this had costs and depended on lawmakers, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""Reductions in the early stages of the food supply chain is most effective in addressing food security or natural resources stress, but reduction of food waste by consumers and retailers is the best to reduce GHG emissions,"" he added. The findings show losses of one in four roots, tubers and oil-bearing crops, such as cassava and potatoes, and more than one in five fruits and vegetables, but less than 10% in cereals and pulses. Slashing these losses on the farm could increase food availability for small-scale farmers in low-income countries who might also make money selling the surplus, but a glut in produce could depress prices as well as demand, the report warned. Also some losses were easier to address than others. Making air-conditioned storage available in rural locations without proper roads or electricity would take time but others might only require small adjustments, Torero Cullen said. For example in Ghana, switching from conventional bags to triple-layer bags with an air-tight seal can protect cassava chips and maize from insects and fungus, according to Washington-based International Food Policy Research Institute. New technologies could also help. California-based start-up Apeel Sciences produces a plant-based coating that comes in powder form and, when applied with water, can double the shelf life of fruits and vegetables without refrigeration. It is being tested on mangoes and cassava in Africa. ""Our hope is that with better information and better quality data, we can accelerate this process of reducing food loss,"" said Torero Cullen. ""This is a big step towards action.""

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N26Z1TR	"HONG KONG, Oct 14 (Reuters) - South Korea coach Paulo Bento has told his players to be wary of a counter-attacking North Korean side ahead of Tuesday's historic meeting in Pyongyang in 2022 World Cup qualifying. The two Koreas are still technically at war after the 1950-53 Korean war ended with a truce rather than a peace treaty. Their national football teams have faced off before in World Cup qualifying, with their last meeting coming in 2009, but Tuesday's game will be the first time the countries will have met in the competition in Pyongyang. It will also mark the first time the men's national teams have played in the North's capital since a friendly in October 1990. ""North Korea are a physical and aggressive team, and they can be especially dangerous on counter-attacks,"" Yonhap news agency quoted Bento as saying. ""But North Korea also have holes that we can exploit, and I think we're prepared to do just that."" Both teams have won their opening two games in the second round of qualifying for the World Cup in Qatar, with South Korea notching up an 8-0 win over Sri Lanka on Thursday having already defeated Turkmenistan. North Korea, meanwhile, beat Lebanon in Pyongyang in their opening game of the campaign before securing a narrow victory over the Sri Lankans to stand level on six points with their neighbours. ""Our players are well prepared, and the team atmosphere is great,"" said the coach. ""Above all, our players are in great physical condition. The most important thing for us is to have everyone healthy before going on the road."" Fans in South Korea will not be able to watch Tuesday's game, however, after broadcasters failed to agree a deal with North Korean authorities to show the match live. This is the second World Cup qualifying campaign in the last decade that the two nations have been drawn to face one another. South and North Korea met in the third and fourth rounds of qualifying for the 2010 World Cup, with the two games due to be played in North Korea relocated to Shanghai. Across their four meetings in 2008 and 2009, three were drawn - including both games played at Shanghai's Hongkou Stadium - with South Korea winning the second meeting in Seoul 1-0 as both nations qualified for the Finals in South Africa. That remains the only time both countries have progressed to the finals of the same World Cup.

Xi and Modi held nearly six hours of talks in an Indian seaside town in their second annual summit designed to break through decades of distrust over border disputes, trade rows and China's close military ties with India's arch rival, Pakistan. Relations were ruffled further in August when India revoked the special status of the Himalayan territory of Kashmir, angering both Pakistan, which claims the region, and its all-weather ally China. But the question of Kashmir was not discussed during Saturday's summit and instead issues of trade and investment were taken up, Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale said. China, embroiled in a bruising trade war with the United States, was quite appreciative of the imbalance in its own trade with India and willing to address it, Gokhale told reporters. ""There was a good conversation on trade, an issue of concern; President Xi said China is ready to take sincere action in this regard and discuss in a concrete way how to reduce the deficit,"" he said. Bilateral trade between China and India reached $95.54 billion in 2018, with the trade deficit at $53 billion in China’s favour, the biggest India has with any country. ""One of the understandings the two leaders reached was that a new mechanism will be established to discuss trade, investment and services,"" Gokhale said. The high-level group will be led by Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Chinese Vice Premier Hu Chunhua. Indian generic drugmakers have long sought greater market access to China, as have India's IT services. Xi said both were welcome. China, for its part, has been urging India to take an independent decision on telecom equipment maker Huawei’s bid for India’s proposed 3G network and not be swayed by U.S. pressure. The United States has asked its allies not to use Huawei equipment, which it says China could exploit for espionage. Beijing denies this accusation. In his opening remarks, Xi said he had a free and frank discussion with Modi and would pursue proposals the two leaders discussed to improve bilateral ties. ""Yesterday and today we have engaged in candid discussions and as friends,"" Xi said. ""I look forward to further discussions, I may follow up on proposals discussed yesterday."" Xi did not elaborate.  PERSONAL WARMTH In Mamallapuram in southern India, Modi took Xi on a personal tour of temple monuments dating back to the seventh and eighth centuries when Indian kingdoms cultivated trade ties with Chinese provinces. Modi noted in his opening remarks that he and Xi had agreed at a previous summit to manage their differences prudently and not let them snowball into disputes. India and China share a 3,500-km (2,200-mile) border, over which they went to war in 1962. The course of the frontier remains unresolved despite more than 20 rounds of talks. Xi also suggested the two sides expand cooperation in the military sector to boost trust. Xi headed to Nepal later on Saturday where he is expected to push for further Chinese involvement in developing its infrastructure as part of Beijing's signature Belt and Road Initiative to boost trade and transport links across Asia. India has refused to join the BRI because a part of it runs through Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, which India claims as its territory. It has also said that the infrastructure projects must be tailored for the benefit of the host country and not drive them into debt, which has occurred in the case of the small island nations of Sri Lanka and Maldives.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26W34A	"By Umberto Bacchi COPENHAGEN, Oct 11 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Young activists demonstrating across the world are driving cities to step up action on climate change, not least because politicians keep coming face-to-face with them while going about their business, mayors at a climate conference heard Friday. As activists from Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg to ""Extinction Rebellion"" movement protesters take an increasingly visible stand on climate change, officials feel growing pressure to respond, mayors gathered in Copenhagen said. ""If you want to walk the streets of some of the biggest cities in Poland, you've got to do something about climate change,"" Warsaw's mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski, told the C40 summit of mayors committed to action on climate change. ""The pressure especially from young people is just enormous,"" he said. ""They are fed up with declarations, with goals and priorities ... they want to see results"". Leaders of more than 90 cities representing more than 700 million people and a quarter of the global economy met in the Danish capital this week to push for faster action to stem climate threats. The gathering came as Extinction Rebellion climate change activists took to the streets from London to New Zealand for two weeks of peaceful civil disobedience. ""Mayors are on the frontline now,"" former U.S. vice president Al Gore told the conference. ""You do not have the luxury of just going away and reading reports about what is going on. You run into your constituents every single day."" On Thursday Extinction Rebellion protesters attempted to shut down London City Airport, with one protester laying on top of a plane. On Friday they blocked the headquarters of the BBC, Britain's public service broadcaster.. Earlier this week, French members of the movement blocked a street and bridge in Paris' Chatelet district. The city's mayor, Anne Hidalgo, said she shared their concern. ""We are facing threats of climate breakdown – the response that we're seeing from Extinction Rebellion and young climate strikers around the globe should come as no surprise,"" she said. In Copenhagen, city leaders unveiled a series of pledges and measures to cut planet warming emissions, from reducing meat consumption to tackling air pollution with cheap bus fares and vehicle bans. But delegates at the summit opening Wednesday were met by demonstrators from Klima Aktion DK, a local climate action group, armed with fake binoculars made from toilet rolls. ""Our message to the C40 Mayors is: The people are watching you! We want to see action!"" the group wrote on Facebook.  EMPTY WORDS Cities are vital to limit global warming as they account for about three-quarters of carbon emissions and consume more than two-thirds of global energy, according to the United Nations. Wider use of existing clean technologies - such as electric buses - could deliver more than half the cuts needed to keep global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the U.N. says. World leaders agreed in the 2015 Paris Agreement to hold temperate hikes to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius. ""Cities are where the climate battle will largely be won or lost,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the Copenhagen summit. Youth activists invited to the meeting to discuss possible climate measures demanded a bigger seat at the table and called for stronger action. ""We should be a part of the decision process when decisions regarding our future are being taken,"" said Selma Norgard, a young Danish climate activist. Luisa Neubauer, a founder of the German branch of Fridays for Future, the movement started by Thunberg, said her 10 months of activism on climate change had taught her to distrust politicians. ""We have become experts in listening to empty words and to hearing empty promises over and over again. That is painful,"" she said. ""We just ask to grow old on a planet that can provide livelihoods for all of us, no matter where we are born"". Hilda Nakabuye, the founder of Fridays for Future in Uganda, said her family had been forced to sell of its land and livestock as heavy rains, high winds and dry spells linked to climate change had wiped away crops and made the soil barren. ""Your beds might be comfortable right now but not for long. You'll soon feel the same heat that we feel every day,"" she warned.  NO MAGIC WAND Many mayors in attendance said they were inspired by the resolve shown by young activists - and somewhat surprised by the rapid growth of their movement. Milan's mayor, Giuseppe Sala, said the city council was planning to consult young people in climate matters. But translating ideas into concrete action was not always easy, as not everybody agrees on what should be done, said the mayor of Lisbon, Fernando Medina. Even simple measures such as creating more cycle lanes often face opposition from residents and politicians when, for example, they encroach on parking spaces, he said. ""I don't have a magic wand,"" he said. ""But I can tell (young people) that I can work every day to make things happen more quickly"". Others lamented that cities alone could not solve the climate crisis. ""Cities are leading the change, but countries need to do their part too,"" said the mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau. At least 70 countries announced plans at a U.N. climate action summit last month to boost their effors to cut emissions, but most major economies, including the United States and China, failed to announce stronger new measures. The world is now at a crossroads between ""extinction or opportunity"", said U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic member of Congress. ""Every decision we make between now and (within) our children's lifetimes will determine how human life will fare, whether we'll suffer greatly or build together,"" she told the summit.

The BBC film used an undercover reporter to expose sexual harassment at two universities in Nigeria and Ghana, sparking debate on social media about the problem of ""sex for grades"". ""Nigeria needs stricter laws to protect girls and women from abuse,"" said President Muhammadu Buhari in a tweet. ""I acknowledge that we need to do more as a country to address incidents of sexual violence and sexual abuse in our schools; and all forms of discrimination, human trafficking and cultural practices that violate women's rights,"" he added. Buhari said he welcomed amendments proposed by the National Assembly to address these issues, without giving details, and urged police and schools to take harassment cases seriously. A bill aiming to tackle violence against women and gender discrimination was also introduced in 2016, but did not pass the Senate. Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, has one of the world's lowest rates of female participation in politics and just 6% of its lawmakers are women, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union. Buhari has previously been criticized by women's rights activists for saying that his wife ""belongs in the kitchen"". The country saw protests by women earlier this year when a popular pastor was accused of rape, prompting a social media movement inspired by the #MeToo campaign that started in Hollywood. Nigerian actors have said sexual abuse is rife in Nollywood, the country's film industry, and that there are no effective laws to curb it. ""The practice of shaming and silencing victims must also be discouraged by all,"" Buhari said on Twitter. (Reporting by Nellie Peyton, Editing by Claire Cozens.

Speaking after a two-day meeting of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, Kate O'Brien, the WHO's department director, said the world ""is facing an alarming upsurge in measles cases in all regions"". ""The impact of these outbreaks is really devastating,"" she said, ""causing not only widespread loss of life, but also preventable disability that is affecting family livelihoods and national economies, and straining healthcare systems."" Latest WHO global data show that reported cases of measles - which is one of the world's most contagious diseases - rose by 300 percent globally in the first three months of this year compared to the same period in 2018. This follows consecutive increases over the past two years. There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, but it can be prevented with two doses of vaccine. The vast majority of cases of infection are in unvaccinated or under-vaccinated people. Outbreaks of the disease are causing tens of thousands of infections and thousands of deaths the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, the Philippines, Sudan, Thailand and Ukraine, among other countries, the WHO said. The SAGE experts said such outbreaks were clear indications of critical gaps in vaccination coverage and urged authorities to do more to raise rates of immunisation. Alejandro Cravioto, the group's chair, told reporters on a teleconference from the WHO's Geneva headquarters that this was ""an alarming situation"". He said latest global figures show about 86% coverage with a first measles vaccine dose and less than 70% for a second dose, ""which is one of the root causes of the problem"". ""The strategy needs to be reinforced,"" he said. ""There is no reason why we cannot try to reach every child to enable them to be fully immunised and protected against this disease.""

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26T549	"By Nellie Peyton DAKAR, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Propelled to fashion fame by Beyonce, an African clothing designer plans to expand production in Senegal and train local tailors to translate her brand's success into jobs, she said. Sarah Diouf's Tongoro designs gained an international following after the superstar wore her patterned dresses and wide-leg pants on vacation in Italy last year, causing sales to nearly triple. The 31-year-old was then asked to make a custom design for Beyonce, who wore a Tongoro suit and dressed her dancers in its jewellery in her ""Spirit"" music video for ""The Lion King"" film. R&B singer Alicia Keys and British model Naomi Campbell have also been spotted in Tongoro, whose pieces are sold online for about 200 euros ($220). But rising demand for ""Made in Africa"" fashion has not yet benefited many people at home, said Diouf, who employs only seven tailors so far. With more local training and online sales, she thinks Senegal's nascent clothing industry can grow. ""We have so much talent, but I think we just need a little bit more structure to take it to the next level,"" said Diouf in an interview in the Senegalese capital, Dakar. ""For me, the Beyonce storyline is opening the conversation and opening doors."" Diouf started her brand in 2016 after going back and forth between Dakar and Paris and realising that her friends in France were eager to buy the clothes she had made in Senegal. Dakar is known for its vibrant fashion scene but most tailors are self-taught, work on street corners and have no way to reach a wider customer base. After Tongoro was featured in Elle and Vogue magazines, Diouf recognised its potential to sell worldwide. She plans to scale up next year and eventually open a production facility with 100 to 150 tailors. ""I feel like, for so long, everything that comes from Africa has been associated with bad quality,"" she said. ""It was important for me to push that narrative forward, to say, you can actually buy something from Africa that is not cliche ... but something that can be modern and youthful."" The challenges are big. Senegalese tailors are not used to producing en masse, and selling clothes online is a relatively new idea for locals, said Diouf. If more African businesses embraced e-commerce it could be a game-changer for expanding their reach, she said. ""In Dakar there are more and more emerging brands,"" said Diouf. ""I think with the new generation, especially because we're more keen on digital, things are slowly changing."" Her biggest markets are currently Nigeria, South Africa and Ghana but she hopes to lower prices as the company grows and become an African version of Zara, the giant Spanish chain. ""To scale, I will have to invest in training. I think this is the next challenge for 'Made in Africa',"" she said. ""We have a lot of artisans with great skills and talent, but when it comes to scale we cannot afford to have one item not looking alike."" Other West African designers have recognised the same need. Sophie Sy, who recently launched the Senegalese brand BAAX, plans to open a tailoring school in Dakar next year. Diouf said she hopes the attention on her brand will lead to more respect for and investment in other African businesses too. ""It's very important for me to create an ecosystem where everyone can benefit from what I do,"" she said. ($1 = 0.9072 euros) (Reporting by Nellie Peyton; Editing by Katy Migiro.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L8N1XU098	"By Rina Chandran MUMBAI, Oct 11 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A ttic.Caramel.Truth is not a crossword puzzle. It is the address of India's most famous monument - the Taj Mahal - on a mapping app that aims to help millions of slum dwellers, rural residents, refugees and those in need of emergency aid. As smartphones become a common sight in developing nations and mapping technologies get more advanced, apps such as What3Words, CitoCode and Google's Plus Code are making it possible to locate even the world's most remote areas on a map. But it is particularly useful in a country like India, where more than a quarter of the urban population lives in informal settlements which may lack street names and house numbers, said Giles Rhys Jones, chief marketing officer at What3Words. ""The lack of a formal address can be very limiting - from difficulty in receiving post to being unable to open a bank account or vote,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from London. ""Having a uniform system is a potentially radical shift, as it enables digitisation of databases of addresses, land administration geoportals, and accurate disaster and emergency service responses,"" he said on Friday. What3Words divides the Earth into 3 metre x 3 metre squares and assigns each box a unique three-word address. It is available as a mobile app in 36 languages, including five Indian languages introduced earlier this year, with plans for more. The International Committee of the Red Cross in the Philippines uses the system in disaster zones where buildings may be flattened and roads washed away. In Mongolia, home to a large nomadic population, it is used in government documents and is recognised by many banks. In a pilot for postal services in three Indian states last year, What3Words was faster than traditional sorting methods, Jones said, adding that it would take less than five days to provide everyone in the country a three-word address. More than a billion people live in slums and informal settlements, according to the United Nations, and they are often denied government documentation and benefits because they lack a formal address. ""Accurate identification of a housing unit enables inhabitants to demand, access and pay for services such as electricity and water easily,"" said Vikram Jain, director of social consultancy FSG in Mumbai. ""Rights can be accessed when an individual can be linked to a property accurately, which allows the individual to use, transfer and inherit rights confidently,"" he said. For slum dwellers in the Indian city of Kolkata, Dublin-based non-profit Addressing the Unaddressed uses GPS navigation system coordinates to create a 10-character word code that can then be located on Google maps. ""It has the potential to help a large number of people around the world,"" said Google spokesman Dusan Farrington, referring to Plus Code.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_KBN1WP2K6	"By Veronica G Cardenas GATEWAY BRIDGE, U.S.-Mexico border (Reuters) - Migrants seeking asylum in the United States who are camped in a dangerous Mexican border town occupied a bridge to Brownsville, Texas on Thursday, leading U.S. authorities to close the crossing, witnesses and authorities said.  Hundreds of the migrants have been sleeping for weeks on the end of the bridge in Matamoros, Mexico, a city known for gang violence and for cartels that control human trafficking. Many of those living in tents or on the sidewalk in a plaza abutting the bridge are awaiting court dates for hearings in the United States weeks or months later under a U.S. policy called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP). Video shot by a Reuters photographer showed men, women and children, some lying on blankets, midway across the bridge over the Rio Grande. Dozens of U.S. border agents stood behind a gate topped with razor wire, which blocked the path into the United States. Some migrants said they were trying to cross as a group into the United States, and were frustrated that court dates kept being pushed backwards, leaving them uncertain of how long they would be stuck in Mexico. ""We want to argue to cross over - we didn't ask to be in Mexico, they sent us here unjustly,"" said a man who declined to give his name. He said he had a court date in the United States. Matamoros mayor Mario Lopez and a Mexican migration official pleaded with asylum-seekers to clear the blockage.  A Honduran man responded by indicating the lumps and rash on the throat of his young daughter, which he attributed to unhygienic conditions in the camp. He said Mexican officials encouraged those in the camp to take a government paid-for bus back to the border with Guatemala, instead of pursuing their U.S. asylum claims. He said this was not a safe option for his family. ""I'd have to go back to Honduras. And you know the news there. If we go back to Honduras, in one day, in 24 hours, we're dead."" Tens of thousands of Hondurans have fled gang violence and criminality in the country, whose murder rate ranks among the world’s highest. Elias Rodriguez, public affairs liaison for U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Brownsville, wrote in a statement that traffic on the Gateway bridge between the two cities remained closed in both directions and that Thursday's MPP immigration court hearings were being rescheduled. Rodriguez separately told Reuters there had been no violence. More than 51,000 migrants, mostly asylum seekers, have been returned to Mexico under MPP. At least 8,000 have been sent to Matamoros, a border city in crime-wracked Taumaulipas state, since the policy was expanded in July from other parts of the U.S.-Mexico border. Their sense of uncertainty comes amid news of shifting U.S. policies. The U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision last month that would allow the U.S. government to deny asylum to people who have passed through a third country, such as Mexico, and not requested refuge there first.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26V751	"(Updates Oct 9 story with fresh headline) By Noah Browning LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. military has conducted an aerial survey of Greenland to assess the vast arctic island's mineral potential as part of an agreement between the two governments, a top U.S. diplomat said on Wednesday. The memorandum of understanding for cooperating on developing the mineral sector there was inked in June before a diplomatic flap between the United States and Denmark, to which Greenland is linked as an autonomous territory. U.S. President Donald Trump called off a visit to Denmark scheduled for early September after the country's prime minister rebuffed his idea of purchasing Greenland. Frank Fannon, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for energy resources, told reporters at a gathering at London's Chatham House that the process was ""quite costly and technology intensive"" and so Greenland had sought U.S. assistance. ""We had the navy there to shoot a hyperspectral survey, to basically use overflight technology to better understand the resource endowment."" ""That creates data room where the U.S. Geological Survey would be brought in to help interpret the data and share with the Greenlanders what the potential resource endowment might be."" According to a press release by Greenland's government, the aerial mapping would be jointly funded and involves surveying around 3,000 square kilometres in the territory's southwestern Gardar province. The data gathered would measure the reflection of sunlight, including infrared light invisible to the naked eye, to better understand the geology of the terrain and its mineral content. Fannon added that the United States planned to help Greenland, armed with the data, to develop a regulatory structure to exploit mineral finds and market future tenders. Asked if relations with Greenland or Denmark had deteriorated since Trump's offer to buy the territory, Fannon responded: ""I've only seen the strongest relationship with Greenland as well as with Denmark ... It's a very positive relationship."" Greenland is gaining attention as global superpowers including China, Russia and the United States look toward the Arctic region for mineral resources and strategic waterways. A defence treaty between NATO allies Denmark and the United States dating back to 1951 gives the U.S. military rights over the Thule Air Base in northern Greenland. After Trump cancelled his planned meeting with his Danish counterpart in August, Greenland’s foreign minister Ane Lone Bagger told Reuters: ""We are open for business, but we're not for sale.""

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26V6DR	"By Nellie Peyton NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Major chocolate companies such as Godiva, Lindt and Hershey are failing to keep child labor out of their supply chains, according to a new ranking by activists released on Thursday. Godiva was rated the worst, followed by Ferrero and Mondalez on a scorecard of efforts to reduce child labor and deforestation published by the activist group Green America. Mars and Nestle were rated slightly better than Lindt and Hershey, while seven smaller companies received the best grade, including Alter Eco, Divine and Tony's Chocolonely. Most of the world's cocoa is grown by poor family farmers in the West African countries of Ghana and Ivory Coast, where an estimated 1.6 million children work in the industry. While companies are making efforts to fix the problem, Green America said it is too early to see results for some, while others received low grades for lack of transparency. ""This Halloween and every day, children should be able to enjoy candies that aren't made by child laborers,"" said Charlotte Tate, Green America's labor justice manager. ""Big brands must do more to tackle these issues, and buying ethically sourced chocolate is one way for consumers to put pressure on brands to change their practices,"" she said. Godiva, which received the worst ranking, said it purchases cocoa through third parties which put it at a scoring disadvantage. ""We ensure ethical sourcing through agreements with our suppliers to comply with our GODIVA Code of Conduct, which explicitly prohibits the use of forced and child labor,"" a company spokeswoman said in an email. Other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Most major chocolate companies are working to increase the proportion of their cocoa that is certified as ethical by groups such as Fair Trade and Rainforest Alliance, or through their own certification programs. Many have the goal of sourcing 100% certified cocoa by 2020. But Green America said buying certified cocoa is not enough, citing other issues such as whether companies had initiatives to support communities and raise farmers' incomes. Most cocoa farming families live below the World Bank's poverty line of $2 a day, fuelling child labor, according to the charity International Cocoa Initiative (ICI). Ghana and Ivory Coast on Thursday said that cocoa companies were too focused on their own sustainability plans versus a payment plan called the living income differential (LID), which the countries introduced this year to ease farmer poverty. ""The two countries (are) therefore re-examining all sustainability and certification programs for the 2019/20 season,"" they said in a joint statement.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26V5Z1	"By Oscar Lopez MEXICO CITY, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Time magazine on Thursday named a top Brazilian drag queen and LGBT+ advocate as one of 10 young people “changing the world” in its biannual list. Pabllo Vittar, a 24-year-old Brazilian drag pop singer, was included alongside other rising stars from around the world such as rapper Stormzy in Time’s roster of “Next Generation Leaders.” Vittar “has established herself as someone to watch on many fronts...using her platform as a musical star to demand equality for LGBT communities in Brazil and beyond,” the U.S. magazine said. The drag performer, who identifies as gay and genderfluid, has become something of an internet sensation in recent years, racking up half a billion Spotify streams and a billion YouTube views as well as garnering nine million Instagram followers. Vittar has also collaborated with major international artists like Charli XCX and Major Lazer, whose popular song “Sua Cara” featuring Vittar was nominated for a Latin Grammy award last year - a first for a drag artist. The young Brazilian’s prominence has become particularly significant since the election last year of President Jair Bolsonaro, who once described himself as a ""proud"" homophobe and has taken steps to clamp down on LGBT+ expression. ""I feel really ashamed to be a Brazilian sometimes because of this president,” Vittar told Time. ""People are dying. People are having their homes and rights taken away,"" she said. While its Supreme Court ruled in June that homophobia and transphobia are crimes, Brazil remains a deeply religious country where both the Catholic Church and the popular evangelical Christian movement frequently criticize gay rights. It is also one of the world’s deadliest countries for LGBT+ people, with 320 gay and trans people murdered there last year, according to watchdog group Grupo Gay da Bahia. LGBT+ rights campaigners welcomed Time's announcement as coming at a particularly precarious time. ""I think it’s extremely important,” said lawyer and activist Luis Arruda. ""She brings an incredible visibility for the LGBT+ issue. Not just in Brazil but internationally,” Arruda said of Vittar. On taking office in January, ex-army officer Bolsonaro cut LGBT+ concerns from the human rights ministry's responsibilities and announced plans to purge all references to homosexuality, feminism or violence against women from school textbooks. The conservative leader also pushed to have funding for films, including a handful of LGBT-themed projects, suspended by the national film agency, a move that was blocked by a judge earlier this week. Amid this crackdown, Vittar has become a rising global gay icon, performing at World Pride in New York in June this year and at Rio’s carnival festivities last year. Arruda said the visibility of Vittar and other openly gay artists in Brazil is now more important than ever. ""Despite Bolsonaro, there's a lot going on in parallel,” Arruda said. ""Censorship is very strong here, it’s very difficult. But  people are still fighting."" It was the second time this year that Time has included an LGBT+ advocate from Brazil on its list, with openly gay congressman David Miranda named in the May edition. ""Congratulations beautiful, you really deserve this recognition,” Miranda wrote on Vittar’s Instagram page. Others on the list include Moroccan feminist and comic artist Zainab Fasiki and American opera singer Davone Tines. (Reporting by Oscar Lopez, editing by Chris Michaud.

Hundreds of the migrants have been sleeping for weeks on the end of the bridge in Matamoros, Mexico, a city known for gang violence and for cartels that control human trafficking. Many of those living in tents or on the sidewalk in a plaza abutting the bridge are awaiting court dates for hearings in the United States weeks or months later under a U.S. policy called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP). Video shot by a Reuters photographer showed men, women and children, some lying on blankets, midway across the bridge over the Rio Grande. Dozens of U.S. border agents stood behind a gate topped with razor wire, which blocked the path into the United States. Some migrants said they were trying to cross as a group into the United States, and were frustrated that court dates kept being pushed backwards, leaving them uncertain of how long they would be stuck in Mexico. ""We want to argue to cross over - we didn't ask to be in Mexico, they sent us here unjustly,"" said a man who declined to give his name. He said he had a court date in the United States. Matamoros mayor Mario Lopez and a Mexican migration official pleaded with asylum-seekers to clear the blockage. A Honduran man responded by indicating the lumps and rash on the throat of his young daughter, which he attributed to unhygienic conditions in the camp. He said Mexican officials encouraged those in the camp to take a government paid-for bus back to the border with Guatemala, instead of pursuing their U.S. asylum claims. He said this was not a safe option for his family. ""I'd have to go back to Honduras. And you know the news there. If we go back to Honduras, in one day, in 24 hours, we're dead."" Tens of thousands of Hondurans have fled gang violence and criminality in the country, whose murder rate ranks among the world’s highest. Elias Rodriguez, public affairs liaison for U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Brownsville, wrote in a statement that traffic on the Gateway bridge between the two cities remained closed in both directions and that Thursday's MPP immigration court hearings were being rescheduled. Rodriguez separately told Reuters there had been no violence. More than 51,000 migrants, mostly asylum seekers, have been returned to Mexico under MPP. At least 8,000 have been sent to Matamoros, a border city in crime-wracked Taumaulipas state, since the policy was expanded in July from other parts of the U.S.-Mexico border. Their sense of uncertainty comes amid news of shifting U.S. policies. The U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision last month that would allow the U.S. government to deny asylum to people who have passed through a third country, such as Mexico, and not requested refuge there first.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft, speaking after a closed-door meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Syria, did not specify what those consequences could be. Turkey pounded U.S.-allied Kurdish militia in Syria for a second day on Thursday, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee and killing dozens.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26V5FT	"By Nellie Peyton NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda on Thursday announced plans for a bill that would impose the death penalty on homosexuals, following plans announced by Brunei earlier this year to do the same. Same-sex relations are illegal in at least 68 countries around the world, according to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA). In addition to Uganda and Brunei, here are eight countries that have recently moved to roll back LGBT+ rights.  1. United States The United States began implementing a ban on transgender people serving in the military this year, after President Donald Trump announced the change in 2017. Trump cited medical costs as one reason for rolling back a 2016 policy of his predecessor Barack Obama, which had allowed transgender people to serve openly for the first time and also receive medical care to transition genders.  2. Russia Russia fined its first minor last year under a so-called ""gay propaganda"" law that has been increasingly used to repress the LGBT+ community. The 2013 law makes illegal any event or act regarded by the authorities as an attempt to promote homosexuality to minors. It has been used to stop gay pride marches and detain gay rights activists.  3. Poland Poland's ruling party leader condemned gay pride marches this year and said the rule of law should be used to regulate what he called a ""travelling theatre"". Ahead of elections later this month, the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party has used its anti-LGBT+ stance as a key campaign issue, which critics say has fomented violence toward the gay community.  4. Indonesia Indonesia has drafted a law that would ban gay sex, which parliament delayed voting on last month amid protests. The proposed revisions to the criminal code also include a ban on sex outside of marriage, a four-year jail term for abortions in the absence of a medical emergency or rape and a prison term for black magic.  5. Nigeria Nigeria passed a bill in 2014 that criminalized same-sex relationships with penalties of up to 14 years in prison. Authorities charged 43 people with homosexual acts in one case in 2017, ordering most to undergo monitoring and ""sexual rehabilitation.""  6. Malaysia Malaysia's LGBT+ community has faced growing persecution, with two women caned in public for ""attempting lesbian sex"" in the state of Terengganu last year. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the leader of a new government elected last year, has said the country cannot accept same-sex marriage or LGBT+ rights.  7. Chad Chad introduced a new penal code in 2017 with light prison sentences and fines for same-sex relations which had not been explicitly criminalized before, although there was a law condemning ""acts against nature"", according to the ILGA. An earlier draft of the legislation from 2014 would have criminalized gay sex with up to 20 years in prison.  8. Slovakia Slovakia inserted a definition of traditional marriage in its constitution in 2014. In 2015 the country held a referendum which would have strengthened its ban on marriage and child adoption by same-sex couples, but it failed to pass on low voter turnout.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26V5ZV	"(Adds government spokesman, colour) By Emma Batha LONDON, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The sister of Iran's national football captain said the lifting of a ban on women in stadiums for Thursday's World Cup qualifier did not go far enough, with many female fans unable to buy tickets even though seats were available. Maryam Shojaei, who made international headlines when she protested against the ban at last year's World Cup in Russia, said she was angered to see women and men separated by bars in Tehran's 78,000 capacity Azadi Stadium. ""This is not what we've fought for,"" Shojaei tweeted before the match against Cambodia which Iran won 14-0. Under pressure from world governing body FIFA, Iranian authorities allocated seats to women in four sectors of the stadium, lifting a ban in place for over 40 years. ""It's a good thing, but part of me is very angry, especially about the bars between the women and men,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Shojaei said only 3,500 tickets were allocated for women even though there were many empty seats in the stadium. ""This is a direct example of gender discrimination when there are thousands of empty seats and women can't buy tickets. Many women are very angry,"" she said by phone from Turkey. Shojaei called on FIFA to ensure that Iran lifts the ban completely and permanently so that women have the same access to tickets as men for all matches countrywide. Government spokesman Ali Rabiei said he viewed women's presence at the stadium as a positive step, according to the official IRNA news agency. ""The infrastructure of Azadi stadium is ready for the presence of women. But the cultural and mental infrastructure must be ready,"" he added. One reason given for the ban is that it protects women from hearing fans swear. A report posted by the semi-official Fars news agency warned that women attending Thursday's match could be exposed to foul language, drug use and even violence. But Shojaei said the ban was ""very embarrassing"" and out of step with modern Iran. ""I don't think these bars will protect women from vulgar and coarse words,"" she added. ""It's very odd. Why can we sit next to each other in other public spaces, but not in stadiums? If a guy wants to go to a match with his 10-year-old daughter he can't.""  'HATED BAN' FIFA stepped up pressure on Iran following the death of football fan Sahar Khodayari last month, who set herself on fire in protest at her arrest for trying to get into a match. Video footage posted on Twitter showed some supporters chanting ""Blue Girl, Blue Girl"" - a reference to the colours of Khodayari's team, Esteghlal. Shojaei said Khodayari's death had changed attitudes among the public, but not officials. The activist said she believed the stadium ban had become symbolic for officials who she thought feared that women would demand more rights if they caved in. ""I think they think that if they give in on this they will have to give in on other things,"" she added. Minky Worden of Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the ban was never just about sport. ""The only logic for keeping this hated ban in place for so long is that, if this ban fell, women would insist on other basic rights - and they absolutely should,"" she added. HRW said women photographers had been banned from covering Thursday's match and that it had lodged a complaint with FIFA. ""Iran is still not playing by the rules,"" Worden said. ""The ban is crumbling, but it's not gone."" No one at FIFA was immediately available for comment. Shojaei's campaign attracted international attention last year when she raised a banner during Iran's World Cup matches with the slogan: ""Support Iranian women to attend stadiums #NoBan4Women"". On Thursday she said her brother Masoud supported lifting the ban and she believed most other players did too. ""My mother used to go and watch matches all the time when she was young, but she has never seen her son play,"" she said. ""We are very proud of him, but we are not proud of this situation."" Shojaei, who has protested at international matches for five years, launched an online petition ahead of last year's World Cup which she submitted to FIFA in June. ""We will keep working on this until the day it is normal for women to watch football just like in other places in the world,"" she added.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26T1RG	"By Umberto Bacchi COPENHAGEN, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From electric buses to pollution-sucking urban gardens, cities around the world are experimenting with ways to ensure global climate goals are met, as they account for about three-quarters of planet-warming emissions, according to the United Nations. Here are seven award-winning initiatives to make cities greener, announced by the C40 network of cities tackling climate change on Thursday:  1. MEDELLIN, Colombia - Colombia's second city has invested more than $16 million to plant almost 9,000 trees to form 30 ""green corridors"" across the city since 2016. Besides capturing pollution, the plants have helped reduce average temperatures in the city by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) and increased biodiversity, providing friendly habitats for animals. 2. ACCRA, Ghana - Since 2016, Accra has been working with more than 600 informal refuse collectors, who used to dump rubbish that was burned at illegal open-air sites, causing pollution. More waste is now being collected, recycled and disposed of safely. 3. KOLKATA, India - Kolkata is planning to have its entire 5,000-strong bus fleet, as well as ferries crossing the Ganges River, run on electricity by 2030. It has bought 80 electric buses and plans to add another 100 next year. 4. LONDON, United Kingdom - London introduced the world's first Ultra Low Emission Zone in 2019, requiring all vehicles passing through the city centre to meet strict emissions standards or pay a fee. Within months, the number of more polluting vehicles fell by a third as people were pushed to walk, cycle or use public transport. 5. SAN FRANCISCO, United States - San Francisco's CleanPowerSF programme allows residents to get their electricity completely or in large part from renewable sources at competitive rates. The city hopes this will help it achieve a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2025. 6. GUANGZHOU, China - Since 2017, Guangzhou has invested $2.1 billion to convert its entire fleet of 11,220 buses to run on electricity and installed some 4,000 charging stations to power them. This has reduced air pollution and noise as well as the city's transport system operational costs. 7. SEOUL, South Korea - Seoul has subsidised the installation of solar panels on balconies and rooftops of 1 million homes since 2017, as well as city buildings like schools and parking lots. The city hopes to produce up to 1 GW of solar energy - equal to that generated by a nuclear reactor - by 2022.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26F77H	"By Oscar Lopez MEXICO CITY, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When an Avengers comic featuring a gay kiss was banned from Brazil's largest book festival, author Nana Queiroz stuffed copies of her latest bestseller into a suitcase in a bid to outwit authorities' latest move to silence LGBT+ storytellers. ""I decided that if they didn't allow us to sell the books at the fair, I would go on the streets and do it there,"" said Queiroz, who was promoting ""Eu, Travesti"" or ""I, Transvestite"" co-written with transvestite activist Luisa Marilac. In the end, Brazil's highest court ruled that banning books over LGBT+ content was illegal and Queiroz was able to sell her book without it being confiscated by officials from the mayor's office in Rio de Janeiro. But the incident has given impetus to artists, politicians and lawyers to push back against efforts to stop LGBT+ stories being told, which have intensified since self-proclaimed ""proud"" homophobe, President Jair Bolsonaro came to power in January. ""This type of state intervention into culture has been normalised, which is very worrying,"" said Renan Quinalha, a law professor at the Federal University of Sao Paulo. Although same-sex marriage has been legal in Brazil since 2013, it is a deeply religious country where homophobia is common and both the Catholic Church and the popular evangelical Christian movement frequently criticise gay rights. It is also one of the most dangerous countries in the world for LGBT+ people, with 320 gay and trans people murdered last year, according to watchdog group Grupo Gay da Bahia. Upon assuming office, ex-army officer Bolsonaro removed LGBT+ concerns from the responsibilities of the human rights ministry and announced plans to delete from school textbooks all references to homosexuality, feminism or violence against women. ""I was born in (1985) the year that the dictatorship fell here in Brazil,"" Queiroz told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""I thought I would never have to face censorship again in this country. But here we are, fighting.""  NEVER AGAIN After September's attempted Rio comic book ban, about 70 authors and editors signed a manifesto opposing censorship which read, ""We don't need someone to tell us what we can read, think, write, speak or how we should relate to each other"". Some 200 opposition politicians also launched a cross-party initiative to improve literacy among ordinary Brazilians by pushing for more investment in public libraries and realisation of a 2010 law requiring all schools to have libraries by 2020. They are holding public hearings, meetings and seminars across the country to encourage reading and ensure more people have access to books across Brazil. The lawmakers also published a ""manifesto against censorship"", condemning the incident in Rio as ""another attempt to hold Brazil hostage to a ... reactionary, outdated political way of thinking"". ""We've seen an escalation in this authoritarian government with very serious cases of censorship,"" said Fernanda Melchionna, a deputy with the Socialism and Liberty Party. ""That's why we decided at the last minute to launch this manifesto so that we could say: censorship - never again."" SMOKESCREEN The courts are proving a key arena for Brazil's battle over gay and trans rights, which pits a growing population of young, educated urban liberals against religious conservatives who say LGBT+ expression goes against traditional Brazilian values. Pro-gay activists scored a victory on Monday when a federal judge ordered the government to reinstate R$ 70 million ($17.13 million) in funding for about 80 films, including four which dealt with LGBT+ themes, which it froze in August. In a separate case, five LGBT+ groups filed a motion against the president last month, arguing that the removal of the film funding was homophobic and transphobic, after the Supreme Court in June criminalised homophobia and transphobia. Paulo Iotti, a lawyer involved in the ongoing case, said the government was using LGBT+ people ""as a smokescreen to polarise society"" and divert public attention from the nation's soaring crime, moribund economy and entrenched political corruption. Despite Bolsonaro's success in tapping into Brazilian anger over nearly a decade and a half of leftist rule, opinion polls show his popularity is already waning, as his government has lurched from one scandal to the next. Anti-gay voices gained prominence in 2017, when the Free Brazil Movement - a conservative group behind street protests that helped impeach leftist President Dilma Rousseff in 2016 - got an LGBT+ art show shut down in southern Porto Alegre city. The exhibition, called Queermuseu, eventually travelled to Rio despite attempts by mayor Marcelo Crivella - who banned the Avengers comic and is also a former evangelical bishop - to block what he called ""an exhibition of pedophilia"". Bolsonaro - who was a congressman for Rio de Janeiro state at the time - said Queermuseu's organisers ""should be shot"". Following Monday's legal victory in ordering ANCINE, the country's film agency, to resume its working giving out grants, director Emerson Maranhao - who testified in the case - said he was determined to fight on. While the judge issued an injunction against the freezing of funds, it is only a temporary measure that can be reviewed by higher courts. ""We will not allow totalitarianism to take hold,"" said Maranhao, who is hoping to get funding from ANCINE to make a five-part series, ""Transversais"", about five transgender people in Brazil, which was publically criticised by Bolsonaro. ""We live in a democratic state - things cannot go on like this ... We have to act."" As for author Queiroz, promoting tolerance in the next generation is now more critical than ever. ""I'm going to make a poster of this (comic book) kiss and put it on my own son's wall,"" she said.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26V55H	"By Emma Batha LONDON, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The sister of Iran's national football captain said the lifting of a ban on women in stadiums for Thursday's World Cup qualifier did not go far enough, with many female fans unable to buy tickets even though seats were available. Maryam Shojaei, who made international headlines when she protested against the ban at last year's World Cup in Russia, said she was angered to see women and men separated by bars in Tehran's 78,000 capacity Azadi Stadium. ""This is not what we've fought for,"" Shojaei tweeted before the match against Cambodia. Under pressure from world governing body FIFA, Iranian authorities allocated seats to women in four sectors of the stadium for the match against Cambodia - lifting a ban in place for over 40 years. ""It's a good thing, but part of me is very angry, especially about the bars between the women and men,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Shojaei said only 3,500 tickets has been allocated for women even though there were many empty seats in the stadium. ""This is a direct example of gender discrimination when there are thousands of empty seats and women can't buy tickets. Many women are very angry,"" she said by phone from Turkey. Shojaei called on FIFA to ensure that Iran lifts the ban completely and permanently so that women have the same access to tickets as men for all matches countrywide. One of the reasons given for the ban is that it protects women from hearing fans swear, but Shojaei said it was ""very embarrassing"" and out of step with modern Iran. ""I don't think these bars will protect women from vulgar and coarse words,"" she added. ""It's very odd. Why can we sit next to each other in other public spaces, but not in stadiums? If a guy wants to go to a match with his 10-year-old daughter he can't.""  'HATED BAN' FIFA stepped up pressure on Iran following the death of a football fan last month, who set herself on fire to protest against her arrest for trying to get into a match. Shojaei said the death of Sahar Khodayari - dubbed ""Blue Girl"" after her team Esteghlal's colours - had changed attitudes among the public, but not officials. The activist said she believed the stadium ban had become symbolic for officials who she thought feared that women would demand more rights if they caved in. ""I think they think that if they give in on this they will have to give in on other things,"" she added. Human Rights Watch's Minky Worden said the ban was never just about sport. ""The only logic for keeping this hated ban in place for so long is that, if this ban fell, women would insist on other basic rights - and they absolutely should,"" she added. HRW said women photographers had been banned from covering Thursday's match and that it had lodged a complaint with FIFA. ""Iran is still not playing by the rules,"" Worden said. ""The ban is crumbling, but it's not gone."" No one at FIFA was immediately available for comment. Shojaei's campaign attracted international attention last year when she raised a banner during Iran's World Cup matches with the slogan: ""Support Iranian women to attend stadiums #NoBan4Women"". On Thursday she said her brother Masoud, who led the national team at the World Cup last year, supported lifting the ban and she believed most other players did too. ""My mother used to go and watch matches all the time when she was young, but she has never seen her son play,"" she said. ""We are very proud of him, but we are not proud of this situation."" Shojaei, who has protested at international matches for five years, launched an online petition ahead of last year's World Cup which she submitted to FIFA in June. ""We will keep working on this until the day it is normal for women to watch football just like in other places in the world,"" she added.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26U4ZY	"(Corrects Iceland to Greenland in paragraph 7 of Oct 9 story) By Noah Browning LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. military has conducted an aerial survey of Greenland to assess the vast arctic island's mineral potential as part of agreement between the two governments, a top U.S. diplomat said on Wednesday. The memorandum of understanding for cooperating on developing the mineral sector there was inked in June before a diplomatic flap between the United States and Denmark, to which Greenland is linked as an autonomous territory. U.S. President Donald Trump called off a visit to Denmark scheduled for early September after the country's prime minister rebuffed his idea of purchasing Greenland. Frank Fannon, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for energy resources, told reporters at a gathering at London's Chatham House that the process was ""quite costly and technology intensive"" and so Greenland had sought U.S. assistance. ""We had the navy there to shoot a hyperspectral survey, to basically use overflight technology to better understand the resource endowment."" ""That creates data room where the U.S. Geological Survey would be brought in to help interpret the data and share with the Greenlanders what the potential resource endowment might be."" According to a press release by Greenland's government, the aerial mapping would be jointly funded and involves surveying around 3,000 square kilometres in the territory's southwestern Gardar province. The data gathered would measure the reflection of sunlight, including infrared light invisible to the naked eye, to better understand the geology of the terrain and its mineral content. Fannon added that the United States planned to help Greenland, armed with the data, to develop a regulatory structure to exploit mineral finds and market future tenders. Asked if relations with Greenland or Denmark had deteriorated since Trump's offer to buy the territory, Fannon responded: ""I've only seen the strongest relationship with Greenland as well as with Denmark ... It's a very positive relationship."" Greenland is gaining attention as global superpowers including China, Russia and the United States look toward the Arctic region for mineral resources and strategic waterways. A defence treaty between NATO allies Denmark and the United States dating back to 1951 gives the U.S. military rights over the Thule Air Base in northern Greenland. After Trump cancelled his planned meeting with his Danish counterpart in August, Greenland’s foreign minister Ane Lone Bagger told Reuters: ""We are open for business, but we're not for sale.""

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26V3J6	"(Updates with fresh details, quotes throughout) By Nita Bhalla NAIROBI, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda announced plans on Thursday for a bill that would impose the death penalty on homosexuals, saying the legislation would curb a rise in unnatural sex in the east African nation. The bill - colloquially known as ""Kill the Gays"" in Uganda - was nullified five years ago on a technicality and the government said it plans to resurrect it within weeks. ""Homosexuality is not natural to Ugandans, but there has been a massive recruitment by gay people in schools, and especially among the youth, where they are promoting the falsehood that people are born like that,"" Ethics and Integrity Minister Simon Lokodo told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""Our current penal law is limited. It only criminalises the act. We want it made clear that anyone who is even involved in promotion and recruitment has to be criminalised. Those that do grave acts will be given the death sentence."" African countries have some of the world's most prohibitive laws governing homosexuality. Same-sex relationships are considered taboo and gay sex is a crime across most of the continent, with punishments ranging from imprisonment to death. Earlier this year, Brunei sparked international outcry over plans to impose the death penalty for gay sex, backtracking only after intense criticism. Now Uganda wants to follow suit. Lokodo said the bill, which is supported by President Yoweri Museveni, will be re-introduced in parliament in the coming weeks and is expected to be voted on before the end of the year. He was optimistic it would pass with the necessary two-thirds of members present - a shortfall in numbers killed a similar bill in 2014 - as the government had lobbied legislators ahead of its re-introduction, Lokodo added. ""We have been talking to the MPs and we have mobilised them in big numbers,"" said Lokodo. ""Many are supportive."" Uganda's constitutional court overturned the law - formerly known as the ""Kill the Gays"" bill because it includes the death penalty - on a technicality in 2014. Even without it, Uganda is one of the hardest countries in Africa to be a sexual minority. Under British colonial law, gay sex is punishable with up to life imprisonment and activists said the new bill risked unleashing attacks. ""Bringing back anti-gay legislation would invariably lead to a spike in discrimination and atrocities,"" said Zahra Mohamed of the Toronto-based charity Stephen Lewis Foundation.  FEARFUL Moves to restrict LGBT+ rights and criminalise gay sex in other countries have sparked protests and sanctions. In May, Brunei was forced to extend a moratorium on the death penalty for gay sex after celebrities such as actor George Clooney condemned a law allowing whipping and stoning to death. Last November, anti-gay remarks by a senior official in Tanzania led to the east African nation's second biggest donor, Denmark, withholding $10 million in aid. Uganda faced widespread international condemnation when the previous bill was signed off by Museveni in 2014. The United States reduced aid, imposed visa restrictions and cancelled military exercises. The World Bank, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands also suspended or redirected aid. Lokodo said Uganda was prepared for any negative response. ""It is a concern,"" he said. ""But we are ready. We don't like blackmailing. Much as we know that this is going to irritate our supporters in budget and governance, we can't just bend our heads and bow before people who want to impose a culture which is foreign to us."" Pepe Julian Onziema from Sexual Minorities Uganda, an alliance of LGBT+ organisations, said its members were fearful. ""When the law was introduced last time, it whipped up homophobic sentiment and hate crimes,"" said Onziema. ""Hundreds of LGBT+ people have been forced to leave the country as refugees and more will follow if this law is enacted. It will criminalise us from even advocated for LGBT+ rights, let alone supporting and protecting sexual minorities."" Onziema said three gay men and one transgender woman had been killed in homophobic attacks in Uganda this year - the latest last week when a gay man was bludgeoned to death.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N26V10E	"By Michael Taylor KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - S outheast Asian governments must improve cross-border collaboration if they are serious about punishing companies found to have started forest fires that send harmful smoke drifting across the region, researchers said on Thursday. Environment officials from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) met in Cambodia this week, where the Malaysian delegation reportedly raised the issue of air pollution caused by a spike in fires, mostly in Indonesia. ""At the moment there is a lot of finger-pointing,"" said Helena Varkkey, a lecturer at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur, who has researched the problem for more than 15 years. Indonesia has accused Malaysian firms over fires on its land, while Malaysia has denied responsibility or insisted Indonesia should act, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Indonesia and its Southeast Asian neighbours are regularly hit by thick smog from slash-and-burn clearance of land and forests for palm oil production and farming, causing premature deaths, respiratory infections, and school and airport closures. Last month, the environment ministers of Malaysia and Indonesia traded blame for this year's haze, with Jakarta calling out local subsidiaries of Malaysian companies. Malaysia's environment minister, Yeo Bee Yin, last week said a new law was being drafted to hold Malaysian businesses and individuals accountable for causing pollution in foreign countries, local media reported. But a similar law introduced in neighbouring Singapore - the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act 2014 - has had little impact due to a lack of maps and support from Indonesian authorities, forest experts said. Varkkey said Malaysia's new law would help it address company activities by alleviating ""political sensitivities"". ""Malaysia has the benefit of having the Singaporean law 'model' that was established earlier, so it has a good opportunity to examine the strengths and weaknesses of that exercise and come up with a law that will be more effective,"" she added. This year's haze is the worst since 2015, with 66,000 fire alerts in Indonesia from January through the end of September, according to the World Resources Institute (WRI), an environmental think-tank. The 2015 haze outbreak - which cost Indonesia $16 billion - was linked to more than 100,000 premature deaths in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, according to a Harvard University study. ""Of the countries historically most responsible for the world's deforestation, Indonesia is the only one that's actually reduced its deforestation rate in recent years,"" WRI Indonesia researchers wrote this week. ""This year's fires season could derail this promising trend,"" they added. At the ASEAN meeting in Siem Reap, officials vowed to work together to achieve a haze-free region by 2020. But few details were given on how that would be achieved, other than speeding up the establishment of an ASEAN centre to support coordinated action. Malaysia's environment minister and Indonesia's delegation at the ASEAN gathering did not respond to requests for comment. (Reporting by Michael Taylor @MickSTaylor; Editing by Megan Rowling.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26S09Y	"By Rina Chandran MUMBAI, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Delhi is set to become the first Indian city to fully implement a law that protects street vendors against the threat of eviction, authorities in the capital said on Thursday, five years after the landmark legislation was first introduced. Delhi government officials have set up Town Vending Committees (TVC), which will survey hawkers in the city and then issue vending certificates to give them the right to do business from a fixed spot, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said. ""Without street vendors, no city can function. We just need to regularise them so that other citizens are not inconvenienced,"" Kejriwal posted on Twitter. ""Vendors will get the right to make an honest living, and they will not be harassed by the police and other authorities,"" he said, adding that licences would be issued before the end of the year. With Asian towns and cities expanding and striving to become more international and attract investment, street vendors and hawkers are viewed increasingly as a hindrance to city planning. Vendors selling everything from snacks and tea to toys and clothes are a common sight in India's cities, with items for sale spread out on pavements or in mobile carts. The Street Vendors' Act was introduced by federal lawmakers in 2014 to help protect the country's hawkers from eviction, with states required to establish hawking zones, set up TVCs and issue licences. Unlicensed hawkers are often targeted for bribes by criminals or corrupt officials and police, and flee eviction drives which are becoming more common as cities modernise and competition for space grows from pedestrians and cars. ""The law emerged after a long struggle for improved livelihood security, legality and protection from eviction,"" said Shivani Chaudhry, executive director of the Housing and Land Rights Network, a non-profit in Delhi. ""Street vendors form the backbone of the city economy. Non-implementation of the law has resulted in their continued persecution, including arbitrary evictions, and lack of recognition of their rights,"" she said. No states had fully implemented the 2014 act, according to the National Association of Street Vendors of India (NASVI). Members of NASVI, who are staging a protest in Delhi on Thursday against the slow rollout of the law, said there was still no detailed plan for its implementation in the capital. ""There is a lack of political will to implement the law, and there is a pushback from citizens because of the misconception that vendors cause congestion,"" said Shalini Sinha at WIEGO, a global non-profit that helps informal workers. ""But walkability is not at odds with street vending, and authorities should be more concerned about livelihoods than vehicle parking,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Delhi has now set up 28 TVCs with representatives from street vendors, the municipal commission, police and town planners, who will conduct the survey. But there are few other details on the law's rollout, said Arbind Singh, a coordinator for NASVI. ""The same authorities promised implementation five years ago. Now, with local elections in Delhi due soon, the promise of implementation looks to be just a political gimmick,"" he said, referring to polls due by February next year. ""Meanwhile, evictions continue - so we are very skeptical."" (Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Michael Taylor.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N25N6GT	"By Dagim Terefe ADDIS ABABA, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Every day, Tewdros Belay turns on the tap in his home in the heart of Ethiopia's capital and expects nothing to happen. The rare times when water does trickle from the spout, it is reason to celebrate. ""Sometimes we do not get water for so many weeks - if we get water, we welcome it by dancing,"" said Tewdros, 32, with a sad smile. Like many of his neighbours in the Kirkos district of Addis Ababa, and like thousands of others living in the city, Tewdros has struggled to secure a regular supply of clean water in his home for at least 10 years. Ethiopia is the source of up to 80% of the River Nile's water. But getting enough potable water to everyone in the country who needs it is a challenge, water experts and officials say. The capital has long suffered with water shortages, the result of an aging and limited water supply system, lack of water storage and a rapidly growing population. Environmental experts warn that climate change will only make matters worse in the future. Hoping to ease the shortage, the Addis Ababa government has embarked on a series of development projects aimed at pumping storing, cleaning and delivering more groundwater. The latest, the Legedadi Phase II Water Project, launched in April, aims to supply the city with an additional 86,000 cubic metres of clean water per day. That would help boost the area of the city receiving regular water supply from 60% to 66%, according to Nigusse Desalegn, spokesman for the Addis Ababa Water and Sewerage Authority (AAWSA). The government also plans to install additional groundwater infrastructure that would supply the city with another 130,000 cubic metres of clean water a day, Nigusse said. ""We believe (these projects) will play a significant role in solving the growing water scarcity problem,"" he said.  GROWING DEMAND Currently, the dams, reservoirs and wells that constitute the Addis Ababa water supply system provide less than two-thirds of the 930,000 cubic metres of potable water residents need every day, according to the AAWSA. Nigusse pointed to Ethiopia's steady economic growth, and its rising population, as factors in Addis Ababa's clean water shortage. The city's water demands have almost doubled in the past five years, he said, and that demand is rising every day as the capital expands both out and up, with a boom in the construction of apartment blocks and offices, Nigusse said. Bisrat Kifle, a researcher and associate professor at Ethiopian Civil Service University, said the problem will get worse as extreme weather events such as flooding and drought become more common. Research by Bisrat and his colleagues published in 2017 estimated that by 2039 Addis Ababa's current population of more than 3.5 million will reach 7 million. As that happens, water scarcity could heighten ""as a result of complex interaction of urbanisation and climate change"", it noted. The capital already experiences bouts of heavy rainfall and ""we project rainfall will increase and the effect will be siltation (of reservoirs) due to flooding,"" Bisrat said. When soil washes into reservoirs, it leaves less room for storing water. As a result, he said, Addis Ababa and some of its suburbs could be facing an additional clean water shortfall of up to 380 million cubic meters per year. The health consequences of lack of water can be dire, health experts say. Among Ethiopia's population of more than 100 million, about 42 million people do not have access to safe drinking water, according to the Barcelona-based We Are Water Foundation. Each year, 8,500 children under the age of five die due to diseases caused by contaminated water, according to the foundation.  CHALLENGES The state-funded Legedadi Stage II Water Project, estimated to cost up to 4 billion birr ($137 million), according to government figures, is due to be completed by 2021. It will include 15 new reservoirs to store pumped groundwater and 176 kilometres (109 miles) of pipelines to deliver it, according to AAWSA data. For now, a share of Addis Ababa residents say they have to resort to buying water for everything from drinking to cooking to washing. Tewdros in Kirkos said people routinely queued for up to 10 hours to get water from roadside vendors and water tank trucks. ""We carry jerry cans and travel far away and buy 10 litres of water for 2 birr ($0.068) which will even be used just for hygiene,"" he said, adding that he hoped the government would come through with a solution. Nigusse told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the government's efforts to get potable water to everyone in the city are hampered in part by a system of leaky pipes and by the city's sometimes erratic energy supply. A study by the Addis Ababa Institute of Technology published in 2012 showed that more than a third of the water running through the capital's pipes leaked out before getting to residents. Unseasonable dry spells, linked to climate change, also are having an impact on the water supply, Nigusse added. Almost all of the electricity distributed through the country's power grid comes from hydropower, according to the World Bank. When the country gets less rainfall than expected and dam levels drop, so does the power supply - which, in turn, makes it difficult for the government to get enough clean water to everyone, including those in the capital. ""There are recurrent power shortages, so it is difficult to pump water from the ground"" into the reservoirs, Nigusse said. For Bisrat, the answer lies not in building more reservoirs, but in making more efficient water use and water conservation a priority for households and businesses. He recommended the government introduce a seasonal tariff - charging people more for water during drought - and impose financial penalties when consumption exceeds a reasonable amount. ""We have to know how to use our resources as a metropolitan city and think about climate change and water scarcity in every decision,"" Bisrat said.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26E1WP	"By Nanchanok Wongsamuth SAMUT SAKHON, Thailand, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Z in Mar was a housewife in the Burmese city of Bago when she saw an advertisement for a job at Thai Union Group, a global seafood supplier and the world's biggest producer of tuna. The 44-year-old paid a local recruitment agency about 4,300 Thai baht ($140) - less than half the sum that most migrants from Myanmar pay to win work in neighbouring Thailand. Zin Mar is among the 23,000 Burmese workers Thai Union employed under what the company calls its ethical migrant recruitment policy. Three in four of its workers are migrants in a company that operates in 13 countries and is considered a leader in efforts to clean up an industry that was rife with worker abuse. Four years after the Thai seafood industry came under fire for its work practices, the government and private sector have introduced a raft of measures - from worker contracts to tighter laws - to clean up the multi-billion dollar sector. Thai Union was among the first to react, though campaigners say smaller firms have copied its lead and the pace of reform must continue if the industry is to ward off bad practice. The industry was badly in need of a cleanup. In 2014, it was accused of widespread slavery, trafficking and violence on fishing boats and in processing factories. LEADER OF THE PACK Thai Union was among the first in an industry worth $6.6 billion to adopt an ethical recruitment policy in 2016, with help from the Migrant Worker Rights Network (MWRN), a local non-profit assisting migrant workers, to reduce worker debt. Debt bondage is one of the world's most prevalent forms of modern slavery, affecting 610,000 people in Thailand, shows the Global Slavery Index by rights group Walk Free Foundation. Under debt bondage, workers are tricked into paying to get a job, then end up trapped in a never-ending cycle of repayments that effectively means they work for free and are enslaved. Under the more ethical Thai Union policy, it pays the recruitment fees, while workers pay about 4,300 baht for permits, health checks, visas and other services. One of the first collaborations between the private sector and civil society, it spawned a host of copies, such as the Seafood Task Force, a coalition of businesses and charities that regularly audits fishing vessels to prevent human rights abuses. Charoen Pokphand Foods, Thailand's largest agriculture conglomerate, has worked for two years with a campaign group that helps migrant workers lodge complaints about their company. Another firm, Seafresh Industry, has joined with the anti-trafficking Issara Institute to set up a migrant helpline. ""There's an increasing dialogue taking place between industry and civil society,"" said Darian McBain, who joined Thai Union in 2015 as global director of corporate affairs and sustainability.  IOU Thailand has 3 million migrant workers on its books; the United Nations estimates there are at least 2 million more working illegally across the country. Many are mired in debt or were trafficked into Thailand against their will, worker rights activists say. About 55% of seafood processing workers paid a recruitment fee in Thailand averaging 11,000 baht ($360), according to a 2018 report by the International Labour Organization. ""The first thing we did was give MWRN access to our facility so they could talk to workers,"" said McBain. ""And what they found was that migrant workers were arriving from Myanmar in large debts that had built up as they journeyed to Thailand."" The company stopped employing migrants who had already got to Thailand and began recruiting directly from Myanmar through International Focus, an agent trained on the new policy. MWRN then ensures the recruits do not pay any extra fees. ""We have found cases of brokers charging workers up to 500,000 kyat ($327) to find work with Thai Union, and when this happens, we investigate what money they paid and who they paid it to and if necessary we'd pay it back,"" MWRN secretary general Sein Htay told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. About 500,000 baht of fees have been returned to Thai Union workers, he said. Now the challenge is to ensure workers pay no fees. Jacques-chai Chomthongdi, a policy and campaign manager at British charity Oxfam, said workers could pay up to four times the legal limit of 150,000 kyat at home to get work abroad. ""Workers still have to bear these costs, and those in debt are at risk of forced labour,"" Chomthongdi said. He spoke on behalf of a coalition of civil society organisations that advise the Thai seafood industry. Thai Union was a trailblazer in fighting modern slavery, he said, but smaller firms are now adopting similar policies in a bid to stamp out exploitation during the recruitment process. ""Other companies, some with a much smaller scale, are starting to catch up,"" said Chomthongdi. ""This is a welcome development. However, if they (Thai Union) don't adapt and ensure that the implementation of existing good policies are maintained rigorously, they might eventually become a follower.""  'BUSINESS AS USUAL' In 2015, the European Union (EU) gave Thailand a ""yellow card"" warning for failing to prevent illegal and unregulated fish from entering the supply chain and ending up in Europe. It required Thailand to clean up in six months or face a trade ban. The EU removed the yellow card in January this year in light of efforts by Thailand to combat human trafficking and improve conditions for workers. But fisheries associations - emboldened by a change in government - are now pushing for a relaxation to the rules. Among the demands: dropping age restrictions so 16-year-olds can work on fishing boats, scrapping vessel inspections; letting vessels swap out crew and catch at sea, far from any oversight. ""One of the main challenges Thailand is facing at the moment is ensuring that the reforms that have been painstakingly introduced over the past five years are not swiftly removed and replaced with policies that would return the industry to ‘business as usual’,"" said Steve Trent, executive director of Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF), an advocacy group that investigates environmental and human rights abuses. Industry experts are also urging Thailand to grant migrant workers the same rights in terms of freedom to organise and collective bargaining as Thai workers. At Thai Union, employees can email their concerns, post suggestions to post boxes or call a third-party hotline. ""Collaboration and engagement is key to solving the world's big challenges like ending modern slavery,"" McBain said. (Reporting by Nanchanok Wongsamuth @nanchanokw; Editing by Lyndsay Griffiths.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26B144	"By Rina Chandran MUMBAI, Oct 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Just hours after the high court dismissed petitions against cutting trees in a heavily wooded area in suburban Mumbai for a metro rail depot, hundreds of protesters swarmed the site, crying and clinging to trees as the felling began. It was an unusual display of emotion for normally stoic Mumbaikars, who braved arrests on Friday night to try and stop the cutting of nearly 3,000 trees in Aarey Colony, known as the Indian city's ""green lung"". On Monday, the Supreme Court, after hearing a petition, stayed the cutting of more trees until Oct. 21. As rising heat and frequent floods batter some of the world's most densely populated and polluted cities in India, urban residents are rallying around fast disappearing green spaces seen as vital safeguards. In the southern city of Bengaluru, residents protested the cutting of hundreds of trees for a flyover, while a petition led the Supreme Court to slam the amendment of a colonial-era law to open up the Aravalli mountains for real estate development. ""Earlier, villages bore the brunt of climate-change impacts, but now cities are also experiencing flooding, air pollution and water scarcity more often,"" said Kanchi Kohli, a researcher at the Centre for Policy Research think tank in Delhi. ""People have realised that disappearing green spaces are a part of the problem, and there is a strong determination to fight on the streets and in the courts because they see no other way to make themselves heard,"" she said. With almost 70% of the world's population estimated to be living in cities by 2050, mainly in Africa and Asia, cities will bear the brunt of warming temperatures, climate experts warn. Asia's booming cities are losing green spaces as a construction boom gobbles up land for offices and apartments, worsening the heat island effect and causing flooding that has killed hundreds from Mumbai to Manila, according to environmentalists. ""We're not saying, don't cut a single tree; we're only saying don't needlessly cut trees because there simply aren't enough trees,"" said Zoru Bathena, an activist who has filed several petitions against tree felling in Mumbai. ""Why should development always be at the cost of the environment?""  NET LOSS A fifth of the world's major cities will face ""unknown"" climate conditions by 2050, as rising temperatures heighten the risks of drought and flooding, scientists at the Crowther Lab in Switzerland have warned. Cities in tropical regions such as South Asia are likely to see some of the strongest impacts, the study showed. Nearly 300 people died in floods in 2015 in the coastal city of Chennai, where floodplains have long been built over. Mumbai's tree cover has fallen to less than 13% from more than 35% in the 1970s, according to the Indian Institute of Science, which recommends green cover of a third of total area. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to restore 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030 through tree planting and other means, alongside a push to switch to electric vehicles by 2030 to cut carbon emissions. But the loss of green spaces in urban areas cannot be offset by planting trees elsewhere, said Chetan Agarwal, an analyst at the Centre for Ecology, Development and Research. ""The loss of green spaces in cities represents a net ecological loss, as large numbers of people are concentrated there and are deprived of their benefits,"" he said. ""Small and large green spaces provide a toehold for nature in the city, with manifold benefits including better air quality and overall health,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. From Athens to Seoul, big cities worldwide are planting more trees to minimise the severity of heatwaves and floods, and to boost people's physical and mental health. The United Nations recently unveiled plans to create urban forests in cities in Africa and Asia to improve air quality, cut the risk of floods and heatwaves, and halt land degradation.  DUST STORMS Nearly 30% of India's land area has been degraded through deforestation, over-cultivation and depletion of wetlands, according to the government. This is evident in the Aravalli mountains, which run through four states for a distance of nearly 700km (435 miles). Dilution of environmental laws over the years have led to deforestation, construction and illegal mining, causing desertification, drying up of lakes, and more frequent dust storms. The Delhi Ridge, a stretch of the Aravallis, acts as lungs for the city's toxic smog, and is a cherished green space. In February, Haryana state amended the Punjab Land Preservation Act of 1900 to open up thousands of acres of forest land in the Aravallis for construction and mining, sparking protests in Delhi and in neighbouring Gurugram. Days later, the Supreme Court, responding to a petition by environmentalists, said it was ""shocking"" that the Haryana government was destroying the forest, and that the new law cannot be enforced without the court's permission. ""The loss of the Aravallis will impact water security, fragment wildlife habitat and corridors, and reduce the capacity to mitigate air pollution in Delhi and elsewhere,"" said Agarwal. But as urban populations expand rapidly, land is needed for housing and transport, authorities say, putting pressure on green spaces including cemeteries. ""We do not wish to cut even a single tree in Aarey, but development is also important. We will plant more trees in place of those cut,"" said Devendra Fadnavis, chief minister of Maharashtra state where Mumbai is located. The densely wooded area, spread over 16 sq km (6 sq miles), is home to 27 tribal villages and various animal species, including leopards. Over the past few decades, swathes of land have been allocated for slum resettlement, a defence training unit and a zoo. The site for the metro shed is a 33-hectare plot. ""We're not against the metro; we all want better public transport. But this is just a shed - it can be built elsewhere without cutting so many trees,"" said Bathena. Commitments to increasing forest cover and cutting carbon emissions are not enough, said Kohli. ""Building a flyover, or a metro shed by cutting down trees can get us more convenience, but at what cost?"" ""We have to ask whose desires dominate, and if this is the sustainable urban vision we want,"" she said. (Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Zoe Tabary.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26U2KW	"By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The European Union on Wednesday warned of increased cyber attacks by state-backed entities and non-EU actors, saying that it was crucial to assess the risks posed by telecoms equipment suppliers with a significant market share in the bloc. The comments came in a report prepared by EU countries on cybersecurity risks to 5G networks, seen as crucial to the bloc's economic growth. While the report does not name any country or company, observers have frequently cited China and the world's biggest telecoms equipment maker, Huawei Technologies, as potential threats. ""Among the various potential actors, non-EU states or state-backed are considered as the most serious ones and the most likely to target 5G networks,"" the European Commission and Finland, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said in a joint statement. ""In this context of increased exposure to attacks facilitated by suppliers, the risk profile of individual suppliers will become particularly important, including the likelihood of the supplier being subject to interference from a non-EU country,"" they said. The statement also warned against over-dependence on one telecoms equipment supplier. ""A major dependency on a single supplier increases the exposure to a potential supply interruption, resulting for instance from a commercial failure, and its consequences,"" they said. ""It also aggravates the potential impact of weaknesses or vulnerabilities, and of their possible exploitation by threat actors, in particular where the dependency concerns a supplier presenting a high degree of risk."" The U.S government wants Europe to ban Huawei's equipment because it says this can be used by Beijing for spying, something the company has repeatedly denied. The EU will now seek to come up with a so-called toolbox of measures by the end of the year to address the cybersecurity risks at national and EU level. The European Agency for Cybersecurity is also finalising a map of specific threats related to 5G networks.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_KBN1WO1AR	"(Reuters) - Turkish forces are poised to advance into northeast Syria after U.S. troops began vacating the area, in an abrupt policy shift by President Donald Trump widely criticised in Washington as a betrayal of America's Kurdish militia allies. Ankara says it plans to create a ""safe zone"" to resettle millions of refugees currently living on Turkish soil. This would then serve as a buffer against what Turkey sees as its main security threat in Syria - Kurdish YPG fighters who Ankara says are linked to militants waging an insurgency inside Turkey. Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran all have large Kurdish minorities seeking varying degrees of autonomy from central governments after decades of repression. This is an overview of their status. HISTORY The Kurdish ethnic minority, mainly Sunni Muslims, speaks a language related to Farsi and lives mostly in a mountainous region straddling the borders of Armenia, Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey. Kurdish nationalism stirred in the 1890s when the Ottoman Empire was on its last legs. The 1920 Treaty of Sevres, which imposed a settlement and colonial carve-up of Turkey after World War One, promised them independence. Three years later, Turkish leader Kemal Ataturk tore up that accord. The Treaty of Lausanne, ratified in 1924, divided the Kurds among the new nations of the Middle East.  SYRIA Before Syria’s popular uprising erupted in 2011, Kurds formed 8-10 percent of the population. The Baathist state, championing Arab nationalism, had deprived thousands of Kurds of citizenship rights, banned their language and clamped down on Kurdish political activity. During the war, President Bashar al-Assad focused on crushing mainly Sunni Arab rebels with the help of Russia and Iran, turning a blind eye as Kurdish fighters carved out self-rule across the north and east. Kurdish forces have emerged among the biggest winners, controlling about a quarter of the country — territory rich in oil, water and farmland. It is the biggest chunk of Syria not in state hands, now with its own forces and bureaucracy. Assad has said he will recover the northeast, but the two sides have kept some channels open. The Kurdish YPG militia's power grew after joining forces with U.S. troops to seize territory from Islamic State. While the U.S. deployment has provided a security umbrella that helped Kurdish influence expand, Washington opposes the autonomy plans. Syrian Kurdish leaders say they do not seek partition but rather regional autonomy as part of Syria. Faced with the threat of a Turkish attack, the Kurdish-led authority in northern Syria has declared a state of ""general mobilization"" across north and east Syria.  TURKEY Kurds form about 20 percent of the population. The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) took up arms against the state in 1984, waging an insurgency for autonomy in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast. Since then, more than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict. PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was captured in 1999, tried and sentenced to death. That was later reduced to life in prison after Turkey abolished the death penalty. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has removed restrictions on using the Kurdish language. The government held talks with Ocalan, who is in jail on an island near Istanbul, in 2012, but they broke down and the conflict has revived. The United States, the European Union and Turkey classify the PKK as a terrorist organization. Turkey's military has often struck targets in Iraq's Kurdish region near the PKK’s stronghold in the Qandil mountains. Erdogan has said he will crush Syria’s YPG, which Ankara sees as a branch of the PKK, and has sent troops into northern Syria to mount offensives rolling back the Kurdish fighters.  IRAQ Kurds form 15-20 percent of the population, mainly inhabiting the three northern provinces of Iraqi Kurdistan. Late President Saddam Hussein's rule targeted Iraqi Kurds in the late 1980s when chemical gas was used, villages were razed and thousands of Kurds were forced into camps. Their region has been semi-autonomous since 1991, has its own regional government and armed forces, but still relies on the Baghdad central government for its budget. When Islamic State militants swept through much of northern Iraq in 2014, Kurdish fighters exploited the collapse of central authority to take control of Kirkuk, the oil city they regard as their ancient regional capital, as well as other territory disputed by Baghdad and the Kurdish north. Iraqi government forces and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, with U.S. backing, defeated Islamic State which had captured swathes of northern Iraq.  Iraq's Kurds held a referendum on independence in September 2017, which backfired and triggered a regional crisis in the face of opposition from Baghdad and regional powers. The vote prompted military and economic retaliation from Baghdad, which retook the territory seized by Kurdish forces since 2014. Ties have since improved, but tensions remain over oil exports and revenue-sharing.  IRAN Kurds form about 10 percent of the population. In 2011, Iran pledged to step up military action against the Party of Free Life of Kurdistan, a PKK offshoot that has sought greater autonomy for Kurds in Iran. Rights groups say Kurds, along with other religious and ethnic minorities, face discrimination under the ruling clerical establishment. The elite Revolutionary Guards have put down unrest in the Kurdish community for decades, and the country’s judiciary has sentenced many activists to long jail terms or death. Iran's military has demanded Iraqi authorities hand over separatist Kurdish dissidents stationed there and close their bases.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26F3UW	"By Roli Srivastava and Naimul Karim SOUTH 24 PARGANAS, India/DHAKA, Oct 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - P riya was 15 when a relative in Bangladesh tricked her with the promise of a dream job as a singer, drugged her, and trafficked her across the border into the sex trade in India. After several failed attempts to escape the brothel in the eastern state of West Bengal where she was trapped for six years, Priya was rescued along with other girls from Bangladesh and India in a raid by police and anti-trafficking campaigners. Heading home and pursuing her musical ambitions beckoned, or so she thought. But three years after her rescue, the prospects of making it back to her family appeared ever more distant. For Priya, now 24, was one of about 180 Bangladeshi sex trafficking survivors stuck in shelters in West Bengal - with many having waited years for official clearance to go home due to complex and lengthy bureaucracy across the two countries. ""How long can I wait?"", said Priya, using her 'brothel name' to hide her identity for fear of being shamed in Bangladesh. ""Maybe I won't go now even if they ask me to,"" she said last month at a shelter, sitting in a room adorned with paper roses. Victims wishing to return home must first gain approval from police, social workers, judges, border forces and bureaucrats at both state and federal level, a process that involves about 15 steps, analysis by the Thomson Reuters Foundation has revealed. While the two nations are working towards faster returns, the long waits facing dozens of survivors could stymie their efforts to start life afresh back home and leave them vulnerable to being trafficked again, according to activists. ""Living in a shelter ... can be traumatic,"" said Tariqul Islam of Justice and Care, a charity that reintegrates victims in Bangladesh. ""When they return after two years or more, it becomes hard for them to adjust to the changes and recover."" ""Traffickers often keep track of their victims even after they return home. When they notice that the girl does not have a job, or is finding it hard to adjust, they target her again.""  FASTER RETURNS AFOOT Thousands of Bangladeshis are trafficked to India each year - many of whom are sold into prostitution or domestic servitude - anti-slavery activists say, although official data is lacking. In the last eight years, Bangladesh has brought home about 1,750 trafficking survivors from India, predominantly women and girls in West Bengal and the western state of Maharashtra. However anti-slavery charities that help victims in India say most are kept in shelters for years - first awaiting the conclusion of court proceedings, then the repatriation process. Justice is often slow and convictions are rare. One in four trafficking cases in India leads to conviction, while in Bangladesh, only 30 convictions have been secured under a 2012 law, with more than 4,000 cases still awaiting trial. India and Bangladesh signed a partnership in 2015 to speed up repatriations, but how a victim is treated - whether it is their experience with the judiciary or the wait to go home - varies from one Indian state to another, according to activists. A long-awaited deal aimed at streamlining the system is to be finalised soon, officials from the two governments said. ""At the moment it sometimes takes 18 to 22 months,"" said Ferdousi Akhter, joint secretary with Bangladesh's interior ministry. Yet charities say it can drag on for up to six years. ""A victim has to go through many layers to be repatriated from India,"" Akhter added. ""We are in talks to cut down these layers ... victims can surely make faster returns."" SLEEPLESS NIGHTS In a small house on the outskirts of Bangladesh's capital Dhaka, mother-of-two Basiron remembered the call to say her missing daughters had been found in a brothel in India a year after they disappeared. ""When I heard the news, I screamed! I felt as though my heart was going to burst,"" the 47-year-old single parent said. The girls - now aged 16 and 17 - were rescued in 2017 from a brothel in West Bengal where they were held in one room, beaten, plied with drink and drugs until addicted, and repeatedly raped. Two years on, they are still waiting to go home. Charges against the 16 people arrested in their trafficking case are yet to be filed in court, which refused them permission to return and testify from Bangladesh. At a shelter for trafficking victims in a village in West Bengal, the two sisters showed off sketches of huts surrounded by trees and a river - their way of remembering home. The younger girl, Neela, said she wanted to take out a loan and set up a beauty parlour when she finally returns home. ""The Indian girls who were rescued with us went back home in no time,"" said Neela, whose right arm was covered with scars - evidence of self-harm during her time in the brothel. ""We feel happy for them. Maybe we too will go back one day."" Basiron and her daughters stay in touch through occasional phone calls - they do not discuss the case but talk about meals and movies they have enjoyed - yet the mother is losing hope over their return and is increasingly worried for their safety. ""There are times when I see reports on the news about children getting kidnapped or killed ... those nights are the hardest to sleep,"" said Basiron, who works as a domestic helper. ""I haven't seen them in three years. Not even a photo. I don't know what they look like.""  CASES PENDING West Bengal has a 21-week deadline for a rescued victim to be sent back home but it is rarely met, state officials said, due to lengthy court cases in India and the time it takes Bangladesh to confirm that a survivor is one of its citizens. That is due to the high volume of cases, the fact that some victims do not share their home addresses for fear of reprisals against their families, and because relatives cannot always identify them easily after years apart. To ensure faster returns, India has started sharing photos of victims with Bangladeshi officials over the past year, having previously just provided their name, sex and age. Sitting at her desk, state government anti-trafficking consultant Madhumita Haldar showed two photos of a teenage Bangladeshi victim on her smartphone. In one she was wearing a headscarf, in the other her face was covered in garish make-up. ""But how is a parent supposed to recognise their child from this?"" she asked, surrounded by victim case files stacked high. More than 80% of the 180 female trafficking victims in West Bengal waiting to go home still have not had their nationality verified by Bangladesh and some have been waiting for over a year, Haldar said. A Bangladeshi officer who declined to be named said police never took more than six weeks to complete the process, despite some delays in verifying victims' addresses. Yet in one case, a teenage girl died of acute abdominal pain that shelter officials later linked to her withdrawal from alcohol and drugs as she waited for her repatriation order to be completed by Bangladesh, according to activist Tapoti Bhowmick. ""Within a day and a half (of her death), all the paperwork was completed and the clearances were in place,"" said Bhowmick from Sanlaap, an anti-trafficking charity in West Bengal. ""Should these girls die to go back to their country?"" Priya's story ends more happily. Weeks after speaking to the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the teenager returned to Bangladesh, having spent nearly nine years in India. She is now in another shelter, being cared for by a charity, but is set to return to her family home in the coming weeks. ""It feels really good to finally return,"" Priya said by phone from the shelter. ""I have forgotten what my house looks like, but I know that I will be able to recognise once I see it. ""I just want to go home and see my family."" (Reporting by Roli Srivastava @Rolionaroll and Naimul Karim; Writing by Roli Srivastava; Editing by Kieran Guilbert and Claire Cozens.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L2N26T14B	"(Adds comments from report and Burr) By Joseph Menn Oct 8 (Reuters) - The Senate committee investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election said on Tuesday that the Kremlin's best-known propaganda arm increased its social media activity after that vote, adding to concerns about foreign meddling in the current 2020 campaign. The Senate Intelligence Committee, which has managed to operate under bipartisan consensus when other congressional panels have not, said in a report that activity by the St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency ""increased, rather than decreased, after Election Day 2016."" IRA-linked account activity jumped more than 200% on Instagram and more than 50% on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, the committee said. The IRA and related entities and people were indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller. The committee, led by Republican Chairman Richard Burr and Democratic Vice Chairman Mark Warner, also concluded that African-Americans had been the group most targeted by Russian influence campaigns that sought to exacerbate tensions and increase the election prospects of President Donald Trump. ""By flooding social media with false reports, conspiracy theories, and trolls, and by exploiting existing divisions, Russia is trying to breed distrust of our democratic institutions and our fellow Americans,"" Burr said. He called for Congress, the executive branch and the social media companies to redouble their efforts at transparency and education. The report by the Republican-controlled committee reaffirmed findings by the U.S. intelligence community and Mueller that the Kremlin pursued an influence operation through social media and other means aimed at throwing the 2016 U.S. presidential election to Trump over his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. In doing so, the Senate report contradicted allegations by Trump's personal attorney Rudolph Giuliani and others that Ukraine colluded with Democrats to undermine Trump's campaign, as well as charges by the White House and Trump allies - including Representative Devin Nunes - that Russia actually aided Clinton's candidacy. ""The Committee found that IRA social media activity was overtly and almost invariably supportive of then-candidate Trump, and to the detriment of Secretary Clinton's campaign,"" said the report, the latest in a series from the senators related to 2016 interference. On YouTube, all of the IRA's political videos were thematically opposed to Clinton. Some aimed at dissuading black Americans to vote, while others suggested they vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein. The report detailed an extraordinarily sophisticated operation that witnesses described as the most successful influence campaign in history, one that will be studied globally for decades. The effort went well beyond hacking, Facebook and Twitter and swept up Medium, Tumblr and Pinterest. One Facebook page with more than 200,000 followers, ""Army of Jesus,"" posted only pro-Christian messages until just before the election. Then it blared a false story asserting that Clinton had approved removing the word God from the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance. False and slanted stories often spread more rapidly than professional, independent news. In the key swing state of Michigan, one study found that the ratio ""was most disproportionate the day before the election."" The panel recommended that Congress consider new laws requiring disclosure of who pays for election-related online advertising. Members expressed special alarm at sophisticated micro-targeting, noting that the IRA could have been much more effective in swing states if it had used Facebook tools for customizing audiences instead of just using geography. ""Propagandists will be able to continue to utilize increasingly advanced off-the-shelf capabilities to target specific individuals with highly targeted messaging campaigns,"" it wrote in the detailed, 85-page report. It also said social media companies, which have come under fire for allowing propaganda to flourish, should share more information about what they find on their platforms. In the long term, the committee said, resistance to foreign manipulation will require building media literacy from an early age, perhaps with federal funding but led by state and local educational institutions.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26S4SY	"By Anastasia Moloney BOGOTA, Oct 8 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Drug trafficking and organised crime are fuelling deforestation in protected tropical forests and national parks across Central America, causing substantial economic losses, researchers said on Tuesday. Traffickers are cutting down trees to build roads and airstrips to transport cocaine and are encroaching ever further into more remote forest areas to evade anti-narcotics operations, according to two separate studies on the problem. ""Narco-deforestation now affects large tropical forests in Guatemala, Honduras (and) Nicaragua, and is beginning to affect Costa Rica as well,"" Jennifer A. Devine, assistant geography professor at Texas State University and co-author of the studies, said in a statement. Protected mangrove and wetland areas in coastal parts of Honduras and Costa Rica are ""attractive for supplying maritime routes and warehousing cocaine"", researchers wrote. Environmental degradation caused by drug trafficking leads to losses of about $215 million annually in natural and cultural resources across Central America's protected forest areas, showed estimates by report co-author Bernardo Aguilar-Gonzalez. ""That is more than double the conservation budget the region's governments allocate to the forest areas,"" noted Aguilar-Gonzalez, who heads Fundacion Neotropica, a Costa Rican nonprofit that promotes community management of natural resources. Ensuring forest communities have secure land tenure, including collective land titles, and allowing them to decide how their land should be managed could help deter trafficking and slow deforestation, researchers said. Areas that are managed by communities record ""very low forest losses"", they added. ""Investing in community land rights and participatory governance in protected areas is a key strategy to combat drug trafficking and climate change simultaneously,"" Aguilar-Gonzalez said in a statement. Forest protection has come under the spotlight as a low-cost way to keep climate change in check because trees store planet-warming carbon. They release it when they are burned or rot. Deforestation rates have risen in the world's tropical regions, while Latin American countries have also been struggling to curb forest fires in the Amazon this year. The forest research was presented at a meeting in Costa Rica this week to examine progress on the 2015 Paris Agreement to tackle climate change, including commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions, ahead of December's U.N. climate talks in Chile.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26T5A9	"By Fabio Teixeira RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 8 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Brazil, which had halted funding for about 80 films including a handful with LGBT+ themes, must resume the financing a federal judge has ruled, granting a victory to LGBT+ and other film-makers whose upcoming grants had been frozen. Brazil's citizenship minister Osmar Terra ordered the suspension in August, days after the country's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro criticized four LGBT+ themed films and said that supporting such movies was ""throwing money away."" ANCINE, the country's film agency, halted about R$ 70 million ($17.13 million) in grants slated for some 80 films, including four which dealt with LGBT+ themes. ""Freedom of expression, equality and non-discrimination deserve the protection of the Judiciary power,"" judge Laura Carvalho wrote in granting the injunction requested by federal prosecutors who argued the funding freeze was discriminatory. The temporary measure can still be taken up for review by higher courts. In suspending the financing, Terra said the freeze could last up to 360 days during which time the government would restructure the committee responsible for allocating ANCINE's resources. Carvalho dismissed that reasoning in her Monday ruling, finding that the committee had no actual power to decide how funds for the 80 movies would be allocated. The citizenship ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. Prosecutors also requested that Terra be fined and also banned from political office for up to eight years for administrative misconduct, alleging he was targeting the LGBT+ screenplays. Brazil's Supreme Court ruled in June that homophobia and transphobia are crimes. ""As there was no legal way to prevent only the four projects from being excluded from the contest in its final phase, the 'solution' found was to sacrifice the entire process,"" prosecutors argued in a legal filing. Lawyers, artists and politicians are pushing back against what they describe as rising censorship of LGBT+ artistic expression under Bolsonaro, the newly elected conservative who once described himself as a homophobe. Emerson Maranhao, one of the directors who applied for funding, said while the judge's decision was a win the battle was far from over as the government can appeal. ""Justice was done,"" he told Thomson Reuters Foundation on Tuesday. ""We are living lonely times, but decisions like this make me feel like we are back to living in a democracy.""

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26S5RQ	"* Ethiopia and Egypt locked in growing spat over dam * Egypt relies on Nile for up to 90% of its fresh water * Ethiopia rejected Egypt's conditions for filling reservoir By Aidan Lewis CAIRO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Ethiopia has accused Egypt of trying to maintain its grip over the waters of the Nile with a proposal it says would imperil a giant hydropower dam under construction on Ethiopia’s Blue Nile, in a growing diplomatic spat. The comments highlight the difficulties finding a compromise between the two countries over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). Two rounds of talks over the past month in Egypt and Sudan failed to produce progress. Egypt relies on the Nile for up to 90% of its fresh water, and fears the dam, which is being built in Ethiopia close to the border with Sudan, will restrict already scarce supplies. After talks had stalled, Egypt had submitted a proposal on Aug. 1, including conditions over filling the reservoir, that Ethiopia rejected. In an explanation for its decision, Ethiopia said the Egyptian plan was ""one-sided"", flawed, and would ultimately hamper its economic development. ""Egypt's proposal is an effort to maintain a self-claimed colonial era-based water allocation and veto power on any project in the Nile system,"" the Foreign Ministry said in an Oct. 1 note circulated to embassies, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry could not be immediately reached for comment. The $4 billion dam is designed to be the centrepiece of Ethiopia's bid to become Africa's biggest power exporter, generating more than 6,000 megawatts, and is seen by Addis Ababa as a step towards redressing a historic imbalance in the exploitation of the Nile's waters. Ethiopia said at the start of the year that the dam should be fully operational by 2022.  FILLING PROCESS Both sides agreed on a five stage process for filling the reservoir behind the dam. Ethiopia says that while it could fill the reservoir in 2-3 years, it made a concession by proposing a 4-7 year process. Egypt did not mention a timeframe for filling the dam's reservoir in a diplomatic note last month that acknowledged Ethiopia's rejection, but said it was requesting that the initial, two-year stage could be extended in conditions of ""severe drought"". ""Meeting this demand is tantamount for Ethiopia to agreeing to make the filling of the GERD subject to Egypt's approval at any stage,"" the Ethiopian note said. ""Ethiopia, therefore, finds this 'proposal' a non-starter on technical, economic, and national sovereignty grounds."" After the first stage of filling, Egypt's proposal requires a minimum annual release of 40 billion cubic meters of water from the GERD. Ethiopia said such an amount was unrealistic in years of drought, and that in 1984 the flow had reduced to less than 30 BCM, and that Egypt wanted to ""protect itself by putting the burden of coping with extreme drought years entirely on Ethiopia"". Egypt's proposal to link water levels in the GERD dam to those at its own High Aswan Dam (HAD), ""puts the GERD hostage to the HAD"", the note added. Ethiopia denied Cairo's assertion that it had held up talks, pointing instead to what it called Egypt's ""unfortunate smearing effort"". ""Despite the negative diplomatic and media campaign that is coming out of Cairo, Ethiopia was forthcoming to the resumption of tripartite talks,"" the note said.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L8N25841A	"By Maina Waruru NAIROBI, Kenya, Oct 8 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - H appiness Kapota will remember forever the day when her children lined up in Nairobi to receive their birth certificates. Joyce, Caleb and Sidet Moyo were among the first children from Kenya's stateless Shona group to receive the government-issued certificates, which will give them opportunities and rights long denied to the Shona. The day was particularly poignant for Kapota, 25, because she was barred from sitting a key school exam for lack of documents, forcing her to drop out at 15. ""My teachers tried to help but there's nothing they could do, so I dropped out and became a housemaid since we were very poor,"" Kapota told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding she hoped to return to school one day. Kenya's move to end the plight of the Shona comes amid a global campaign to eradicate statelessness thought to affect an estimated 10 million people worldwide who are not recognised as nationals by any country. Kenya sent a high-level delegation to a major intergovernmental meeting in Geneva on Monday to discuss progress at the midpoint of the #Ibelong campaign, ahead of a 2024 deadline. A person may be stateless as a result of discrimination based on ethnicity, religion or gender, the transfer of territory between states, or conflicting nationality laws. Stateless people often lack documentation necessary to attend school, open a bank account, get a job, passport or mobile phone, or enter government buildings, according to the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR). The 3,500-strong stateless Shona community has been in Kenya for more than 50 years, many of them born and raised there, but they are not recognised as Kenyan nationals and have no official status in Zimbabwe from where they arrived in the 1960s. Kapota's children were among 600 young Shona who received their birth certificates at a ceremony in August, said Wanja Munaita, Kenya's UNHCR officer on statelessness. About 2,000 adults have also applied and are waiting for their documents to be processed, she added. Kenya set a precedent two years ago when it awarded citizenship to another stateless group, the Makonde, originally from Mozambique, ending 80 years of statelessness for its 8,000 people.  DISCRIMINATION Oliver Muregerera, a community leader from the Shona's Gospel of God Church, said his people have faced widespread discrimination. ""We have a lived a life of poverty and squalor since without documents (we) cannot secure a good job, own property or access critical government services,"" said Muregerera. Shumarry Maleon, a government assistant director of registration, said all Shona would be issued with birth certificates. But while this is an important step it does not guarantee the Shona citizenship, a recognition President Uhuru Kenyatta promised in 2017. Kenya has an estimated 18,500 stateless people. George Kegoro of the Kenyan Human Rights Commission said the country could not say it was on course to meet social goals such as improved access to education and health while failing to recognise part of its population as citizens. Kegoro, the charity's executive director, said birth certificates were not enough and it was crucial to keep up pressure until the community received formal recognition.  BETTER DATA Kenya hopes to get a clearer picture of its stateless population when the results of a national census conducted in August are made public next year. ""We have been told that the national census has a provision to capture data on stateless people which is important, and UNHCR is appealing to all stateless people in Kenya to come out and identify themselves during the exercise,"" said the UNHCR's Munaita. African states have increasingly become aware that statelessness is a major problem. A 2017 declaration by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), a grouping of 15 countries, highlighted the political will of its member states to tackle the issue. The African Court on Human and People's Rights ruled in 2018 that Tanzania arbitrarily deprived a man of Tanzanian citizenship and ordered the government to update its legislation, potentially paving the way for other countries to follow suit.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N26S1WX	"By Nita Bhalla NAIROBI, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Thousands of gay men in Africa are likely dying from HIV-related illnesses every year due to homophobic laws that stifle their chances of being tested and treated, said researchers behind a study published on Monday in The Lancet HIV journal. A study of the data of 45,000 gay men in 28 African countries including Kenya, Malawi and Nigeria found only one in four living with HIV were taking medication. Half had taken an HIV/AIDS test in the past 12 months and researchers said the low rates were due to anti-LGBT+ laws in many African countries, which promoted stigma and discrimination and neglected HIV/AIDS programmes targeting gay men. ""We found countries that had more repressive anti-LGBT laws or harsher penalties for same sex relations had lower levels of HIV testing,"" said Kate Mitchell, one of the researchers at Imperial College London who was involved in the study. ""Some of the studies suggested that this was due to stigma. More research is required to see whether, if these laws were repealed, more gay men would be tested and treated."" According to the United Nations, about 470,000 people living with HIV in Africa still die every year because they cannot or do not get tested and gain access to treatment, accounting for more than 60 percent of all global HIV-related deaths. While there are no official figures on the number of deaths of men who have sex with men (MSM), Mitchell said it would be fair to estimate that thousands of gay men who were unaware or unable to get medication were dying every year. African countries have some of the world's most prohibitive laws governing homosexuality. Same-sex relationships are considered taboo and gay sex is a crime across most of continent, with punishments ranging from imprisonment to death. A 2019 report by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association found 32 African countries out of a total of 54 nations criminalize same sex relations. South Africa is the only African nation to legalise gay marriage. Gay rights groups say the laws promote homophobia across the continent and are used daily to persecute and discriminate against sexual minorities who face prejudice in getting jobs, renting housing or seeking medical care or education. Hate crimes like blackmail, extortion, physical and sexual assault are common - but most are too fearful to go to the police due to their sexual orientation, say rights groups. ""Globally, men who have sex with men are about 28 times more likely to be living with HIV than men in the general population, an inequality that is particularly apparent in sub-Saharan Africa, where the human rights of MSM are often violated,"" said the study. ""These attitudes also create barriers to implementing effective HIV research, policy and health programmes for MSM, through prohibition of activism and research, arbitrary arrests of health-care providers, and disruption of services provided by community-based and non-governmental organisations."" LGBT+ rights campaigners in Kenya, where gay sex is punishable by up to 14 years in jail, said they were not surprised by the results of the study. ""It is true the law makes if very difficult for MSM to seek medical treatment. Many people fear they will be outed or face some kind of abuse or be shamed by insensitive medical practitioners,"" said Andrew Maina, programme coordinator at HIVOS. ""If these anti-gay laws are scrapped, there will be more openness, more advocacy and more awareness of the issue. Gay men living with HIV would be able to seek medical care knowing they will be treated with respect and dignity."" (Reporting by Nita Bhalla @nitabhalla, Editing by Claire Cozens.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L2N26S1CC	"By Anastasia Moloney BOGOTA, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Colombian police broke up an accused criminal ring that sexually exploited children from Colombia and neighboring Venezuela on Monday, authorities said, exposing the dangers of sex trafficking faced by destitute Venezuelan migrant families. Arrested were eight Venezuelans and Colombians, accused of exploiting boys and girls ages 13 to 17 in Colombia's poor and arid northern La Guajira province, authorities said. Sex traffickers prey on desperate families in La Guajira province, which shares a porous desert border with Venezuela, according to Colombia's attorney general's office. More than 1.4 million Venezuelans have moved to Colombia, fleeing a long-running political and economic crisis in their homeland that has caused severe shortages of food and medicine. The victims were tricked and offered money, food and shelter in La Guajira in exchange for ""commercial sex,"" the attorney general's office said. The accused traffickers included taxi drivers, authorities said. Children were taken to hotels and motels in the tourist areas of La Guajira where they were abused. They were forced to perform sex acts and undergo violence by customers who paid 40,000 to 80,000 Colombian pesos ($12 to $24 U.S.). One Venezuelan girl was tied up and drugged by traffickers, and another 13-year-old girl was held captive for a year and drugged as well, the office said. ""The teenager was also beaten so that she did not leave the building,"" the authorities' statement said. A boy was forced to wear a wig and women's clothes ""to satisfy the sexual desires"" of male customers, it said. Colombian authorities and campaigners warn that criminal networks running sex-trafficking rings are increasingly targeting destitute Venezuelan women and child migrants. Over the past year, Colombian authorities have found dozens of Venezuelan women forced into prostitution, often in Colombia's tourist cities, with little food and their documents seized. Under the country's anti-human trafficking law, convicted traffickers can receive prison sentences of up to 25 years. The sexual exploitation of women and girls remains the most common form of human trafficking in South America. Most victims identified in the past two years came from within their own country or region, according to the United Nations.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26S4MI	"(Reworks and updates with Cate Blanchett quotes) By Emma Batha LONDON, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Film star Cate Blanchett called on Monday for the world to end the ""devastating"" plight of millions of people with no nationality amid warnings that rising xenophobia is stymieing efforts to meet a 2024 deadline for eradicating statelessness. The double Oscar-winner said statelessness prevented people fulfilling their potential, and was a ""heartbreaking"" waste of human talent. Blanchett threw her weight behind the global #Ibelong campaign to end statelessness as she addressed an intergovernmental meeting in Geneva aimed at dramatically escalating progress. Her support will boost attention on an issue that has long been neglected. Not recognised as nationals of any country, stateless people are often deprived of basic rights like education and healthcare, and risk exploitation and detention. Blanchett held up her own passport, credit card and Medicare card as she urged ministers and government officials to imagine how difficult life would be if they had no documents. ""It's a condition of invisibility,"" she said. ""Stateless people are unseen and unheard."" Blanchett, a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR), interviewed Maha Mamo, a formerly stateless activist who has become a torchbearer for #Ibelong, describing her as an ""extraordinary beacon of hope"". The activist, who speaks five languages, told delegates how her hopes of studying medicine and joining a Lebanese basketball team were crushed because she had no papers. The Geneva meeting comes halfway through the #Ibelong initiative launched in 2014. But the task ahead is monumental. Only about 200,000 people acquired citizenship during the first half of the campaign, barely making a dent in the overall number. And U.N. officials admit the total may now be even higher than in 2014 because of increasing displacement triggered by crises in Syria, Venezuela and elsewhere, which has raised the risk of many children growing up stateless. There is also no solution in sight for many of the largest groups of stateless people including the Rohingya, hundreds of thousands of whom have fled to Bangladesh following an upsurge in violence. U.N. officials are also keeping a close eye on India, where 1.9 million people in the northeastern state of Assam have been left off a register of citizens, stoking concerns that many could become stateless. UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi said global awareness of the repercussions of statelessness was growing and they had received more than 170 pledges of action ahead of the meeting. But he warned that ""damaging forms of nationalism"" and the ""manipulation of anti-refugee and migrant sentiment"" were putting progress at risk. DOGS HAVE MORE RIGHTS People end up stateless for a host of reasons including migration, flawed citizenship laws and ethnic discrimination. Others fall through the cracks when countries break up. Aside from Myanmar, there are big stateless groups in Ivory Coast, Thailand, Nepal, Kuwait and some former Soviet countries. Stateless people have previously told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that they feel stigmatised and forgotten. ""We've had people telling us, 'dogs are more important than I am',"" said Melanie Khanna, head of the UNHCR's statelessness section. ""People feel totally scarred and isolated. They often say, 'I thought it was just me'. It sends chills down your spine."" Almost all countries are represented at the Geneva meeting, with some 1,000 delegates including a number of ministers. U.N. officials say the pledges will provide a roadmap for accelerating the campaign. In July, Kyrgyzstan made history when it became the first country to officially end statelessness. U.N. officials believe Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan could also meet the 2024 deadline. Thailand, where nearly 479,000 people are stateless, including members of ethnic hill tribes in the northern border regions, is also stepping up action. The issue made international headlines last year during rescue efforts to save a young Thai football team trapped in a flooded cave. During the drama it emerged that several of the boys and their coach were stateless. They were granted citizenship after their ordeal.  WIN-WIN But resolving statelessness is not just a human rights issue. Statelessness has fuelled conflict and displacement in both Myanmar and Ivory Coast. Khanna said there was a growing recognition that resolving statelessness was a ""win-win"" because it was in governments' interests to have everybody feel invested in the society they lived in and motivated to contribute. The U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of global pledges on tackling poverty, inequality and other ills with an overall ambition to ""to leave no one behind"", have helped shift attitudes, Khanna said. ""The SDGs have allowed us to talk about this whole area as a development issue and not just a human rights one,"" she added. ""This makes a lot of sense because you don't want disenfranchised, impoverished people on your territory."" Khanna said an increasing number of countries were changing their nationality laws and policies to prevent future generations ending up in limbo. Colombia, for example, has announced it will give citizenship to thousands of children born to Venezuelan migrants to prevent them growing up stateless. Other countries have scrapped discriminatory laws that prevent women passing their citizenship to their children - a major cause of statelessness. The impact of such laws has been clearly seen during the Syrian war with many displaced mothers unable to obtain documents for their children where the father is dead or absent. Iran became the latest country to pass reforms last week. There has also been a flurry of countries joining the U.N. conventions on protecting stateless people and preventing statelessness. The 1961 convention stipulates that a state must grant nationality to anyone born on its territory who would otherwise be stateless - a safeguard that would wipe out most new cases of statelessness if adopted by all countries. Blanchett appealed to all nations to give stateless people ""their basic human right to belong"", adding that solutions were often straightforward. ""It is a man-made problem and it is solvable,"" she said. (Reporting by Emma Batha @emmabatha; Editing by Claire Cozens.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L2N26B1LN	"By Sebastien Malo NIAMEY, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Abdulaziz, Aminatu, Absatu, Abdulmanaf. Fahad. And, well, also Mansour. They are the names Zeinab Garba has in mind for any future children she has. But for now the mother of two has decided to set aside plans for more offspring by using a contraceptive, to give a better future to Rachid, her restless 3-year-old boy, and her newborn son Bilyaminou, mostly a passionate sleeper for now. ""I'm proud to wear the (contraceptive) implant,"" said Garba, 20. In a country with the world's highest birth rate per woman, hers is an uncommon move and, to some, a controversial one. But environmentalists and youth activists in Niger hope it is one more families will embrace, to help reduce threats from the destructive effects of a changing climate. Climate change has meant Niger has seen a swift rise in temperatures and less abundant water flows in rivers, in addition to more intense droughts and floods, said Issa Lele, a meteorologist with the United Nations Development Programme. That is a growing threat to food and water supplies - and the pressures heighten as the nation's population booms, with each woman having on average 7.6 children, said Sani Ayouba, the director of environmental group Young Volunteers for the Environment. ""We're not saying to stop having children,"" Ayouba, who has three offspring of his own, said at a September meeting with local non-profit leaders, prompting a wave of laughter. Instead, he said, his group advocates the use of contraceptives to slow the rate of births - a relief to one listener who said he was expecting his fifth child. Around the world, a rising global population is increasing pressure on the world's limited resources, with every additional person in need of food, transport, energy and other resources that drive climate change. That pressure is worst in the richest countries, where each additional person consumes far more resources than an added child in a poorer country. But very high birthrates in places like Niger also mean the country's own limited resources must be shared among more people - a particular problem as climate change disrupts farming and herding, threatening food supplies.  EFFECTIVE - BUT CONTROVERSIAL At the clinic where Garba was getting a contraceptive implant on a September afternoon, in the district of Talladje in Niamey, herds of cows made their way to pasture just outside. She breathed deeply when a midwife poked two tiny holes in her arm with a needle and slid in the small, elongated implant. The five-minute procedure will give her three years without a pregnancy, with a 99% effectiveness rate, the midwife said. The pill is by far the most popular birth control method in Niger, but at this clinic of the international charity Marie Stopes it is an implant, placed under the skin, that most women seek, said Adama Abdoulaye, a doctor who coordinates the clinic. More women like Garba streamed in and out of the center's waiting room, glancing at soap operas playing on the television. Nigerien authorites back some aspects of family planning, and have begun to allocate money toward the push, said Issoufou Harou, director of family planning at Niger's Ministry of Public Health. But a national budget of 200 million FCFA ($340,000) for purchasing contraceptives doesn't go far enough, said Salamatou Traore, president of the Coalition of Stakeholders for the Repositioning of Family Planning in Niger. Even that budget - and Garba's tiny implant - raise big questions in this highly devout Islamic society, however. Some 99% of Nigerians are Muslim, census data shows, and Islam does not advocate limiting the number of children in a family if they are well cared for, said Sita Amadou of the Islamic Association of Niger, the chief Islamic organisation in the country. That complicates the ambitious plans of environmental activists who since last year have been working to spread family planning as a buffer against the effects of climate change in Niger. The activists have met with parliamentarians and cabinet ministers, as well as a range of community groups. At a recent gathering, in a small, damp room in Niamey, a dozen representatives listened, silently at first, to the pitch about a novel way of fighting growing climate pressures. ""It's not just about investing in agriculture so that it is organic or sustainable but also in contraceptive methods and family planning everywhere,"" said Ayouba, who spoke alongside Issa Garba, who heads the Nigerien Youth Network on Climate Change. But worries quickly arose from a handful of listeners. Muslim authorities will not accept the proposal, one participant commented. Ayouba and Garba said current projections - which show the population of Niger tripling by 2050, from 22 million people today, according to U.N. estimates - are untenable. By some estimates, Niamey, Niger's sleepy capital of 1 million, could become one of the 10 largest cities in Africa by 2100, with as many as 50 million residents as a result of population growth and urbanisation, European scientists said in the journal Earth's Future earlier this year. The country's 2012-2020 Action Plan for Family Planning commits to making contraceptives available to half of the population by next year - though their availability is less than 20% for now, government data shows. But Niger's population growth rate is not simply the result of lack of access to contraception, said Abdou Batouati, a researcher at the Institute for Research in Human Sciences at Niamey's Abdou Moumouni University. ""Culturally, in Niger, women space out their births at a rate of a child every two years,"" he said. In the city's open markets, among bars of soap, stalls of lemons and the calls of salesmen, some vendors sell boxes of contraceptive pills, stacked in colorful towers atop trays carried on the vendors' heads. The Pharmacy du Point, in the affluent district of Plateau, also sells them. On a table, the manager spreads out rectangular peach, blue and orange boxes of the contraceptives, which sell for anywhere from 300 to 3,060 FCFA ($0.50 to $5.10). But some people think that the pill ""is a way to get people into debauchery,"" said Adama Jonathna, a midwife at the clinic that helped Garba with her contraceptive implant.  IN THE PLAN? Niger is currently a national plan on how it will adapt to climate threats, aiming to integrate those efforts into government planning and budgeting. In what would be a pioneering move, it may include a section noting the links between boosting family planning and lessening climate change impacts. ""I do not mind doing it, but before that I need to have the approval of my officials"" to do so, said Gousmane Moussa, the plan's liaison to national authorities. He said U.N. guidelines that inform such adaptation plans do not urge family planning be a part of them. Should Niger make clear the link between reducing birthrates and lowering climate risks, it might be the first such case in a national plan, said Christian Ledwell, an adaptation plan specialist at the International Institute for Sustainable Development, a Canadian think tank. But the idea ruffles plenty of feathers in the Sahelian country. While preparing for the afternoon prayer on the campus of the Abdou Moumouni University, Laminou Adamou Abdoul Azize - a member of the Association of Muslim Students of Niger - said the the idea of ​​a family planning awareness campaign left him lukewarm. Islam already demands that births be spaced by 30 months, more than the World Health Organization recommendation of 24 months, said Azize, who at 30 has two children and says he will take as many as God provides. Seydou Boubacar, the former head of the Islamic Association of Niger, offered a blunter rationale for opposing family planning. ""Non-profits, when speaking of family planning, encourage youth to debauchery,"" he insisted. ""As soon as they speak of spacing out births, all they do is show rubbers, and that is not okay.""

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26S1TS	"(Adds detail, quotes) DUBAI, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Iran is calling on the Iraqi people to show restraint, an Iranian government spokesman said on Monday, after six days of unrest in Iraq in which more than 100 people have been killed. ""Iran will always stand by the Iraqi nation and the Iraqi government. We are calling on them to preserve unity and to show restraint,"" government spokesman Ali Rabiei told a news conference. The unrest is the biggest security and political challenge for Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi’s government since it took power a year ago. Clashes between police and anti-government protesters have revived fears of a new spiral of violence that could suck in influential militia groups and be exploited by Islamic State (IS). The Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) - Iraq’s umbrella grouping of mostly Shi’ite Muslim paramilitaries backed by Iran - played an important role defeating IS and formally became part of the armed forces last year, reporting to the prime minister. Some Iranian officials have accused the United States and Israel of stoking the unrest in Iraq. A cleric said on Friday the unrest was planned by Tehran's longtime foes to disrupt a major annual Shi’ite Muslim pilgrimage planned to be held there this month. Rabiei also said Iran would continue efforts to ease tensions in the Gulf by improving ties with its Gulf Arab neighbours. Tensions between Iran and its regional allies have risen after attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities on Sept. 14 that Washington and Riyadh blamed on Tehran, raising fears that a direct confrontation could lead to a new war in the Middle East. Tehran has denied any involvement in the assault, which Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi movement said it carried out.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N25F2KY	"By Beh Lih Yi KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A Malaysian recruitment agency set to launch a pioneering ""ethical"" hiring model has called for an industry overhaul to tackle debt bondage among migrant workers and end modern slavery in the Southeast Asian nation. Led by a team of three women, Kuala Lumpur-based Pinkcollar has billed itself as the first ethical recruitment agency in Malaysia, which relies heavily on foreign labourers to fill jobs in construction, factories or domestic care. The company will drop the hefty fees usually imposed by recruitment firms on workers for helping them find jobs, an industry-wide policy that has pushed thousands of people into crippling debt they are rarely able to escape. ""We are trying to disrupt it (the industry) really,"" founder Zenna Law told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at Pinkcollar's office ahead of the ""ethical"" scheme's launch on Wednesday. ""We are hoping that ... we can elevate the standard of the entire industry,"" said Law, who along with her partners is in her 20s and was raised with the help of migrant domestic workers as a child. Malaysia is home to millions of foreign labourers and one of the top destinations in Asia for impoverished women from countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines who take up jobs as domestic workers. Cases of abuse have been widely reported, but migrant rights groups say workers often cannot escape as they have to work to repay the recruiters that found them work and make deductions from their monthly wages. The Malaysian government said last year it was looking into ways to cut middlemen and end debt bondage, a form of modern-day slavery. Although it is a first for Malaysia, ethical recruiters have sprung up in the Philippines and Hong Kong in recent years as businesses and private households come under pressure to end slavery. Pinkcollar will focus on domestic workers from the Philippines in its first phase, recruiting through social media before matching them with employers through interviews that give both parties a say in the hiring process and terms. The hiring fees, which typically range from 12,000 to 18,000 Malaysian ringgit ($2,900-$4,300), will be payable by the employer, said Pinkcollar's Law. The firm's name is derived from the term given to jobs usually held by women - such as nannies and helpers. ""When workers owe agencies, not only they have less freedom to switch jobs but also to leave bad and unsafe work place. Debt bondage is what we are trying to tackle,"" Law said. Migrant rights groups welcomed the initiative but warned its implementation could be problematic as countries such as Indonesia would only allow workers to go abroad through its locally-approved agencies. ""It could be quite chaotic for the sending country because they want to monitor the whereabouts of the workers,"" said Alex Ong from advocacy group Migrant Care, which campaigns for migrant workers in Malaysia. Recruitment agencies are not allowed to charge workers in the formal sectors - such as manufacturing and plantation - fees that are higher one month's salary, under current guidelines set by the employers' group, the Malaysian Employers' Federation. But domestic workers are excluded from the clause, and typically have to spend six months with almost all their wages deducted to cover the costs they owe the recruiters for local travel or medical tests, said Ong. ""The question is why this protection is not applicable for domestic workers too,"" asked Ong, calling for a legal reform. Malaysia is home to an estimated 212,000 of about 40 million people trapped in modern slavery worldwide, according to the Global Slavery Index by human rights group Walk Free Foundation.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26L6P0	"By Emma Batha LONDON, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - As a teenager growing up in Lebanon Maha Mamo lived in constant terror of checkpoints, but her only crime was to be born stateless. With no documents to prove who she was, Mamo feared she could be arrested and locked up indefinitely. Like other stateless people, she was deprived of basic rights most people take for granted. Everything from going to school or getting a job to even enjoying a night out with friends was fraught with difficulties. On Monday, Mamo will tell her story to film star Cate Blanchett at the opening of a major intergovernmental meeting on statelessness in Geneva. Charismatic, down-to-earth and fluent in five languages, Mamo has become a powerful voice in #Ibelong, a campaign to eradicate statelessness which is estimated to affect about 10 million people worldwide. ""For most people a passport is a travel document, but for me it means everything,"" said Mamo, who became a Brazilian national last year and now speaks at international events draped in a Brazilian flag. ""It means I exist. It's finally a sign I belong somewhere.""  'MASSIVE IMPACT' Mamo's fate was sealed before she was born when her Christian father and Muslim mother fell in love in Syria. Interfaith marriages were banned so they eloped to neighbouring Lebanon where she, her sister Souad and brother Eddy were born. ""You can only be Lebanese if your father is Lebanese, and we couldn't be Syrian because our parents' marriage was illegal, so we grew up stateless,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""It has had a massive impact all my life. I had many challenges every day. I was afraid of every single thing."" Mamo was rejected by many schools before eventually being accepted by an Armenian school which took pity on the family. A talented basketball player, she was scouted by professional coaches who believed she had potential to play on the national team - until they realised she had no documents. ""That was when my world came crashing down,"" she said. ""This was the first moment when the deprivations really hit home. But as a teenager I didn't yet understand how big my problem was."" Despite good school grades, her applications to study medicine at university were also rejected. Health care was another obstacle. To get urgent hospital treatment for a severe allergy Mamo was forced to pretend to be her best friend. With no papers, even the most mundane things became a logistical nightmare. ""There are simple things you would never imagine that are so impossible; buying a sim card, getting a loan, having a library card or even going to a club to dance with your friends or celebrate a birthday,"" she said. ""If they ask for ID you have to give up and go home."" In Lebanon, there was the added danger posed by checkpoints. ""If the police stop you then you are going to jail just because you don't have documents,"" she said. ""Every time I saw one I had to run the other way just because my existence itself was illegal.""  NEW BEGINNING Desperate for a solution to her predicament, Mamo sent her story to presidents, ministers and any organisation she thought might be able to help - and was met with a wall of silence. But in 2014 Brazil offered to take Mamo and her siblings under a new humanitarian visa programme it had launched to help Syrians fleeing war. ""I went to Brazil not as a stateless person, but as a refugee. I only knew two things about Brazil - the football and the carnival,"" said Mamo, now 31 and fluent in Portuguese. Her arrival in Brazil coincided with the launch of the United Nations' #Ibelong campaign aimed at ending statelessness in a decade. ""For me, my brother and sister that was the hope. In 10 years we would have the chance to be a person, a human being,"" said Mamo. But she did not have to wait that long. In 2017, Brazil changed its law to recognise stateless people and provide a route to naturalisation. Last year Mamo and her sister became the first stateless people in Brazil to be granted citizenship. Mamo, who is writing a book about her life, recalls vividly the moment when she was presented with her Brazilian passport - ending 30 years in limbo. ""I started shaking and crying,"" she said. ""I did not believe what was happening, that this was my moment when I'm born again and my life would totally change."" However, the ceremony was bittersweet because her brother could not share in her joy. Just weeks after being granted asylum in Brazil, Eddy had been killed in a street robbery.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26L5OC	"By Emma Batha LONDON, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - An estimated 10 to 15 million people are not recognised as nationals by any country, often depriving them of basic rights most of the world takes for granted such as education, healthcare, housing and jobs. The U.N. refugee agency is hosting a major intergovernmental meeting in Geneva on Monday to assess progress at the midpoint of its #Ibelong campaign which aims to end statelessness by 2024. Here are examples of stateless populations:  MYANMAR/BANGLADESH: In 1982, Buddhist-majority Myanmar passed a citizenship law that effectively rendered stateless most Rohingya, who are Muslim and of South Asian descent. Ethnic violence has driven many to leave, but hundreds of thousands remain in Myanmar. There are about 900,000 Rohingya in neighbouring Bangladesh and smaller populations across Asia. Some are sold into slavery on fishing boats and plantations.  IVORY COAST: Ivory Coast is home to 692,000 stateless people. Many are descended from migrants from neighbouring countries who were encouraged to work on Ivory Coast's coffee and cotton plantations in the 20th century. At least a quarter of Ivory Coast's population is estimated to be of foreign descent, and the question of who is or is not Ivorian helped fuel two civil wars in the West African country.  THAILAND: Nearly 479,000 people are stateless, including members of ethnic hill tribes such as the Yao, Hmong and Karen who live in the mountainous border with Myanmar and Laos, and the semi-nomadic ""Sea Gypsies"" along the Andaman coast.  ESTONIA/LATVIA: When the Soviet Union broke up, many ethnic Russians remained in the new Baltic states and were defined as ""non-citizens"". Nearly 221,000 stateless people live in Latvia and 78,000 in Estonia, mainly ethnic Russians who have trouble obtaining citizenship and at times face discrimination.  SYRIA: In 1962, many Kurds in the northeast were stripped of citizenship, a move Human Rights Watch described as part of a plan to ""Arabise"" the resource-rich region. Before the civil war, there were an estimated 300,000 stateless Kurds in Syria, many of whom were promised nationality by President Bashar al-Assad in reaction to the 2011 uprising. U.N. data suggests the number fell to 160,000, but this may be partly because many fled the war. Human rights experts have warned that babies born to Syrian refugee women in Lebanon and Jordan could end up stateless.  KUWAIT: Stateless people are known as Bidoon, which is short for bidoon jinsiya meaning ""without nationality"" in Arabic. Some trace their origins to nomadic tribes that once moved freely around the Gulf region. There are about 92,000 Bidoon in Kuwait, according to U.N. data, but some estimates are much higher. They are often barred from free education, healthcare and many jobs.  NEPAL: Although Nepal says it does not have a stateless population, experts on statelessness believe many people, possibly hundreds of thousands, may be affected. Part of the problem derives from a law banning women married to foreigners from passing their nationality to their children. There is also a stateless population of people who were expelled by Bhutan in the 1990s.  DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: A 2013 court ruling, along with earlier changes to nationality laws aimed at tackling illegal migration, has left many stateless, mostly people of Haitian descent who were born in Dominican Republic. In 2015, there were about 134,000 stateless people, according to U.N. data, but the figures are being updated.  IRAQ: There are about 47,500 stateless people who include Bidoon and Faili Kurds, an ethnic group that historically live both sides of the Iraq-Iran border. More than 100,000 Faili Kurds had their nationality revoked in 1980 under the Ba'ath regime. Although many have since had their nationality reinstated, others remain stateless.  EUROPE: Tens of thousands of stateless Roma - an ethnic group with origins in India - are thought to live in central, eastern and southern Europe. With the break-up of Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, successor states claimed they belonged elsewhere. Other Roma in Kosovo and Bosnia have become stateless due to war-time displacement. Roma are often unable to register their children's births or hold official property titles. This can make it hard to prove where they are from.  VENEZUELA: Some children born to Venezuelan parents who have fled to other countries amid a political and economic crisis at home are at increased risk of statelessness.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26J0C0	"By Emma Batha LONDON, Oct 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Film star Cate Blanchett will back a global campaign on Monday to end the plight of an estimated 10 million people with no nationality amid warnings rising xenophobia is stymieing efforts to meet a 2024 deadline for eradicating statelessness. The double Oscar-winner will speak at a major meeting in Geneva aimed at persuading governments to dramatically escalate progress in the campaign called #Ibelong. Blanchett's attendance will help boost attention on some of the world's most invisible people. Not recognised as nationals of any country, stateless people are often deprived of basic rights like education and healthcare, and risk exploitation and detention. Blanchett will interview Maha Mamo, a formerly stateless activist who has become a torchbearer for #Ibelong. As a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR), Blanchett recently visited Bangladesh to meet stateless Rohingya who have fled Myanmar, and has met displaced Syrian families in the Middle East. When U.N. chief Antonio Guterres launched the #Ibelong initiative in 2014, during his time as head of the UNHCR, he described statelessness as a ""cancer"" that must be excised. But the task ahead is monumental. Only about 200,000 people acquired citizenship during the first half of the campaign, barely making a dent in the overall number. And U.N. officials admit the total may now be even higher than in 2014 because of increasing displacement triggered by crises in Syria, Venezuela and elsewhere, which has raised the risk of many children growing up stateless. There is also no solution in sight for many of the largest groups of stateless people including the Rohingya, hundreds of thousands of whom have fled to Bangladesh following an upsurge in violence. Experts on statelessness spoke of ""storm clouds on the horizon"" as forced displacement, xenophobia and populism complicate efforts to meet the 2024 deadline. They are keeping a close eye on India, where 1.9 million people in the northeastern state of Assam have been left off a register of citizens, stoking concerns that many could become stateless. DOGS HAVE MORE RIGHTS People end up stateless for a host of historical, social and legal reasons including migration, flawed citizenship laws and ethnic discrimination. Others fall through the cracks when countries break up. Aside from Myanmar, there are big stateless groups in Ivory Coast, Thailand, Nepal, Kuwait and some former Soviet countries. Stateless people have previously told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that they feel stigmatised and forgotten. ""We've had people telling us, 'dogs are more important than I am',"" said Melanie Khanna, head of the UNHCR's statelessness section. ""People feel totally scarred and isolated. They often say, 'I thought it was just me'. It sends chills down your spine."" Despite slow progress on reducing numbers, Khanna said there was far greater global awareness of statelessness than five years ago. Almost all countries will be represented in Geneva, with more than 20 sending ministers. U.N. officials expect governments to make scores of pledges which will provide a roadmap for accelerating the campaign. In July, Kyrgyzstan made history when it became the first country to officially end statelessness. U.N. officials believe Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan could also meet the 2024 deadline. Thailand, where nearly 479,000 people are stateless, including members of ethnic hill tribes in the northern border regions, is also stepping up action. The issue made international headlines last year during rescue efforts to save a young Thai football team trapped in a flooded cave. During the drama it emerged that several of the boys and their coach were stateless. They were granted citizenship after their ordeal.  WIN-WIN But resolving statelessness is not just a human rights issue. Statelessness has fuelled conflict and displacement in both Myanmar and Ivory Coast. Khanna said there was a growing recognition that resolving statelessness was a ""win-win"" because it was in governments' interests to have everybody feel invested in the society they live in and motivated to contribute. The U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of global pledges on tackling poverty, inequality and other ills with an overall ambition to ""to leave no one behind"", have helped shift attitudes, Khanna said. ""The SDGs have allowed us to talk about this whole area as a development issue and not just a human rights one,"" she added. ""This makes a lot of sense because you don't want disenfranchised, impoverished people on your territory."" Khanna said an increasing number of countries were changing their nationality laws and policies to prevent future generations ending up in limbo. Colombia, for example, has announced it will give citizenship to thousands of children born to Venezuelan migrants to prevent them growing up stateless. Other countries have scrapped discriminatory laws that prevent women passing their citizenship to their children - a major cause of statelessness. The impact of such laws has been clearly seen during the Syrian war with many displaced mothers unable to obtain documents for their children where the father is dead or absent. Iran became the latest country to pass reforms last week - a move human rights experts believe could help thousands of children obtain citizenship. There has also been a flurry of countries joining the U.N. conventions on preventing and eliminating statelessness. The 1961 convention stipulates that a state must grant nationality to anyone born on its territory who would otherwise be stateless - a safeguard that would wipe-out most new cases of statelessness if adopted by all countries. ""Statelessness causes devastating and totally unnecessary damage,"" Khanna said. ""But solutions aren't complicated. The biggest obstacle is political will.""

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26R0PM	"BAMAKO, Oct 6 (Reuters) - A U.N. peacekeeper was killed and four others wounded on Sunday when their vehicle hit an explosive device in northern Mali, the U.N. mission (MINUSMA) said. The identity of the attackers was not immediately clear. U.N. peacekeeping and French forces are stationed in Mali to combat jihadist groups seen as threatening security across Africa's Sahel region. The soldiers had been participating in a patrol near the village of Aguelhok when the blast hit, U.N. mission spokesman Olivier Salgado tweeted. Elsewhere on Sunday, peacekeepers in Mali's central region of Mopti exchanged fire with members of an unidentified armed group after they came under attack, he said. ""MINUSMA chief (Mahamat Saleh) Annadif strongly condemns the recent resurgence of this type of attacks, particularly in the centre of the country,"" he said. The West African country has been in conflict since 2012 when Islamists hijacked an ethnic uprising by Tuaregs in the north. More recently the violence has moved to central Mali, where fighting between farmers and herders has also surged this year. Jihadist groups have exploited ethnic rivalries in Mali and its neighbours to boost recruitment and render swathes of territory ungovernable. Less than a week ago, 38 Malian soldiers were killed in a double attack on two army camps in central Mali - among the heaviest losses for Mali's army in recent years.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_KCN1WL06W	"By John Davison and Ahmed Rasheed BAGHDAD (Reuters) - At least eight people were killed in new clashes between Iraqi security forces and anti-government protesters on Sunday, the sixth day of unrest in which the death toll has now passed 100 and more than 6,000 have been wounded. The eight were killed in eastern Baghdad, police sources said, after police backed by the armed forces used live rounds. The demonstrators had taken to the streets hours after the government announced reforms to try to ease anger over corruption and unemployment.  The unrest is the biggest security and political challenge for Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi's government since it took power a year ago. The clashes have revived fears of a new spiral of violence that could suck in influential militia groups and be exploited by Islamic State. Before the latest clashes in the Sadr City residential district of the capital, an Interior Ministry spokesman said 104 people had been killed, including eight members of the security forces, in the unrest since Tuesday.  He said 6,107 had been wounded, including more than 1,000 police and security forces, and dozens of buildings had been set ablaze, he added. But he denied the security forces had fired directly at the protesters.  Two years after oil-producing Iraq declared the defeat of Islamic State, security has improved but corruption is rampant, wrecked infrastructure has not been rebuilt and jobs are scarce. The protests, which have hit many parts of the country, do not appear to be organized by a single political group and seemed to catch the government by surprise. At an emergency cabinet meeting on Saturday night, the government agreed a 17-point plan to increase subsidized housing for the poor, stipends for the unemployed and training programs and small loans initiatives for unemployed youth. The families of those killed during demonstrations this week will also receive handouts and care usually granted to members of the security forces killed during war, it said. ""Amid all of this, I swear to God that my only concern is for the casualties,"" Abdul Mahdi was quoted by state television as saying during the cabinet meeting. Details of the plan were disseminated on social media, but there was a continued internet outage across most of the country.  CLASHES OVERNIGHT Twenty-six people were killed in clashes on Saturday and Sunday in Baghdad, the police and medical sources said.    Police also fired live rounds during clashes in the southern city of Nasiriya on Saturday, wounding 24 people including seven police, according to security, hospital and morgue sources. One person was killed on Saturday during demonstrations in the southern city of Diwaniya. Protesters also torched the headquarters of several political parties in Nasiriya, police said. These included the headquarters of the powerful Dawa party that dominated Iraq's government from 2003 until 2018 elections. Calm returned for hours on Sunday to heavily guarded Baghdad and southern provinces where there have been heavy clashes in the past few days. But violence broke out again in eastern Baghdad after nightfall.  There were small protests that dispersed without violent outbreaks in Diwaniya and in the holy city of Najaf.  ""Security forces did all they could to preserve the safety of the protesters and security personnel,"" Interior Ministry spokesman Major General Saad Maan said. ""We express our deep regret over the bloodshed."" Maan dismissed talk of clashes between security forces and  demonstrators, saying there were ""malicious forces"" who targeted both groups. But Iraq's semi-official High Commission for Human Rights heavily criticized the police response.  ""There is no justification for the use of live bullets against peaceful demonstrators,"" Aqeel al-Musawi, the commission's head, said in a statement. ""The government has a duty to protect the demonstrators and enable them to express their legitimate demands smoothly.""  FEARS OF ESCALATION Anger among the protesters runs deep, and the government faces opposition among parliamentary blocs that have begun boycotting legislative meetings.  Influential Iraqi cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has a mass popular following and controls a large chunk of parliament, has demanded the government resign and snap elections be held. At least one other major parliamentary grouping allied itself with Sadr against the government. The governor of Baghdad province, whose position is not very influential, resigned on Sunday after accusations by protesters that he failed to improve conditions in the city. But powerful political parties that have dominated Iraqi politics since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and toppling of dictator Saddam Hussein have not indicated they are willing to relinquish the institutions they control. The violence continued as people began journeying across southern Iraq for the Shi'ite pilgrimage of Arbaeen, which is expected to attract 20 million worshippers.

The 33-year-old Van der Merwe will move past Rod Snow and Jamie Cudmore on the Canadian all-time list and could join Brian Lima, Brian O'Driscoll, Gareth Thomas and Adam Ashley-Cooper as the only players to score tries in four different World Cups if he crosses the whitewash against the Springboks. Coach Kingsley Jones has made six changes to the side that lost 63-0 to world champions New Zealand in their last outing, with props Hubert Buydens and Jake Ilnicki either side of hooker Andrew Quattrin in a completely new front row. Lock Kyle Baillie returns from injury to make his first World Cup appearance, while scrum-half Phil Mack and full-back Andrew Coe are the other changes. ""It's special and something I have looked forward to my whole career, to play against South Africa. Especially as this is my last World Cup,"" Van der Merwe told reporters in Kobe on Sunday. ""I played against them in sevens back in the day, but this is an opportunity I am really looking forward to."" Van der Merwe, who emigrated to Canada in 2003 and made his debut for the team three years later, has vast experience in European rugby with Scottish club Glasgow Warriors, Scarlets in Wales and a brief spell with Newcastle Falcons in England. But he admits there is little that can prepare him for the physicality of a meeting with the Springboks. ""They are well-coached, they have got a physical pack that is complimented with a really speedy backline. For us it is just an opportunity to measure ourselves against one of the best teams in the world. ""They are a great squad from 1-31, it doesn’t matter who they pick those guys will perform and do their best. But we have done our homework on some things that hopefully we can exploit on Tuesday."" Another South Africa-born player, centre Guiseppe du Toit, joined the squad this week as an injury replacement and will start on the bench.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L3N26L3SY	"By Anuradha Nagaraj GUWAHATI, India, Oct 6 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Abanti Deka had no idea when she married her husband that taking his name would jeopardise her Indian citizenship. That was before authorities in the northeast Indian state of Assam, where she has lived all her life, launched a vast and highly contentious exercise to register all its citizens as part of a campaign against illegal immigration. When the register was published at the end of August, the names of nearly 2 million of the state's about 33 million people were missing, plunging them into a bureaucratic nightmare that human rights experts fear could render some stateless. Abanti was one of the unlucky ones. ""The notice came suddenly,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at her lawyer's office. ""I don't understand. I was born here, I have voted here before, but suddenly none of that matters any more."" Resentment against illegal immigrants has simmered for years in Assam, one of India's poorest states, with residents blaming outsiders for taking their jobs and land. To be included on the register, residents had to produce documents proving their families lived in India before March 24, 1971, when hundreds of thousands of people began fleeing conflict across the border in what is now Bangladesh. Lawyers and campaigners dealing with such cases say they present particular challenges for women. About one in three women in Assam is illiterate - a higher proportion than for men - and many marry young, moving away from home and losing access to any documents that might prove their origins. They also take their husbands' names, a move that has complicated things further for many married women in a region where family names are markers of ethnic and religious affiliation. ""The women have had to pay a higher price,"" said Tanya Laskar, a lawyer working on such cases. ""They have struggled the hardest to get relevant documents and many failed because they were child brides or the family did not put their names on a land document because women are not entitled to property in many homes."" PRESSURE India is expected to face pressure at a major intergovernmental meeting in Geneva on Monday to assess progress in a global decade-long campaign aimed at eradicating statelessness by 2024. On Wednesday, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi expressed concerns that the Assam exercise could result in some people being made stateless. There are an estimated 10-15 million stateless people worldwide who are not recognised as nationals of any country and are deprived of basic rights most people take for granted such as education and healthcare. Those excluded from India's register will have 120 days to prove their citizenship at hundreds of regional quasi-judicial bodies known as foreigners' tribunals. If that goes against them, they can appeal all the way up to India's Supreme Court. 'LONELY BATTLES' From land deeds to school leaving certificates, voter lists and birth certificates, residents of Assam have had to spend thousands of rupees to access their documents from government offices. Laskar, who runs awareness campaigns on the process, said poorer families often spent their limited resources on the men. ""In poor families, a woman's right to justice comes at the end,"" she said. ""We have had women fainting in our awareness meetings because they are so worried of what lies ahead. Many know that they will have to fight lonely battles."" Education is another factor, said Digambar Narzary, head of the Nedan Foundation, a human rights charity that works in a remote autonomous region inhabited mostly by tribal people. ""In many parts of the state, access to education for girls has been a challenge,"" she said. ""Since they haven't been to school or dropped out early, they do not have essential school leaving documents that establish one's age and other details."" State authorities have not provided a breakdown of men and women omitted from the register. But many married women like Abanti say they have been left off even though their siblings and parents were included. Among them is Aladi Mondol, 42, the only member of the family she was born into whose name is not on the citizens' register. Mondol lost key documents in flooding, common in Assam, and said she did not realise how important they would become. ""I was trying to salvage so many things from the house as the river crept in,"" she said. ""I cried when I found out because my brothers and parents are on the list. I am a little scared.""  SURNAMES MATTER Debasmita Ghosh, the lawyer representing Abanti at a foreigners' tribunal in the state capital Guwahati, said her client had not known that her married name would cause problems. ""They are Assamese and she was born here. She didn't realise that the surname mattered,"" Ghosh told the tribunal at a recent hearing to which the Thomson Reuters Foundation gained rare access. ""In fact, she never mentioned her father's name to us either, we found it by chance in an old document she gave us,"" said Ghosh, who works with the Human Rights Law Network, a collective that provides legal aid. That proved Abanti, who does not know her exact age but is in her 40s, was called Deka before she married Adhir Hajong and took his name, which many associate with Bangladesh. Abanti said her ordeal had made her feel almost invisible, but knew she had to see it through for her children's sake. ""If I am declared a foreigner, it will impact my children. They will not get jobs or benefits from the state,"" she said. ""I am not a criminal, but if the tribunal is not convinced that I was born here then I might be in a detention camp and that will be the end of the road for my children as well.""

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_KCN1WK0HH	By John Davison BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Dozens of Iraqis have died in recent days in clashes between protesters and the security forces during street demonstrations that caught the authorities by surprise. They were the first major deadly protests for more than a year.  WHY ARE PEOPLE PROTESTING? Iraqis are fed up. Two years after the defeat of Islamic State much of the country's nearly 40 million population live in worsening conditions despite the country's oil wealth. Security is better than it has been in years, but wrecked infrastructure has not been rebuilt and jobs are scarce. Youth blame this squarely on what they see as corrupt leaders who do not represent them.  WHY ARE CONDITIONS SO BAD? After decades of war against its neighbours, U.N. sanctions, two U.S. invasions, foreign occupation and sectarian civil war, the defeat of the Islamic State insurgency in 2017 means Iraq is now at peace and free to trade for the first extended period since the 1970s. Oil output is at record levels. But infrastructure is decrepit and deteriorating, war-damaged cities have yet to be rebuilt and armed groups still wield power on the streets. A culture of corruption has persisted since the era of dictator Saddam Hussein and has become entrenched under the rule of sectarian political parties that emerged after his fall.  WHAT SPARKED THE LATEST PROTESTS? WHO ORGANISED THEM? The protests do not appear to be coordinated by a particular political group. Social media calls for protests gathered pace early this week. The turnout appeared to take security forces by surprise. The inadequacy of state services and the lack of jobs are the principal reasons for public anger. A series of political moves by the government has contributed, especially the demotion of a popular wartime military officer for reasons that have not been fully explained. Some at the demonstrations were protesting over the commander's removal.  ARE MASS PROTESTS RARE IN IRAQ? Major protests took place mainly in the southern city of Basra in September last year. Nearly 30 people were killed. Since then, sporadic demonstrations have taken place but not on the scale of this week's events. These were the first large demonstrations against Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi's government, which took office in October last year.  WILL THEY SPREAD? WHAT ARE THE RISKS? It depends how the government and security services handle the protests. More deaths - so far more than 80 people have been killed - will fuel anger. But a heavy-handed crackdown could also scare protesters into staying home. Many Iraqis believe powerful paramilitary groups backed by Iran were behind violent crackdowns in Basra last year. Turnout for protests since then has been small. If tribal or factional armed groups get involved the situation could deteriorate. Gunfights broke out in southern cities this week between unidentified gunmen and police.  WILL THE GOVERNMENT MEET PROTESTERS' DEMANDS? The government has promised better employment opportunities for Iraqis. This week Abdul Mahdi promised jobs for graduates and instructed the oil ministry and other government bodies to include a 50% quota for local workers in subsequent contracts with foreign companies. Similar promises and pledges to improve healthcare, electricity and services were made last year by the previous government.  IS THE UNREST SECTARIAN? No. Most Iraqis have sought to avoid sectarian rhetoric after the brutal experience of Sunni hardline Islamic State - although sectarian tension still exists. These protests are about worsening economic and living conditions and are taking place mostly in Baghdad and the Shi'ite Muslim-dominated south, but cut across ethnic and sectarian lines. Anger is directed at a political class, not a sect. That contrasts with protests in 2012 and 2013 that Islamic State exploited to rally support among Sunnis.  WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE GOVERNMENT? Because no political party or group is publicly involved in these demonstrations - not even the so-called opposition parliamentary grouping of firebrand cleric Moqtada al-Sadr who has orchestrated some unrest in the past - the government might struggle to control them. If they spread, it is unclear what options the government has. There is no mention so far of reshuffles or resignations. Parties that agreed to bring Abdul Mahdi to power, and which control the weak premier, are likely to want to keep him there.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26370I	"(Clarifies description of software tool) By Kagondu Njagi ILULA, Kenya, Oct 5 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Anyone hearing the loud singing coming from Isaac Chereger's farm would be forgiven for thinking it was a particularly enthusiastic church gathering. Instead, it was a group of women calling to order a meeting of a local religious charity that teaches villagers how to conserve the forest around their homes in this southwestern Kenya community, to help stop the Mara River from drying. For more than a decade, environmental groups have raised the alarm over the Mara River, warning that population growth, illegal logging and overuse of its waters by communities struggling through drought have caused a dramatic drop in the river's water levels. At the meeting on Chereger's farm, some villagers volunteered to plant saplings where their fields meet the river, while others agreed to get training on why the unplanned felling of trees along the river could worsen the impact of drought. Chereger told the Thomson Reuters Foundation he is proud of the conservation work his community does, but has long wondered if it was enough. That's why the Empowering Lives International Centre - which put on the meeting on his farm - has joined other local organisations in an effort to give their traditional conservation work some technological muscle. The Stockholm Environment Institute, an international research organisation, has created a software-based water evaluation and planning (WEAP) tool designed to help government agencies and project partners better manage water. When communities know what to expect from the Mara River's changing water levels, they can more quickly adapt and find the most effective ways to slow the drying of the river, the institute's researchers say. The group in Ilula village say they are keen to add the system to their conservation toolbelt. ""The Mara River gives us pasture and water for our cattle. If this innovation can help in preventing bad use of the river, then we are ready to work with it,"" said Chereger. WADING GOATS There are currently no official figures on how much water levels in the Mara River basin, home to about a million people, have dropped over the past few decades. But Nkoinko Siposha, from Oloroito village in the upper basin, recalled that in the 1990s it was impossible for his cattle to wade through any part of the river because of its depth. These days, even goats walk leisurely through the drying river to graze on the other side of its shores, the 65-year-old herder told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Starting in the Mau forests, in southwestern Kenya, the Mara River basin stretches over 13,750 square kilometres (5,300 square miles), through the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya and Tanzania's Serengeti plains, before it spills into Tanzania's Lake Victoria. Tom Ogol, a former researcher at the Stockholm Environment Institute, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation there are several key threats to the river. They include loss of forests along its shores and unsustainable agricultural activity, such as farmers illegally siphoning water from the river for irrigation. Both are ""aggravating what climate change has already altered"", with increasingly long droughts now a problem, Ogol said. In October last year, Rift Valley commissioner George Natembeya said the growing number of flower farms cropping up along the river are a problem, with some farmers using petrol-powered pumps to suck water fromthe river. Such pumps are restricted in the county due to the pollution they cause. According to Natembeya, water demand in the Mara River basin is over 20 million cubic metres per year, with irrigated agriculture accounting for about half of that. ""This demand is too much. The river cannot provide it all because its water sources, which are in the basin, are drying up due to climate change,"" Natembeya said during a press briefing. He then delivered a dire prediction. ""The Mara River will be dead in three years,"" he warned. REPORTING VIOLATIONS Technology has become a vital tool for protecting the river, said Emmanuel Nkurunziza, director general of the Nairobi-based Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development. Tools such as the WEAP have made it easier for governments and partner organisations to detect changes in the Mara's water level and quality, and helped them reverse or adapt to those changes, he said. ""Technology enables the tracking of threats to the Mara river over a period of time. With this it is possible to identify whether these threats are caused by human activities or climate change,"" Nkurunziza told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Ogol described WEAP as a ""user-friendly"" software tool that combines data on rainfall runoff, how surface and ground water interact, and crop water requirements. Nkurunziza was confident the system would play an important role in tackling climate change threats. But, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, how much the system will benefit farmers living along the Mara River depends on the decisions local lawmakers make based on the data. ""We might be able to identify what is happening to the Mara River, but the political circumstances surrounding the causes of the problems might determine whether there is action or not,"" he said.

Greece, the route into the European Union for nearly a million refugees and migrants in 2015, is dealing with a new and steep rise in people crossing the Aegean to its islands from neighbouring Turkey after a relative three-year lull. The influx has piled pressure on its hugely overcrowded migrant camps and prompted the new conservative government to announce a stricter policy to curb the flows, which includes tightening its borders and deporting more people. ""I want to be absolutely clear,"" Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told parliament. ""Turkey... must also assume its responsibility. ""It has the ability to control the flows in the Aegean. It cannot give the impression that it is exploiting this issue for its own geopolitical pursuits,"" he said. Flows to Greece slowed to a trickle after the EU and Turkey agreed in 2016 to seal off the Aegean route, before picking up again in August and September to the highest monthly numbers in the three years since the deal. Turkey, which hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees, has threatened to ""open the gates"" unless Ankara receives adequate international support for a plan to resettle 1 million refugees in northern Syria. It effectively controls parts of north Syria where it says 350,000 Syrians have returned. Together with the United States it is setting up a ""safe zone"" in the northeast, where it says many more could be moved. Under the 2016 pact, Ankara would take back undocumented migrants and refugees, including Syrians, who cross to Greek islands and do not qualify for asylum. In return, the EU would take in thousands of Syrian refugees directly from Turkey and reward it with more money and other benefits.  ""MAGNET"" FOR MIGRANTS More than 78,000 refugees and migrants have arrived in Europe so far this year, more than half of them to Greece, according to United Nations data. About 40 percent of recent arrivals are families from Afghanistan and about 20 percent are Syrian. Mitsotakis said most ""have the profile of an economic migrant and not that of a refugee"", and he reiterated plans to deport 10,000 rejected asylum seekers by the end of next year. ""This issue is here to stay,"" he said. ""Europe will constitute a magnet for people from Africa and the Middle East. The phenomenon will continue and is likely to intensify."" Greece has repeatedly called on other EU countries to share the burden of migrant flows. Moria, on the island of Lesbos, is Europe's biggest migrant camp. It has swelled in just three years to the size of a small town of more than 12,000, four times its capacity, and has become notorious for its poor and unsafe conditions. After meeting Germany's interior minister Horst Seehofer in Athens on Friday, Greek Citizen Protection Minister Michalis Chrisohoidis described Moria as ""a stain on Europe"". Seehofer said Europe needed to do more to protect its borders and support frontline countries, which also include Spain and Italy, ""something we have not yet done sufficiently"". ""If we don't help Greece, if we don't help frontline countries, we will end up with a haphazard migration policy that will lead us to a dead-end,"" he said.

tag:reuters.com,2019:newsml_L5N26P3IG	"By Naimul Karim DHAKA, Oct 4 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Bangladesh has suspended the passports of five citizens suspected of running a trafficking ring involving hundreds of workers in Brunei and asked the government there to deport them, a senior diplomat said on Friday. Bangladesh's top diplomat in Brunei said he had received repeated complaints from workers who had paid thousands of dollars to be taken to the wealthy Southeast Asian nation on the promise of jobs that never materialised. ""They keep bringing more people even though there are no jobs,"" Bangladesh's High Commissioner to Brunei Mahmud Hussain told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""It's like a flesh business. There can't be a bigger criminal activity than this."" Hussain said the government was taking the rare step of suspending their passports in order to trigger their deportation and stop them from operating in Brunei. ""We call most of these brokers to the embassy to solve the problem, but many of these brokers don't even care. They don't come,"" he said. ""We thought we needed to take a strong action against these brokers. We needed to show them that you can't continuously do this crime and get away."" Bangladeshis were being charged about $4,000 by agents who either failed to get them any work at all or made them work for very low pay, Hussain said. Hannan Sikdar, 22, sold his family's land to raise the $3,500 that he paid a broker in Bangladesh for a job in Brunei. ""I was told that I would earn so much that I would be able to send 25,000 takas ($300) back home every month,"" Sikdar said from Brunei by phone. After reaching Brunei, Sikdar went to work for a week, then was told not to come again. The agent told him he would have to find a new job himself and threatened to have him deported unless he handed over a portion of his monthly salary. ""In the last five months, I only managed to send 35,000 taka back home. I would have earned a lot more in Bangladesh,"" said Sikdar. Most of the about 25,000 Bangladeshis in Brunei, a former British protectorate of about 400,000 people, are either employed in the construction industry or own businesses and only a minority are exploited, the High Commission said. Bangladesh is one of the world's biggest labour-exporting countries and numbers are increasing. At least 1 million Bangladeshis secured jobs overseas in 2017, the highest number ever recorded by the government. But the country's recruitment system depends largely on unlicensed brokers working in rural areas and opens the door to trafficking and cheating. Migrant activist Shakirul Islam welcomed the government's move against the suspected human traffickers and said trafficking cases should be filed against them. ""If cases are not filed, our relationship with Brunei in terms of sending workers will take a hit,"" said Islam, executive director of Ovibashi Karmi Unnayan Program, a migrant rights organisation. Both Bangladesh and Brunei are on a U.S. State Department watchlist over their human trafficking record, putting them at risk of a downgrade that would trigger sanctions limiting access to international aid.
